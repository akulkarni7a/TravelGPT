  "extract": "Southampton is the largest city in Hampshire, on the south coast of England. A busy cruise ship and container port, Southampton is the European end of the last Transatlantic ocean liner route, the Queen Mary II to New York, and in 1912 was the point of departure for the Titanic.\n\n\nUnderstand\nSouthampton has been a settlement since Roman and Saxon times. In Saxon times the town was known as Hamwic. The Roman ruins are situated in a suburb called Bitterne Manor - which was known as Clausentum in Roman times. Its privileged position on England's south coast made it Britain's premier trading post. The town became walled in the medieval era, and some remnants of these defences remain throughout the city, most notably the Bargate in the middle of the city centre. Southampton was devastated by bombing during the Second World War, meaning that much of the city and its heritage was destroyed. As such the town and its architecture has quite a modern feel to it.\nSouthampton has grown rapidly and is the largest city in Hampshire. The two universities (Solent University and the University of Southampton) mean that there is a large student population.\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Southampton website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Southampton Airport (SOU  IATA), a short distance to the north in Eastleigh, receives regular services from many airports across the British Isles, including Belfast City, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, and the three main Channel Islands. KLM operate a year-round feeder service from their hub at Amsterdam Schiphol, but other services from continental Europe are seasonal. A railway station adjacent to the airport is served by regular trains into Southampton Central; the journey takes about 8 min. National rail connections include Bournemouth (45 min), Reading (45 min), London Waterloo (1 hr 15 min), Birmingham New Street (2 hr 30 min) and Manchester Piccadilly (4 hr).\nMuch bigger airports are within easy reach of Southampton by rail, car or bus. The most convenient are:\n\nLondon Heathrow Airport (LHR IATA) is the UK's largest airport, and Europe's primary international hub. It is about 60 mi (97 km) drive from Southampton via the M4 (westbound), M25 (anti-clockwise) and the M3 (southbound). There is a RailAir coach service to Woking station, where mainline trains to Southampton can be boarded. National Express offers scheduled bus service from the Central Bus Station at Heathrow, between Terminals 2 and 3, to Southampton Coach Station.\nLondon Gatwick Airport (LGW IATA) is the UK's third largest airport. It is about 80 mi (130 km) drive from Southampton via the M23 (northbound), M25 (clockwise) and M3 (southbound) motorways. Monday to Saturday there is an hourly direct train service to Southampton from a rail station in the airport terminal complex, taking just under 2 hours; on Sundays at least one transfer is necessary resulting in travel times between 2 and 2\u00bd hours.\nStansted (STN IATA) and Luton (LTN IATA), both north of London, have a good range of budget flights but are harder to reach from Southampton: you either have to crawl around on the congested M25, or take a train into London then out again.\nBournemouth Airport (BOH IATA) is 30 mi (48 km) west of Southampton along the M27 and A31. It only has a few holiday flights to the Med.\n\n\nBy train\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain\nSouthampton's main station is 2 Southampton Central, on the north-west edge of the city centre. The station has entrances from Blechynden Terrace (north side) and the Western Esplanade (south side), with both providing equal access to concourse and all platforms. From the station, it is a short walk to the city centre, or you can use the free CityLink bus service, which runs every 15\u201330 minutes during the day and up to about 8PM. The CityLink bus runs from the station via the Westquay shopping centre to Town Quay, where the catamaran to the Isle of Wight and the ferry to Hythe depart.\nSouth Western Railway run every 30 min to Southampton from London Waterloo via Basingstoke and Winchester, as well as from Portsmouth and the towns between them along the south coast. Many of these trains continue beyond Southampton to Bournemouth and Weymouth via the New Forest. \nSouthern Railway run services via a longer and slower route from London Victoria, but have the advantage of serving London Gatwick airport on the way.\nCrossCountry run longer distance services from the north of England via Birmingham and Reading.\nGreat Western Railway runs services from Cardiff, Bristol and Bath via Salisbury.\nLocal rail connections to nearby towns are described at Three Rivers Rail\nTrain times can be found on National Rail or by calling 08457 48 49 50 from anywhere in the UK.\n\n\nBy car\nThe M3 links Southampton with the M25 and London. The M27 leads west towards Bournemouth and the West Country, and east along the coast towards Brighton and the rest of the south of England.\nCar parking is relatively easy with many pay-and-display sites in the city centre. There are also car parks that are free up to 2 hours, and if you're willing to park a little further out you can find free on-street parking.\nDuring the period of the Boat Show there is a Park-and-Ride scheme operating from Junction 1 of the M271 motorway with frequent buses to the show entrance.\nThere is also a Park and Ride for ticket holders to Southampton Football Club matches. This is easily found and well signposted from Junction 8 of the M27. For more information on either of the Park-and-Ride schemes see National Park and Ride Directory.\n\n\nBy bus\nMegabus run a twice daily bus service from London Victoria Coach Station to Southampton from \u00a31.50 for the cost of a single ticket.\nNational Express also run a regular coach service direct to/from the Southampton Coach Station from/to London Victoria Coach Station as well as from/to the Heathrow Airport Central Bus Station. Ticket prices may be as low as \u00a320 for a scheduled return.\nThe Quayconnect bus service costing \u00a31 runs every 15 minutes between Southampton Central Station and Town Quay via the city centre. This service is free for National Rail, National Express and Red Funnel ticket holders, as well as Senior Citizen bus pass holders.\n\n\nBy taxi\nSouthampton-based taxi companies providing long distance transfers from major airports, towns, bus and rail stations to Southampton: West Quay Cars, URBAN Taxi, Jewels Airport Transfers, iRide Taxis, Soton Taxi, Southampton Airport Transfer Taxi, Southampton Taxi Co, and New Forest Taxi provide online taxi booking facility.\n\n\nBy boat\nSouthampton is a busy port city, and as such has sea links to countries around the world, however the port is mainly used for freight container ships and cruises. \nThere are no international ferry services: these call in Portsmouth about 20 mi (32 km) to the east. However, regular vehicle and passenger ferries operate to Southampton from Cowes on the nearby Isle of Wight and the village of Hythe in the New Forest. \nSouthampton is also Cunard's main port, being the eastern end of Queen Mary 2\u2019s transatlantic liner service to and from New York City. Cunard also serves other destinations.\n\n\nGet around\n\nMy Journey is a website funded by the Department of Transport as a hub for travel information in and around Southampton.\n\n\nOn foot\nSouthampton City Centre is fairly spread out along a north-south axis, however it is easily possible to walk from the popular Bedford Place student area on the Northern fringe of the central area to the waterfront, much of the route being pedestrianised.\n\n\nBy bike\nSouthampton has a few dedicated cycle routes; they are not particularly well linked but cyclists should not have a problem navigating the city centre.  The city centre is mostly flat; Hampshire tends to undulate.\nSustrans Cycle Map\n\n\nBy bus\nSouthampton has a good network of bus services, with some principal services operating as often as every 7 minutes during the day.  Most of the services radiate out from the city centre but there are also some cross-city routes. Some services also extend to settlements outside the city. Buses accept cash (also giving change) and contactless card payment.\n\nBluestarz\nXelabus\nUni-link\nWheelers Connect\nSalisbury Reds\n\n\nBy train\nSouthampton's main station is Southampton Central, on the north-west edge of the city centre.  Southampton Central, Southampton Airport Parkway and Eastleigh are all served by regular trains on the South West mainline.  Other stations in Southampton receive only less-regular stopping services, these stations are Redbridge, Millbrook, St Denys, Swaythling, Bitterne, Woolston, and Sholing.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Bargate. A medieval gatehouse, built about 1180 and extended in 1320, now sits slap bang in the middle of the shopping centre. The top floor is now a Heritage Visitor Centre. The Bargate is also the beginning of the original Old Town Walk (pdf); see Do below.   (updated Jul 2018)\n2 Central Parks, established in the 19th century, form a line through mid-city. South to north these are Hoglands Park, Houndwell Park, Pamerston Park, East Park and Watts Park. At the top end of East Park near the Guildhall and Art Gallery, note the two memorials to those lost aboard Titanic: one for the engineers and one for the musicians.\n\n\nArt galleries\n3 Southampton City Art Gallery, Commercial Road, SO14 7LP, \u260f +44 2380 834536, art.gallery@southampton.gov.uk.

M-F 9AM-8PM, Sa 9AM-7PM, Su 11AM-5PM. John Lewis and Marks & Spencer are the major draws, but there are 97 other shops happy to separate you from your hard-earned cash. An extension to this popular shopping centre, Westquay South, includes a 10-screen 4k cinema, up to 20 extra restaurants and a public square.   (updated Jul 2018)\n2 The Marlands, Civic Centre Rd, Hants, SO14 7SJ. M-W F 9AM-5:30PM, Th 9AM-7PM, Sa 9AM-6PM, Su 11AM-5PM. A smaller shopping centre constructed to a PostModern design in 1991. The rent is lower than West Quay and hence the retailers are less salubrious. Retailers include Route One, CEX and The Disney Store.   (updated Jul 2018)\nAbove Bar Street is the main pedestrian thoroughfare joining the shopping centres to each other with even more retailers, large and small. You won't be surprised to find that the same stores as are on most British high streets such as TK Maxx, HMV, Topshop and Primark have made this their home. Above Bar Street is also the home of special shopping events. The German Market runs in December, and the area around the Bargate has the Farmer's Market on the second Saturday of each month.\nA short walk to the north of Southampton's main city centre are Bedford Place and London Road. By day and night, the bars, coffee shops, pubs and restaurants are a hive of activity.\nSoutheast of the city centre, Oxford Street hosts independent boutiques, salons, bars and restaurants and maintains a more historic feel.\n\n\nEat\nThere are two main areas for eating out in Southampton; the first is Oxford Street (towards Ocean Village) and the second is around Bedford Place (just north of the city).\nThe choice in Bedford Place is rather more varied; ranging from Moroccan and Mexican at the southern end of the road through student style curry houses and a Chinese to some late night kebab and chip shops. In terms of value for money the Pride of India is one of best Indians in the city, but most of the restaurants are good value, if not exactly awe-inspiring taste-wise.\nWalking distance from Bedford Place is the area of town that used to be known as Hungry Hill; Commercial Road where the existence of the Mayflower Theatre has meant a thriving trade for various restaurants in pre- and post-theatre eating. Again the choice is varied although generally the quality to cost ratio is not as high as it might otherwise be; although Buon Gusto (Italian) and Cafe Pattaya (Thai) are particularly recommended.\n\n\nBudget\nThere is the usual range of fast food chains spread throughout the city. In the city centre you find the chain restaurants of Tortilla, Greggs (bakery), Franco Manca and the IKEA restaurant. \nFormerly Burger King and McDonalds faced each other across the Bargate like petulant children with the gate acting like a peace-making mother, but McDonalds gave up the fight and fled to the Westquay shopping centre in which you can also find a large selection of 'sit-down' restaurants like Pizza Hut, Nando's, Pizza Express, Yo Sushi!, Wagamama and Cafe Rouge.\nFurthermore, there are many takeaways in Southampton that do delivery and allow you to pick up the food yourself. Typical meals range from \u00a37-15. Check with your hotel/hostel if they allow food orders.\n\n1 Mike's Fish & Chips, 23 Queensway. (updated Feb 2023)\n2 Punjabi Takeaway, 49 St Mary's Rd.

Indian (updated Feb 2023)\n12 La Regata, Town Quay. If you are looking for sea-side eating with a touch of history. Spanish tapas restaurant in a Georgian-style building directly adjoined to the 14th-century walls, is a good choice and has views overlooking the historic Harbour House, the ferry terminal and Hythe. (updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nSplurge\nOxford Street has a selection of higher class (and therefore more expensive) restaurants.\n\n13 White Star, 28 Oxford St, SO14 3DJ. English/traditional (updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nDrink\nAs is to be expected of a large port with two universities, there are a lot of places to drink in Southampton. The city centre features two pubs dating from Tudor times, the Red Lion in High Street in particular is steeped in history.\nPortswood is the drinking area of choice for students at the university, so keep away from places like The Hobbit, 1 Clowns and Jesters (\"Jesters\"), 2 The Gordon Arms and \n3 The Mitre if you want to avoid students. While The \n4 Hobbit.    can be studenty, it is definitely worth a look as it is a quirky pub with a massive beer garden and live music every night of the week. The Shooting Star (previously known as Kolebka) is a relaxed jazz bar with live music every Friday night. Further up on Porstwood Road, The Brook is a dedicated venue for bands.\nThe Polygon (also referred to as \"Bedford Place\") is where most of the clubs and bars in the city lie, such as 5 \"Orange Rooms\" (a club/bar with a wider variety of music) and 6 \"Pop World\" (a retro-themed nightclub).\nThe Marina area has a good (albeit expensive) selection of seafront bars.\nThe 7 Red Lion, 55 High St, SO14 2NS (in High Street), \u260f +44 23 8033-3595. dates back to Tudor times and is a must-see. It's usually fairly quiet as well.   (updated Jul 2023)\nFor those looking for something more lively, The 8 Platform Tavern nearby on the waterfront is an excellent bet as it features live jazz and blues music and a superb selection of local real ales.\n9 The Angel, next to one of the central parks, is an excellent 'local' type pub in the city centre featuring a free drinks quiz and friendly landlord.\nThe city centre also has the usual spattering of chain pubs, including 10 Slug & Lettuce and four Wetherspoon's. For those looking for a more alternative atmosphere, there is also 11 The Firehouse Nightclub, with cheap drinks, friendly staff and customers with a varied spectrum of music from metal/industrial, indie and general rock music.\nOutside of the city centre are the usual local pubs, some of which are excellent and others which are best avoided. The 12 Park Inn in Shirley and the 13 Wellington Arms and 14 Waterloo Arms in Freemantle all have an excellent range of real ales. Nearby and next to St Denys railway station are two more excellent pubs, the 15 Junction Inn and 16 South Western Arms. The 17 Rockstone in Bevois Valley is brilliant: it has a great selection of beers, whiskys and rums, and the selection of food is vast, including plenty of vegan options, ever-changing and of impeccable quality.\n\n18 The Bookshop Alehouse, 21 Portswood Rd, SO17 2ES. One of a number of micropubs in Southampton. Formerly a bookshop, a full bookshelf remains from its previous existence, tba is small and friendly. The beers are changed regularly. Apart from bar snacks there is no food available, however customers can bring in their own food from a nearby takeaway. Staff will most likely give you a napkin and possibly cutlery. St Denys train station is a short walk away and buses to the city centre go right by this pub. There are several bike stands outside too. (updated Sep 2018)\n19 Muse Coffee Co., 14 Broadway, Portswood Road, SO17 2WE, portswood@musecoffeeco.co.uk. 7AM-7PM. Sells sandwiches, patisseries and cakes. They do not sell alcohol. (updated Apr 2021)\n\n\nSleep\nThe Hilton Southampton provides 4-star luxury in a pleasant environment, you can expect comfortable and stylish guestrooms.\n3-star hotels are much easier to come by, the 1 Leonardo Hotel sits in the middle of a city centre roundabout, the 2 Novotel, 3 Travelodge, Holiday Inn and 4 Hotel Ibis are all perfectly adequate for providing a night's sleep.\nIf you feel the need for a less generic hotel experience, 5 The Dolphin Mercure hotel and 6 The Star are both on the High Street in traditional coaching inn buildings and will make you feel less like you're just a commodity.\nIf you're on the cheap, or feel like a more personal stay, then there are plenty of bed and breakfasts; most cluster around the bottom end of Hill Lane which is close to the train station. Wander out from the station's main exit (if you see Toys 'R' Us opposite you're on the wrong exit) and take the path by the left side of the HSBC office block. Hill Lane leads up the small hill from the traffic lights. Keep going up the hill until you find one worth staying at; don't forget to check the side streets too.\nTourist Information will almost certainly be able to find you somewhere to stay if you're stuck (\u260f +44 23 8083-3333).\n\n7 DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Southampton, Bracken Place, Chilworth, SO16 3RB, \u260f +44 2380 702700, reservations.southampton@hilton.com. 24-hour service.

B&B double \u00a3100. (updated Jul 2020)\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nStay safe\nLevels of crime in Southampton are fairly similar to other UK cities; serious crimes are uncommon, but alcohol-related crimes and muggings can happen. There is a strong police presence in the city centre at night time, especially around the clubs and pubs. A night bus service is available to allow people to get home safely. Pollution levels can get rather high particularly when one of the larger cruise ships is in harbor.\n\n\nCope\n3 Samaritans, 11 College Place, London Road, SO15 2FE, \u260f 0845 7 90 90 90 (extra charge number).
