It offers a great diversity of climates and landscapes from jungles in the north, great grass plains in the center and frozen mountains in the south.\nWith a history of mass immigration dating from the 1800s, Argentina is a \"melting pot\" of cultures from around the world. \n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Buenos Aires \u2014 the capital at the shores of the R\u00edo de la Plata, occasionally called Capital Federal to distinguish it from the province of Buenos Aires\n2 C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 second largest city, in the heart of the Pampas region, known for its university and near a beautiful mountain range\n3 La Plata \u2014 the capital of Buenos Aires province, known as \"the perfect city\" for its tracing; just look at a map of the street pattern of the city\n4 Mendoza \u2014 well known for its extensive and high quality wine production.

The highest and the lowest points of South America are also in Argentina: At 6,960 m, Cerro Aconcagua is the tallest mountain in the Americas while Laguna del Carb\u00f3n, at 105 m below sea level, in Santa Cruz Province is the lowest point in South America.\nAt the southern tip of Argentina there are several routes between the South Atlantic and the South Pacific Oceans including the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle Channel, and the Drake Passage \u2013 as alternatives to sailing around Cape Horn in the open ocean between South America and Antarctica.\nThe name Argentina derives from argentinos, the Ancient Greek diminutive (tinos) form for silver (argentos), which is what early Spanish explorers sought when they reached the region in the 16th century.\n\n\nClimate\nBuenos Aires and the Pampas are temperate; cold in the winter, hot and humid in the summer.\nThe deserts of Cuyo, which can reach temperatures of 45\u00b0C, are extremely hot and dry in the summer and moderately cold and dry in the winter. Spring and fall often exhibit rapid temperature reversals; several days of extremely hot weather may be followed by several days of cold weather, then back to extremely hot.\nThe Andes are cool in the summer and very cold in the winter, varying according to altitude.\nNorthwest Argentina's climate varies by altitude with lowland areas experiencing hot summers and mild winters while icy conditions prevail at the highest altitudes. Salta and San Salvador de Jujuy are in valleys and are characterized by a pleasant climate year-round.\nMesopotamia to the northeast has a humid climate with abundant rainfall year-round and high temperatures.\nPatagonia is cool (in the south and the west) to warm (in the center and north-east) in the summer and cold in the winter. Much of the region is a desert except in the extreme west where rainfall is higher, supporting forests. The rainfall changes a lot within a small distance ranging from more than 1,000 mm (39 in) to just under 200 (8 in) less than 100 km (62 mi) away to the east. One defining characteristic of the climate is the strong, persistent winds that blow across the region, making the temperature feel much colder than it is. Extreme temperature shifts within a single day are common here; pack a variety of clothes and dress in layers.\n\n\nTerrain\nThe central region of Argentina is the rich plain known as La Pampa. There is jungle in the extreme northeast and some valleys in the Northwest. The southern half of Argentina is dominated by the flat to rolling plateau of Patagonia. The western border with Chile is along the rugged Andes mountains, including the Aconcagua, the highest mountain outside the Himalayas. The western Cuyo regions at the base of the Andes are mostly rocky desert with some poisonous frock trees.\n\n\nGeography\nArgentina covers an area of 2,796,427 square kilometres (1,079,707 sq mi), making it the world's eighth-largest country, the second-largest country in South America, and the fourth-largest country in the Americas. \nArgentina is slightly larger than Kazakhstan, and is nearly 17 times larger than South America's smallest country, Suriname.\n\n\nHistory\n\nFollowing independence from Spain in 1816, Argentina experienced periods of internal political conflict between conservatives and liberals. In the first decade of the 20th century, Argentina became the richest nation in Latin America, its wealth symbolized by the opulence of its capital city. During the roaring twenties, Argentina was one of the world's richest countries, with a GDP higher than that of major European economies such as France, Germany and Italy. European immigrants flowed into Argentina, particularly from the northern parts of Italy and Spain; by 1914 nearly 6 million people had come to the country.\nAfter World War II, Juan Per\u00f3n came to power and instituted a form of populism commonly known as Peronism. Under Peron, Argentina instituted a protectionist economic policy that heavily restricted foreign trade. While such policies led to the overwhelming popularity of Peron and other Peronist politicians among the masses of working-class Argentinians, they also led Argentina's economy to stagnate. Peron was overthrown in a U.S.-backed military coup in 1976.\nAfter waging an unsuccessful war with the United Kingdom over the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) in 1982, the military leadership lost power and democracy returned in 1983.\nA painful economic crisis at the turn of the 21st century devalued the Argentine peso by a factor of three and ushered in a series of weak, short-lived governments along with social and economic instability. However, later in the decade Argentina seemed to find some new stability, and has a much better economic outlook albeit with the eternal problem of high inflation. Argentina is the third largest economy in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico, and a member of the G20 group of major economies.\nWidespread discontent amid a hyperinflation crisis led to the election of anarcho-capitalist candidate Javier Milei as president in 2023. Milei has pledged to drastically downsize the government and cut welfare programs in order to rein in government spending, while also privatising all the state-owned businesses en masse. He has also pledged to abolish the Argentine Central Bank and Argentine peso, and instead adopt the U.S. dollar as Argentina's national currency. Milei has also pivoted Argentina's foreign policy away from China towards the United States and Israel, and converted to Judaism to show his support for the Zionist cause. Whether or not this can rein in inflation and improve the lives of average Argentines remains to be seen.\n\n\nCultural diversity\n\nBetween 1850 and 1930, the country received millions of immigrants from all over the world. 98% of the population is of partial or full European ancestry.\nItalians are the largest ethnic group in the country, with 60% of Argentines (30 million people) claiming Italian ancestry. Italian influence in the country is profound and well documented; Argentine cuisine has been strongly influenced by Italian cuisine, Italian settlements helped to form the backbone of Argentine society, the Argentinian dialect of Spanish exhibits strong Italian influences, and many Argentines are Italophiles.\nDuring the 1800s, hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the British Isles moved to Argentina. English immigrants are credited with introducing the sport of football to Argentina, which has since become the country's national sport, and there are several Welsh-speaking towns in Chubut province. \nArgentina has one of the world's largest Jewish populations and houses the largest Jewish community in South America, most of whom are of Ashkenazi extraction.\nOther significant ethnic groups:\n\nSpaniards \u2014 the second largest ethnic group and they have been in the country since the 16th century.\nGermans \u2014 it is believed that 8% of Argentines are of German descent.\nThe French \u2014 it is believed that 17% of Argentines are of French descent.\nRussians \u2014 it is believed that 1-3% of Argentines are of Russian descent.\nUkrainians \u2014 they make up 9% of the population in Misiones.\nPoles \u2014 it is believed that 3% of Argentines are of Polish descent.\n\n\nElectricity\nArgentine electricity is 220 V, 50 Hz. Adapters and transformers for North American equipment are readily available.\nThe best way to use imported electrical equipment in Argentina is to purchase an adapter once there. These are available in the Florida shopping area in Buenos Aires for around US$2 or less in hardware stores outside the city center. Buildings use a mix of European and Australian plug fittings. The Australian-style plugs are IRAM-2073, which are physically identical to the Australian AS-3112 standard (two blades in a V-shape, with or without a third blade for ground). However, the live and neutral pins in the Australian fittings are reversed. Therefore, Australian equipment may be incompatible despite the apparent plug-compatibility. This is not a problem for battery chargers for devices like laptops and mobile phones.\nEuropean standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\" outlets and the non-grounded, but compatible, European CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" outlets may still be found in some older buildings. US and Canadian travellers may want to pack adapters for these outlets as well.\nMany sockets have no earth pin. Laptop adapters should have little problem with this. If your laptop adapter requires an earth pin you will need a plug adapter that takes three pins from the laptop and requires only two from the wall socket. This does work but may reduce electrical safety or affect your warranty.\nSome Argentine sockets accept North American plugs, particularly ones on power strips. This does not mean that these sockets supply 110 volts. Make sure that your equipment can handle 220 volts. Simply changing the shape of the plug with a US$2 adapter will not allow 110 V equipment to operate on 220 V Argentinian voltage, unless the device is specifically designed to work on both 110 and 220 volts, irreparable damage and even fire can result. Most laptop power adapters and many portable electronics chargers are designed to work on either voltage; check the specifications for your equipment to be sure. If your equipment cannot accept 220 V voltage, you can purchase a '220-110 V' transformer for approximately US$6 in most Argentinian electronics shops. This is much heavier and bulkier than a small adapter. There are two types of these transformers. One supports heavy loads for short durations, for example a hair dryer. The other supports light loads for long durations, for example an inkjet printer.\n\n\nHolidays\nJanuary 1 \u2014 New Year's Day\nMarch 24 \u2014 Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice\n2 April \u2014 Malvinas Day\n25 May \u2014 Day of the First National Government\nJune 17 \u2014 Anniversary of the death of Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes\nJune 20 \u2014 National Flag Day\nJuly 9 \u2014 Independence Day\nAugust 17 \u2014 Anniversary of the death of Jos\u00e9 de San Martin\nOctober 12 \u2014 Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity\nNovember 20 \u2014 Day of National Sovereignty\nDecember 25 \u2014 Christmas\nDecember 31 \u2014 New Year's Eve\n\n\nVisitor information\nargentina.travel (official tourism website)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nVisas\n\nPassport holders of the following countries do not need a visa to enter Argentina when the purpose of the visit is tourism for up to 90 days (unless otherwise noted): Andorra, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica (30 days), Japan, Kazakhstan (30 days), Republic of Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia (30 days), Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela.\nCitizens and residents (if their nationality is mentioned under visa exemptions applicable to normal passport holders) of the following countries can enter with their National ID card: Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.\nCitizens of India and China (including Macau) who also hold a valid visa issued by the United States or a Schengen visa can obtain an Electronic Travel Authorization (AVE) at a cost of US$50 prior to travelling to Argentina. The validity of Schengen or U.S. visas must be more than 3 months. The processing time is 10 business days.\n\n\nAt arrival\nYou may bring in goods worth US$300 without paying duties.\nIf you are just changing planes at the same airport and not entering the country you will still be given a customs form to fill in but as of May 2014 nobody asks for it at the airport and you can keep it as a souvenir.\n\n\nBy plane\nAerol\u00edneas Argentinas and LATAM offer connections between Buenos Aires' international airport Ezeiza and many cities throughout South America, as well as North America, Europe and Australia. Air New Zealand flies direct from Auckland. Qantas no longer offers direct flights from Sydney to Buenos Aires, instead flying to Santiago, home of its OneWorld Partner LATAM, where people can connect onto multiple destinations in Argentina.\nThere are international flights to other airports, such as to Mendoza with LATAM from Santiago Chile.\nOn flights to and from Argentina the cabin is sprayed with insecticide before the security demonstration before takeoff (flight attendants walk down the aisles with spray cans). This is also done on flights in some other parts of the world where tropical diseases are prevalent like between Singapore and Sri Lanka.\nIf you're flying in or out of Argentina, Buenos Aires is the most common point of arrival and departure. The city has two airports, Ministro Pistarini International Airport (EZE IATA) some 40 km southwest of central Buenos Aires and the more centrally located Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (AEP IATA). The former is for intercontinental flights and a few domestic ones (mostly to R\u00edo Gallegos and Ushuaia), which leave early in the morning but if you're continuing to another location in Argentina or to nearby international destinations (one flight hour away or so) by plane you'll in most cases have to travel from Ezeiza to Jorge Newbery. There are cheap shuttle buses which take you there in about an hour, but travel time varies greatly depending on traffic. Also, there are some flights to Jorge Newbery from three other important South American hubs, namely S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Santiago so if you have a changed planes at those airports, your connecting flight might arrive at (or leave from) Jorge Newbery. Take an extra look at your ticket and ensure you are at the right airport.\nYou should be able to ride a motorcoach or hire a service taxi from one of the booths after you clear customs. The rate for a taxi from Ezeiza international airport to Buenos Aires is AR$130, the rate from the Jorge Newbery domestic airport to town is AR$40 (Mar 2012). You can now also ride an Uber from Ezeiza, the fare is sometimes dynamic and much lower than a taxi, and is recommended to send an SMS or call your driver, since they may need to coordinate the pick up spot with you.\nIf visiting another city there are a number of airports throughout the country. Many find it far easier to travel to a neighboring country and then take a short distance hop to the smaller airport. All major cities in Argentina and major tourist destinations like Mendoza, Perito Moreno and Iguazu Falls have airports nearby. There are several national airlines, with different levels of service. In general flying gets you everywhere quickly and cheaply (relatively). Although the buses in Argentina are among the most comfortable in the world and are reasonably priced, travelling takes a lot of time because of the distances and slow road travel involved.\nPassengers leaving Ezeiza Airport no longer have to pay the \"departure tax\" of US$29 (US$8 to Uruguay and domestic flights) after check-in, as they are now included in the prices of the tickets.\n\n\nBy train\nThere are no long-distance international services to Argentina, only a short-distance train from Encarnaci\u00f3n (Paraguay) to Posadas. Coming from Bolivia, the border towns of Villaz\u00f3n and Yacuiba can be reached by train. A connection between Chile and Argentina is under construction.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nInternational coaches run from all the neighbouring countries.\n\nRetiro Bus Terminal: +54 11 4310-0700\nThe Retiro bus terminal is large and hidden behind Retiro train and Subte stations. For long-distance buses it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance of your trip. Arrive at least 45 minutes before your departure and always ask at an information desk if your gate number is the same as the one printed on your ticket. You will be given a range of possible gate numbers (for example 17-27). Watch your belongings carefully at Retiro as it is often crowded and there have been reports of thefts and even muggings at night. Travelling by bus is one thing you won't regret. You will come across the best customer service and world class seats. Comparing Argentinian coach buses to those in the United States would be insulting to Argentina, for they have much higher standards than those like Greyhound.\n\n\nBy boat\nRegular catamarans routes link Buenos Aires with Montevideo and Colonia in Uruguay.\nThe Buquebus ferry service operates between Buenos Aires, Argentina, and both Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo, Uruguay. Some services are even from Punta del Este (via bus). For the Buquebus-Ferry between Buenos Aires and Colonia del Sacramento there are two options, one takes three hours and the other one hour to get there. Generally, Buquebus seems a little more expensive than Colonia Express.\nColonia Express operates between Buenos Aires and Colonia by one hour ferry. In addition, you can add a bus option between Colonia and Montevideo. Ticket prices from/to Montevideo or Colonia are between US$25\u201350, depending on the day of week and time.\nSeacat Colonia also operates between Buenos Aires and Colonia by one hour ferry, also offering a combined bus option between Colonia and Montevideo or even Punta del Este.\nThere is also the directferries.com/.co.uk website, which offers those trips and ferries, although at inflated prices. In addition, it sometimes requires you to book business seats, which adds even further cost. In the end prices can easily be threefold for a simple one way ticket.\nFurthermore, there are two companies (Cacciola and L\u00edneas Delta) that link the city of Tigre with Carmelo and Nueva Palmira in Uruguay, respectively. Trains to Tigre depart from Retiro (one of Buenos Aires' main train stations) every ten minutes. The trip costs AR$1.1 and takes 50 min.\nTo a lesser extent, Grimaldi Freighters run freighters which carry up to 12 passengers from Hamburg, London, Antwerp, Le Havre, and Bilbao to Montevideo (Uruguay) every 9 days. They also carry cars and you drive your car on and off \u2014 unlike other freighter services. More information can be found on the website.\n\n\nBy car\nArgentina has many border crossings with its neighbouring countries Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil, which are easy to use.\nSome ferries between Buenos Aires and Colonia also carry vehicles. However, taking the land border crossing can be convenient for a more complete route including Salto, Paysand\u00fa and Carmelo and the cities on the Argentinian side on your trip between Argentina and Uruguay.\n\n\nGet around\n\nArgentina is a colossal country. With a land area of 2,780,400 square kilometres (1,073,500 sq mi), travelling from one region to another can take a lot of time.\n\n\nBy bus\nArgentina boasts an outstanding short and long-distance bus network. Since regional train service is limited and plane tickets are more expensive, bus travel is the most common way to travel from city to city within Argentina. It is not as cheap as it was before, with about US$4-5 for each hour of travelling (Puerto Iguaz\u00fa to Buenos Aires about US$100).\nIn Buenos Aires, a city bus is called a colectivo or bondi while a long distance, intercity bus is called a micro or omnibus; this is not always true though, usage varies somewhat in provincial areas.. The hub of this network is definitely Buenos Aires' Terminal de Omnibus de Retiro; it has up to 2,000 bus arrivals and departures per day, and multiple companies serve most destinations. Buses arrive and depart from a total of 75 platforms, and in order to buy your ticket you will have to choose between about 200 ticket booths situated on the upper level of the terminal.\nThe more expensive buses generally offer high-quality service, and for distances longer than 200 km, it is common to have food served on board. There is generally a good amount of legroom, and many buses have seats that recline horizontally into beds (called camas) making them a lot like travelling business class on a plane. The best category with completely reclining seats is normally called cama suite, but other names such as tutto leto, ejecutivo , cama vip or salon real are also in use. Somewhat cheaper seats only recline partially (semi-camas), or not at all (servicio com\u00fan). Every service belongs to one of five official comfort classes with minimum requirements that are prescribed by law in order to facilitate comparisons. The better buses will provide everything you need, while for the lower categories it may be a good idea to take drinks and food with you, as well as toilet paper and ear plugs. If the trip is really long e.g. more than 12 hours it's definitely better to spend a few more bucks and pay for a better bus service. If travelling with a large bag or suitcase bring a handful of coins to tip the porter that heaves your pack in and out of the taxi and bus.\nRemember that, although buses usually arrive at their destination a little late, they almost always leave on time. Do not think that the relaxed approach carries over to bus departure times!\nMore information on bus schedules and fares is available on the webpages of the online ticket resellers Plataforma 10, Central de Pasajes. To buy tickets and to really have a choice to different bus companies you may visit Ticket Online or VoyEnBus . For buses departing or arriving in Buenos Aires, you can consult the webpages of the Terminal Retiro in Buenos Aires. A second bus terminal in Buenos Aires is situated in the Liniers neighbourhood, but it is smaller and less accessible than the one in Retiro. Major bus companies are Andesmar, Flecha Bus and Expreso Singer.\nFor city buses in Buenos Aires you should check BA C\u00f3mo Llego (In English, also an app for smartphones) and Omnilineas (in English).\n\n\nBy train\n\nThe history of rail transport in Argentina is one of many ups and downs. While in the 19th century the rail network rivaled that of the US or many European countries in density, speed and quality as befitted a nation among the richest in the world, the declining fortunes of Argentina in the 20th century hit the railway, too. The railways were nationalized during Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n's first term and remained state-owned until they were privatized under the government of Carlos Menem. However, the railways have since made yet another U-turn and a new state-owned railway was created in 2015. The government has promoted the re-establishment of long-distance passenger trains, although most lines still operate at a low frequency (one or two departures weekly). The rail network is very limited, and intercity buses offer better service and faster rides. Train fares are very cheap, often only a quarter of the bus fare. The website is a bit hard to navigate and Spanish only.\nLocal travel in the Buenos Aires province is by bus and by local trains, with fast trains being the quickest way to get through the city's traffic. The three largest train terminals in Buenos Aires are Retiro, Constitucion and Once. Retiro is a group of three train stations alongside each other with the main long-distance bus (or \"micro\") terminal behind the furthest of the train terminals (from the city center).\nOne of the major long distance train operators is Trenes Argentinos, which departs from Retiro (Buenos Aires) to Rosario, C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n, and from Constituci\u00f3n (Buenos Aires) to Bah\u00eda Blanca. See also Sat\u00e9lite Ferroviario for up-to-date information on trains and services (in Spanish). Tickets can be bought online with a 5% discount and with credit card. Even though, it does not allow for the selection of a foreign passport ID when buying a ticket, you can enter your number (and letters) under DNI, which will be accepted in the train. For getting the needed online account, you cannot enter letters for your ID number, but just put anything, since you will be asked anew for each purchased connection.\nAn amazing (but quite expensive) train ride is the Tren a las nubes (Train to the Clouds) in the northwestern province of Salta, but some people may get altitude sickness. This service, which has experienced suspensions, recommenced in August 2008. The train line no longer crosses the border into Chile.\n\n\nBy plane\nDomestic flights are available within Argentina, but tickets are pricey, and most domestic flights pass through Buenos Aires' domestic airport Aeroparque Jorge Newbery. The main carriers are Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, Aerol\u00edneas Austral (a subsidiary of Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas) and LATAM Argentina. Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas' subsidiary Austral, shares its parent's fleet, and tickets for both can be booked at the same office. The prices for tickets are double for non-residents, so be careful with publicized ticket prices.\nAn exception to passing through Buenos Aires for domestic flights is Aerolineas Argentinas' \"Great Circle Route\", going both ways Saturdays, Tuesdays and Thursdays BA-Bariloche-Mendoza-Salta-Iguazu-BA (and reverse on another flight both days).\nIf you fly on your international trip to Argentina with Aerol\u00edneas you sometimes can get discounts on domestic flights. Sometimes you even get free flights with your international ticket but keep in mind that you probably already paid for this with the inflated price of your international ticket.\nAlways plan to arrive at your final destination before your flight home 2 or 3 days in advance, as Argentina, like most Latin American countries, experiences more delays and cancellations in travel than most areas of the world.\nAdditional smaller carriers offering domestic flights are:\n\n Andes L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas, toll-free: 0810 777-2633 (in country only). Began in 2006 with regular flights between Buenos Aires and Salta. Since then they now serve several major cities in Argentina. (updated Apr 2018)\n Avianca Argentina. Connects Buenos Aires to Rosario, Mar del Plata and Santa Fe in ATR 72 aircraft. Plans are underway to expand service to additional cities. (updated Apr 2018)\n Fly Bondi. (updated Aug 2018)\n L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas del Estado (LADE), \u260f +54 11 5353-2387, toll-free: 0810 810-5233 (in country only). State owned airline, operated by the Air Force, serving Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires Province and Entre Rios in the north and Chubut, Rio Negro, Santa Cruz and Tierra Fuego provinces in Patagonia with Saab 340B aircraft. (updated Apr 2018)\n Norwegian Argentina. Subsidiary brand of Norway's Norwegian Air Shuttle to provide domestic flights from Buenos Aires and Cordoba to Mendoza, Puerto Iguaz\u00fa, Neuqu\u00e9n, Salta and San Carlos Bariloche. Plans are underway to include international flights to Singapore via Perth from Buenos Aires and to include additional domestic and international connections out of Buenos Aires. (updated Oct 2018)\n\n\nBy car\n\nMain article: Driving in Argentina\nTravelling by car allows you to visit locations that are hard to reach by public transportation. Patagonia, in the South of Argentina, is a popular driving location among tourists due to the breathtaking views across many miles of open land.\nArgentina generally recognizes valid drivers' licences from foreign jurisdictions. Drivers must be over 21. Car rental is readily available throughout Argentina, though it is a bit expensive compared with other forms of transportation.\nTraffic regulations in Argentina are generally the same as in Europe and the U.S., but the locals often ignore the regulations. On roads and highways it's mandatory to have car lights on, even during daytime.\nHighways are limited to the areas around large cities. Most of the country is connected by paved unlit two-lane roads (rutas) shared by buses, cars, and large trucks. Some places are accessible only by gravel or dirt roads. Indeed, some main roads in southern Argentina are unsealed, leading to 4x4 vehicles being more popular. This is particularly the case in the south. It is important to travel with a good map, and to be well informed about your route distances, road conditions and the estimated travel time.\nIn many small towns, particularly in the north, they may ration gasoline to ensure they have enough to sell until the next refuelling truck arrives. It's advisable to fill your tank at regular intervals when the opportunity arises.\n\n\nBy thumb\nThe hitchhiking club Autostop Argentina began in Argentina in 2002, inspired by clubs in France, Germany, Italy and the United States. As a result, hitchhiking has become more acceptable among the younger generation, and raising a thumb at a highway is a symbol most people understand.\nHitchhiking in addition is a great and inexpensive way to get to know the real Argentina and its people. If you do get a ride, you will in general be treated with much generosity: Argentinians are very friendly and interested. Due to the lack of budget accommodation in remote regions and even larger cities off the touristy routes, as well as because of the large distances, it is advisable to carry a tent with you. There are many opportunities along the main highways to put it up\u2014sometimes a little search is necessary. This way you can discover Argentina (at least its south) even with the most limited budget: \u20ac300 for 4-5 weeks is possible and still see the interesting and picturesque sights.\nEverything south and including the La Pampa Province is comfortable and easy to hitchhike. Only infrequent traffic (through the center), other hitchhikers (near El Chalten, El Calafate and especially El Bols\u00f3n) or bad weather might set you back. Hence, always have a backup plan (bus, tent, hike, etc.) and simply stay confident. You might in addition take a route which might seem longer, but is in the end much faster, i.e. Ruta 3 is very easy due to the high traffic and few competitors, but Ruta 40 has far less traffic, more competitors and is generally slower due to its conditions. Either way, many helpful tips can also be found in the hitchhiking guide of Wikivoyage.\nNevertheless, near Buenos Aires, Mendoza and Cordoba it is considerably more difficult to hitchhike, and the thumb of a woman is significantly more successful than the thumb of a man. A single man should count on long hours of waiting or simply luck in these regions. Just try it once or twice to find out whether it is possible where you are. Nevertheless, even though as woman it might be more successful, be cautious and vary especially as a solo woman: and never fall asleep and remain on the main roads.\n\n\nOn foot and navigation\nArgentina is an excellent place for hiking and trekking, both in the western Andes, southern Tierra del Fuego and the wide Patagonia, providing many interesting trails. However, due to the often remote nature of these trails, it is important that you are well prepared and have a proper and reliable map with you. In addition, using GPS navigation adds an extra layer of safety, both in cities as well as the countryside. For reliable (offline) maps and comprehensive trails and map information, consult OpenStreetMap, which is also used by this travel guide, and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz. Or just download the according GPX or KML files through Waymarked Trails for such trails on OpenStreetMap. (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID to download the GPX or KML files through the same link.)\n\n\nTalk\n\nThe official language is Spanish. Generally, most people speak Spanish using a local dialect, Castellano Rioplatense, which is subtly different from both the language of Spain and that of Central America. Most notably, the pronoun \"t\u00fa\" is replaced by \"vos\", and the you plural pronoun \"vosotros\" replaced with \"ustedes\", the latter being common throughout Latin America.\nPeople from each city pronounce words differently as well. People from Buenos Aires speak differently compared to those from Spain and other Spanish speaking countries; example: chicken in Spanish (pollo) is pronounced PO-zhO or PO-SHO by the \"Porte\u00f1os\" (residents of Buenos Aires), with the SH sound harder than in Spanish; unlike most other Spanish speakers of South America who pronounces it PO-yo. All Argentinians learn standard Castilian Spanish in school.\nRioplatense Spanish is also heavily influenced by Italian, even frequently being mistaken for it, a result of the large influx of Italian immigrants. Hand gestures derived from Italy are extremely common, and many colloquialisms are borrowed from Italian (for example: instead of saying \"cerveza\", which means beer, youngsters find \"birra\" cooler, which is in Italian). Most locals can readily understand most Spanish dialects, as well as Portuguese or Italian (especially due to its similarity to the local Spanish).\nEnglish is mandatory in high school and usually understood in at least a basic level in tourist areas. German and French can be understood and to some extent spoken by a few. A few places in Patagonia near Rawson have native Welsh speakers.\n\nThe interjection \"che\" is extremely common and means approximately the same thing as English \"hey!\". It can also be employed as a phrase known to someone you don't remember their names. Ex: \"Esc\u00fachame, Che,....\" Sometimes it is peppered throughout the speech, similar to the English phrase \"yo,\" as in \"What's up, yo?\" Nonetheless, communication will not be a problem for any Spanish speaker.\nArgentines will communicate with each other using lunfardo, a street dialect or slang. It is used together with Spanish by replacing nouns with their synonyms in lunfardo. As opposed to changing the original meaning, it just makes the phrase more colourful. An important aspect of lunfardo is that it is only spoken. For example, one knows the word dinero (money), but may use the word \"guita\" in order to refer to the same things. Lunfardo is composed of about 5,000 words, many of which do not appear in the dictionary.\n\n\nSee\nFor many visitors, Argentina as a country has the same seductive appeal as the tango for which it's famous. Just like that iconic partner dance, Argentina embraces you, constantly moving to the rhythm of the streets and improvising every step of the way.\n\n\nUrban life\nIts large cities all bustle with life. The famous capital, Buenos Aires, is the most visited city in South America and a place like no other. Of course, there's fancy cosmopolitan boutiques, top of the line nightlife and gourmet cuisine. However, it's the classic, unpolished side of the city that makes it a worldwide traveller's magnet. The downtrodden but colourful neighbourhoods where crazy traffic sounds drown out distant accordion tunes, the pleasant street-caf\u00e9s and parillas (steak houses), busy outdoor markets and the lovely old centre with its European colonial architecture. San Telmo is the oldest neighbourhood of the city and a good place to indulge in the city vibe of caf\u00e9s, street artists, tango parlors and antique markets in a colonial surrounding. The atmosphere is perhaps Buenos Aires' biggest attraction, but some of the main sights include Recoleta's cemetery and the Plaza de Mayo. Argentina's other big cities share the energetic buzz of BA, but have a distinct character of their own. Mendoza is a lively yet laid-back town, characterized by broad avenues. It's famous as a wine capital far beyond the borders of Argentina and a perfect starting point for the Argentina Wine Route along the hundreds of wineries in the area. As it's close to the Andes, it's also a good base for winter sports and other outdoor activities. The old university city C\u00f3rdoba is known for its particular musical culture with the cuarteto as its number one music style. The city also boasts some of the best colonial heritage sights in the country. Bariloche, also at the base of the Andes mountains, is a major tourist destination, popular for its skiing opportunities, lovely beaches and chocolate shops.\n\n\nNatural wonders\n\nFascinating as Argentina's urban life may be, the country's mighty natural attractions are at least as good a reason to come. The landscapes are incredibly various, from the high peaks of the Andes and the famous Perito Moreno Glacier to cacti-filled deserts, sandy Atlantic beaches and biodiverse wetlands. With some 30 national parks in the country, there's always a good place nearby to see some of the country's natural wonders. A highlight in the subtropical north are the spectacular Igua\u00e7u Falls, easily one of the most impressive waterfalls on earth. Argentina's wildlife includes \ufb02amingos, penguins, caimans and capybaras, sea lions and -at times- even whales. Especially when you're visiting in autumn, the coastal town of Puerto Madryn is a must. From there you can easily make your way to Punta Tombo and Peninsula Valdes to go whale-watching and meet up close and personal with some of the million penguins who come to Patagonia each year to nest and raise their young. Head to El Calafate to organize your tour to the highly popular Los Glaciares National Park and see the famous glaciers and the icy Argentino Lake. Be amazed by the many colours and remarkable rock formations of Quebrada de Humahuaca, a mountain range in the north that extends far over the Bolivian border. Drive through and spot traditional villages and indigenous women and their goat herds. Other great destinations for nature lovers include the Ibera wetlands (with the most diverse fauna in the country) and Talampaya National Park, a primary site for archaeological and palaeontological finds.\nGenerally, Argentina is a country that charges excessively for its natural wonders and touristy sights, like the one mentioned above. And especially as a foreigner you generally pay twice as much as locals, even though costs of living do not differ much between Argentina and Europe. This can make Argentina an expensive destination and barely interesting for someone on a shoestring. However, there are great alternatives that require little money and are equally interesting, like El Chalten and the Viedma Glacier (the largest in Argentina), El Bols\u00f3n with great hiking options (even into Chile), (Lake) Epecu\u00e9n, Cerro de La Ventana, San Antonio Oeste with the popular Las Grutas beach resort town and the picturesque Playa Las Conchillas and Playa Piedras Coloradas, Pinguinera Cabo Dos Bahias near Puerto Madryn, Bosques Petrificados (de Jaramillo), the colorful hills of the Quebrada de Humahuaca in Jujuy and other impressive rock formations in the Salta Province, and many more. In addition, relying on hitch-hiking and travelling with a tent can bring down costs.\nThe website www.argentina.gob.ar has a list of destinations, Ruta de las Estrellas, that pertains to astrotourism.\n\n\nSome other highlights\nThe countryside in general is a most pleasant part of Argentina; laid-back and with a taste for life close to nature. Rural villages are a breath of fresh air compared to the country's hectic big cities and a nice way to experience traditional culture. The north is as South-American as Argentina gets. Its wine regions are famous throughout the world and an increasingly popular tourist destination. If the bustle of Buenos Aires is too much for your taste, Mendoza and Salta are an excellent choice. They also make for a good base to explore the scenic regional vineyards and friendly villages with the Andes mountains in the background. Salta is also the starting point for the Train to the Clouds, a heritage railway that seems to be running solely to provide some unforgettable panoramas for visitors. The Traslasierra Valley is a pleasant green valley and one of the many places where you can enjoy a world class spa, as hot springs naturally occur around here. Finally, if you like a day at the beach, Argentina has plenty to offer for you. Mar del Plata is one of the top destinations for beach resorts.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nHiking and trekking\nArgentina is a great country to seek out the nature, glaciers, lakes and mountains for a couple of days with a tent, sleeping bag and cooking ware. Many of the above-mentioned sights are spotted with beautiful hiking trails of varying quality and level, like El Chalten, San Carlos de Bariloche, or El Bols\u00f3n\u2014read there for more information on specific trails. Often you will have to climb up a mountain to see a glacier or a lake, just to return later\u2014in that case consider leaving your (heavy) luggage where it cannot be found and enjoy the trail without the burden, but remembering where you left your backpack before.\n\nAlso, see the general Hiking and Wilderness backpacking guidelines of Wikivoyage.\n\n\nWalking tours\nBuenos Aires has a number of walking tour options. They include the typical tours you may find in any city, as well as interesting options including free walking tours, downloadable MP3 walking tours, and even running tours.\n\n\nSports\nThe most popular sport in Argentina is football (soccer), and it is often said that football is not just a sport but a religion. If you come to Argentina, you shouldn't miss the chance to experience a professional match live. Argentina's top professional football league is the Primera Divisi\u00f3n, and the fans are very passionate. The Argentinian national team is also one of the world's footballing powerhouses, having won the FIFA World Cup 3 times (in 1978, 1986 and 2022), and matches against Brazil and England in particular are very charged affairs.\n\n\nFootball teams\nFive teams, all from Buenos Aires and its immediate area, are the historic elite of Argentine football and collectively known as \"Los 5 grandes\".\n\nBoca Juniors \u2013 famous stadium \"La Bombonera\" where Diego Maradona played.\nRiver Plate \u2013 Stadium \"El monumental de Nu\u00f1ez\" where Argentina won the 1978 FIFA World Cup.\nRacing Club \u2013 The first Argentine team to win the Club World Championships.\nIndependiente \u2013 won the most Copa Libertadores\nSan Lorenzo\nOther prominent teams include:\n\nRosario Central \u2013 Stadium: \"El gigante de Arroyito\". Rosario is about 300 km/190 mi by road from Buenos Aires.\nNewell's Old Boys \u2013 Rosario Central's crosstown rival, where Gabriel Batistuta played. Lionel Messi played in its youth program before moving to Spain as a teenager.\nV\u00e9lez Sarsfield (European SouthAmerican Cup Champion in Tokyo 1994). Another Buenos Aires-area club.\nEstudiantes de La Plata \u2013 World Champion '68, Champion of America 1968 - 1969 - 1970 - 2009. Still another club in greater Buenos Aires; Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n played here.\nCol\u00f3n de Santa Fe \u2013 team with the largest number of supporters; based in the city of Santa Fe, about 170 km/100 miles up the Paran\u00e1 River from Rosario\nThe rivalry between the Buenos Aires clubs of Boca Juniors and River Plate, known as El Supercl\u00e1sico , is by far the most intense in Argentina, with rioting and even stabbings between fans of the two clubs being a regular occurrence.\n\n\nOther sports\nRugby and basketball (b\u00e1squet) are also popular. Bah\u00eda Blanca in particular is regarded as the hotbed of Argentine basketball, producing more than its share of the country's top players, most notably Hall of Famer Manu Gin\u00f3bili.\nArgentine polo is famous throughout the world, and the country is home to all of the highest ranked players today. Introduced by British settlers in the 1870s, skillful gauchos adopted it and the passion caught like wildfire. The Argentine Polo Open, usually played on early December every year, is a must for polo fans from all over the world. The sport's governing body is the Asociacion Argentina de polo and its webpage lists all the official tournaments held each year. Argentina is also well known for the many polo clinics held on clubs and farms around Buenos Aires.\nTennis has been growing in popularity with the Argentina's steady production of top players since the 1980s.\nField hockey has also became a popular sport, especially among women. The National Women's Field Hockey Team, Las Leonas (The Lionesses), has grown in the past years and developed into a now competes against the best in the world.\nCar racing is popular too: The main leagues are Turismo Carretera (Ford vs Chevrolet), TC2000 (Touring Cars) and TopRace. The most important racetrack in Argentina is in Buenos Aires is Aut\u00f3dromo Oscar Alfredo G\u00e1lvez.\nGolf in Argentina is an increasingly popular sport thanks in part to the success of Argentinian players such as \u00c1ngel Cabrera, Andr\u00e9s Romero and Eduardo Romero. There are around 280 courses in the country, most around Buenos Aires and including such well-known names as the Jockey Club, Olivos and Hurlingham. On the Atlantic coast in Mar del Plata are a couple of courses that have held international events, and Patagonia has excellent resort courses such as Llao Lloa, Arelauquen and Chapelco (a Nicklaus design), as well as the 9-hole course in Ushuaia.\n\n\nItineraries\nTren de las Sierras\nNational Route 40 (Argentina)\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe official currency of Argentina is the peso (ISO: code: ARS), denoted by the symbol \"$\". It is divided into 100 centavos. Coins come in denominations of 5, 10, 25, 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5 and 10 pesos. Banknotes are issued in values of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 and 20,000 pesos. The most common banknotes in circulation in Argentina are 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 and 20,000 pesos. Be prepared to receive small change in the form of golosinas (candies/sweets), especially in Chinese supermarkets. Because the largest banknote is 20,000 pesos (roughly US$20 as of late 2024), cash payments often involve carrying stacks of banknotes.\nSince 1969 thirteen zeroes have been dropped (a factor of ten trillion), the peso has been revalued again and again, and its name changed. \n\n\nInflation\nIn December 2023, the peso was devalued by 50% against other currencies. Any price information must be treated with a lot of caution and is probably unreliable. Most accommodations post their prices in US dollars online\u2014prepare yourself for discussions on the corresponding price in pesos.\n\n\nBanks\nBanks are generally open from 10:00 to 15:00 and only on weekdays.\n\n\nATMs\nATMs are the most convenient but on the other hand quite expensive source of cash. In general, ATMs in Argentina charge very high additional fee when using a credit card, independently of your credit card conditions at home. ATMs should be used only in banks or ATMs that acted as the banks' branches. Just like in most cities, independent ATMs (not affiliated with any bank) are considered less safe.\nMost ATMs strictly limit withdrawals on foreign cards. Most machines have a withdrawal limit of around AR$10,000 and a fixed fee of AR$600-1000 (Mar 2021). RedBrou ATMs have been good bets.\nSometimes the machines also dispense US dollars for international bank cards that are members of the Cirrus and PLUS networks. Visitors from Brazil can find many Banco Ita\u00fa agencies all over the city.\n\n\nWestern Union\nYou can send yourself cash via Western Union online. Western Union uses a US dollar-to-peso exchange rate that is similar to the MEP (foreign credit card exchange rate). It is a far better rate than the official exchange rate, but not as high as the highest black market rate. On the other hand, with Western Union, you do not have to fear getting counterfeit ARS currency.\nYou will get an email confirmation within a few minutes allowing you to collect your Argentinian pesos at their nearest office or shop. You must set up an account to send yourself money.\n\n\nMoney exchange\nCash exchange rates for US dollars are very competitive, and it may be more advantageous to bring a large sum of US currency, considering the high fees of ATMs. It is easy to stack up US dollars in Uruguay because its ATMs do allow US dollar withdrawals at no or a low fee. However, of course then you will also have to watch this money all the time. So, a mix of both, US dollars and ATM, is probably the best.\nExchange rates at official Bureau de Change in Argentina are very competitive with rates being barely 1% off the official interbank rate. Also, many of the larger banks (like Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina) exchange money at competitive rates, even euros. As of 2019, expect to lose 10-20% when buying Argentenian pesos with Chilean pesos as most banks do not exchange them. The bigger the city the easier it gets to exchange money, even the oddest currencies\u2014see Buenos Aires#Buy. You might need a passport with banks though.\nBlack market currency dealers, called arbolitos (\"little trees\") and operating from cuevas (\"caves\"), can be found yelling \"Cambio\", with Florida Street in Buenos Aires being particularly notorious. At so-called \"blue dollar\" (d\u00f3lar blue) currency exchanges you can get up to AR$330 as of December 2022 (roughly double the official rate). The black market is illegal, so take all possible precautions to avoid getting ripped off, and remember that your money may be confiscated if you are busted by the police.\nHostel owners will sometimes be willing to exchange US dollars. Check the notes received and the current and up-to-date rates.\n\n\nCredit cards\nThe situation for foreign travelers using non-Argentine credit cards changed dramatically at the end of 2022. In short, the Argentine government established a new exchange rate for such transactions, called the \"MEP\" rate. As of December 2022, major international credit cards such as Visa began to process transactions at the new MEP rate. At the end of January, when the black market exchange rate was about 375 ARS/USD, Visa processed transactions at 330 ARS/USD. In addition, foreigners using foreign credit cards at hotels in Argentina are not charged the 21% VAT charged to Argentines.\nCredit cards are used less commonly in Argentina than in the USA or Europe. Many businesses in the city accept them and you can expect any major chain \u2014 supermarkets, fast food, clothing stores, etc. \u2014 to also accept them. The standard 10% tip in restaurant is often expected to be paid in cash, even when you pay the bill by credit card. Bear in mind, tipping is only expected when the establishment does not already charge you for \"cubiertos\" (literally, utensils. In practice it means \"table service\").\nIf you use a debit or credit card, the checkout operator in places like supermarkets will often require you to present both your card and a form of identification such as a drivers' licence. Present both simultaneously at checkout and with confidence. A lack of confidence will lead to a request for your passport as identification. For larger purchases such as long-distance bus tickets you will need to present your passport and your credit card. Although this makes shopping difficult, do try to keep your passport in a location such as a hotel-room safe.\nPIN cards have become the most common ones and should be accepted anywhere, as well as magnetic band cards. PINs should be accepted but if not, the shop attendant will ask you to sign the invoice. Contactless credit cards have begun to be accepted as of 2023.\n\n\nTraveller's checks\nThey are rarely used and may be difficult to exchange, but there is an American Express office at San Martin Plaza in Buenos Aires that will take American Express' Traveller's Checks. Also, Banco Frances will cash them with proper identification.\n\n\nTipping\nThere is no obligation to tip in Argentina although it is considered customary. Some restaurants already charge customers with \"cubiertos\" (table service). In these cases tipping is not expected. Sometimes rounding up or telling them to \"keep the change\" is enough on small checks, deliveries, gasoline tenders, etc. Leaving at least a 10% tip is considered kind and polite at restaurants, cafes, hotels, beauty parlors, barbers, ushers and car-washes. Tipping bartenders is not customary. Leaving no tip when feeling unsatisfied is not an uncommon gesture, and it's interpreted as such. Taxi drivers do not expect to be tipped.\nAnother local custom is to tip the ushers in theatres and opera houses when they're also in charge of handing out the programmes; one may request one without tipping, at the risk of being considered cheap.\nService fees are included in most upscale hotels and restaurants, usually around 15%. These fees can appear in the menu as \"valor del cubierto\", \"servicio\", or simply \"cubierto\". By law it is mandatory that this item is represented in the same text size as the rest of the menu items.\n\n\nShopping\nThe fashion and art scenes are booming. Buenos Aires' signature European-South American style overflows with unique art pieces, art deco furniture, and antiques. Local fashion designers, who are becoming a source of inspiration for the U.S. and European high-end markets, compose their collections based on lots of leather, wools, woven fabrics and delicate laces with a gaucho twist. At times, the exchange rate can present good value for international tourists.\nFashionable clothing and leather products can be found in most commercial areas; jackets, boots and shoes are easily available. However, Buenos Aires has a relatively mild climate, so truly cold-weather gear is harder to find here. Long coats or heavy gloves may not be in stock; similarly, jeans and other basics have a thin construction compared with those in cooler countries. The Andes regions and Patagonia are considerably colder in the winter, so thick clothing is much easier to find here.\nElectronics are not cheap, as they are subject to heavy import tariffs. The price of music, books, and movies lags slightly behind changes in the exchange rate and can offer a bargain if the volatile exchange rates are in your favour.\nMost free-standing shops in Buenos Aires are open 10:00-20:00 on weekdays, and some of them also Saturdays and Sundays, depending on what area of the city they are in. Enclosed malls, however, set their own hours, and are also open on the weekends.\nMost places outside of the city of Buenos Aires, where most stores remain open during a siesta, still observe a siesta from approximately noon until 16:00; almost all businesses are closed during this time. The precise closing hours vary from store to store, according to the preferences of the owner. Shops and offices generally open again in the evening until 21:00 or 22:00.\n\n\nEat\n\nSee also: Argentine cuisine\nArgentinian breakfasts are somewhat light compared to what those from English-speaking countries are accustomed to. Typically, it consists of a hot drink (coffee, tea, milk) with some toast, medialunas (croissants, literally \"halfmoons\") or bread.\nHotels typically provide a free buffet consisting of coffee, tea, drinkable yogurt, assorted pastries and toast, fruit and perhaps cereal. These kinds of breakfasts are also readily available in the many cafes.\nLunch is a big meal in Argentina, typically taken in the early afternoon. Lunch is so big because dinner is not until late: 20:30 to 21:00 at the earliest, more commonly at 22:00 or even later. Most restaurants do not serve food until then except for pastries or small ham-and-cheese toasted sandwiches (tostados), for afternoon tea 18:00-20:00. Tea is the one meal that is rarely skipped. A few caf\u00e9s do offer heartier fare all day long, but don't expect anything more substantial than pizza or a milanesa (breaded meat fillets) or a lomito (steak sandwiches) outside of normal Argentine mealtimes. Dinner is usually eaten at 22:00 and typically consists of appetizers, a main course, and desserts.\nNorth Americans should beware that Argentinians use the term \"entr\u00e9e\" to refer to appetizers. This is common outside of North America but can surprise some Canadians and most Americans. In Argentina the main dish is a \"plato principal\".\nThe appetizers in Argentina typically consist of empanadas (baked pastries with a meat filling), chorizo or morcilla (meat or blood sausage), and assortments of achuras (entrails). For a main dish, there is usually bife de chorizo (sirloin or New York Strip steak) and various types of salads. Dessert is often a custard with dulce de leche and whipped cream topping.\nBeef is a prominent component of the Argentine diet, and Argentine beef is world-famous for good reason. Argentina and Uruguay are the top 2 countries in meat per capita consumption in the world. Definitely check out Argentine barbecue: asado, sometimes also called parrillada, because it is made on a parrilla, or grill. Food in Argentina is virtually synonymous with beef. The beef is some of the best in the world, and there are many different cuts of meat. Lomo (tenderloin) and bife de chorizo are excellent. \"Costillas\" (ribs) is considered by locals the real \"asado\" meat cut and is very tasty. North Americans will see that costillas are different to those at home. Argentinians cut ribs perpendicular to the bone. Having a parrillada dinner is one of the best ways to experience Argentine cuisine; preferably with a bottle of wine and a good amount of salads. In some popular areas, parrilladas are available from small buffets, or street carts and barbecue trailers. Skewers and steak sandwiches can then be purchased to takeaway.\nGiven that a large portion of Argentines are of Italian, Spanish and French descent, such fare is very widespread and of high quality; pizzerias and specialized restaurants are very common. A convention observed in Argentina is to treat the pasta and sauce as separate items, with each charged separately.\nCaf\u00e9s, bakeries, and ice-cream shops (helader\u00edas) are very popular. Inexpensive and high-quality snacks can be found in most commercial areas, and many have outdoor seating areas. Empanadas (turnovers) containing meats, cheeses, or many other fillings can be bought cheaply from restaurants or lunch counters. The Alfajor is a must try snack of a two cookies (biscuits) with a dulce de leche filling and can be purchased at any local kiosco.\nSmoking is now prohibited in all of Buenos Aires' restaurants and all of Mendoza's restaurants. In most cities, it's forbidden in all public buildings (caf\u00e9s, shops, banks, bus stations, etc.), so it's better to ask before smoking anywhere.\nSignature/national dishes\n\nAsado (barbecued meats)\nEmpanada (baked pastries with a meat, cheese and/or vegetable filling)\nMilanesa (breaded meat fillets)\nHumita\nChorizo (sausage) and Choripan (with bread)\nTarta de Jam\u00f3n y Queso (baked pastry crust with ham and cheese filling)\nGuiso Criollo \u2014 with meat, vegetables and fruit\nPizza \u2014 Due to the large number of Italian immigrants, Argentina has its own unique style of pizza.\nDesserts and snacks\n\nDulce de leche\nAlfajores\nHelado\nFlan con Dulce de Leche\nTorta de Ricotta\nFacturas\n\n\nDrink\n\nYerba mate (pronounced in two syllables, 'MAH-teh') is a traditional Argentine herbal drink, prepared in a hollowed-out gourd which is passed around in a social setting and drunk through a metal straw. Although usually drunk hot, mate can also be served cold, usually known as \"terer\u00e9\"; the version that is preferred in Paraguay and Mato Grosso, Brazil. Mate contains less caffeine than coffee, but contains other vitamins and minerals that give it a stimulating effect, particularly to those who are not used to it. It is naturally rather bitter, so it's not uncommon to add sugar, though it's polite to ask before adding sugar to it. The drinking of mate with friends is an important social ritual in Argentina. The informal tea ceremony is led by a \"cebador\" or server and people arrange themselves in a \"rueda\" or wheel.\nArgentina is renowned for its excellent selection of wine. The most popular being Mendoza, whose terrain seems to complement the European grape varietals with interesting notes not present when produced in other climates. The best way to experience and understand the selection of Argentine varietals is one of the many tasting events.\nThe legal drinking age is officially 18, although most establishments will serve anyone approximately 16 or older. Most restaurants serve a broad range of liquors. Beer is offered in drought form in a chopp (small glass) or served in bottles or cans, and is typically a light, easily drinkable lager. The most popular locally made brands of beer are Quilmes, Isenbeck, Schneider and Brahma (although it's Brazilian). Widely-available imports include Warsteiner, Heineken, Budweiser and Corona. There are now many small pubs and bars in Buenos Aires that brew beer on premises, but most of these offer a poor quality product compared to what is widely available in parts of Europe and the USA. In the Buenos Aires area, the Buller Brewing Company in Recoleta and the Antares Brewery in Mar del Plata offer excellent handcrafted English-style ales. Ask if there are \"cervezas artesanales\", locally hand crafted beers.\nFernet is widely consumed by Argentinians, especially in C\u00f3rdoba, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires. It came from Italy, and is a very bitter drink made from herbs, with 40% alcohol and dark brown in colour. Due to its bitter taste, it is usually mixed with Coke (served in bars, pubs, clubs), and if you go to an Argentinian house they will have Fernet and Coke to offer you. Also, Fernet is usually served as a digestif after a meal, but may also be enjoyed with coffee and espresso, or mixed into coffee and espresso drinks. It may be enjoyed at room temperature or with ice.\nCider (sidra) is the typical drink at celebrations, especially at Christmas. On other important occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries or weddings, sidra is the drink chosen for the toast.\nCaf\u00e9s often have fresh-squeezed fruit juices, which is otherwise hard to find.\n\n\nSleep\nA wide range of accommodation possibilities are available in Buenos Aires and the rest of the country, from student hostels to homey bed and breakfasts to trendy boutique hotels in the city to luxurious palaces and modern five-star hotels. There are also many beautiful lake-side lodges in Patagonia, and fabulous regional farms (estancias) outside the cities.\nMany vacation caba\u00f1as (cabins or weekend houses) are available for short-term rent directly from the owners in the mountains, seaside, and in rural areas. Drive around and look for signs saying alquiler (\"rental\"), or check the classified section of any major newspaper.\nArgentina is a vast country and camping is possible at many places (free or including amenities), especially near the beach. In addition, many villages and towns offer inexpensive \"municipal camping\". However, consider that many grounds are private property, so you should not camp here. Consult OpenStreetMap, which many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz use, to find places which have been tagged by other people as possible camping sites.\n\n\nLearn\n\nEducation in Argentina is free for everyone, no matter the level, and it has a good quality. Argentina is a popular destination for University students, especially from neighboring countries (such as Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The most prestigious university of the country and one of the most important universities of Latin America is the University of Buenos Aires. It has excellent undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and are internationally recognised, with exchange programmes with various universities in many countries around the world.\nApart from Buenos Aires, Mendoza is another popular and excellent place to take Spanish lessons for those who want a more idyllic setting (see the entry for Mendoza for details).\nThere are also a lot of public and private quality institutes who give Spanish lessons, and many more for Tango lessons, Argentinean art and literature and architecture.\n\n\nWork\nVolunteering (and learning Spanish at the same time) is big in South America and thus also in Argentina. General information on the South America article.\n\n\nCope\nFacebook has an Argentina & Chile Backpacker / Traveler group where you can find other travellers and up-to-date information on the country. In general, also see South America#Cope.\n\n\nStay safe\nBecause it is well known that tourists bring hard currency to Argentina to avoid the official exchange rate, tourists can be targets of crime. Exercise extra caution here, don't go to Western Union alone, be careful changing on the street, and bring a lock for your bags, take the $1-2 Uber instead of walking at night. The 500 or so dollars you may bring represents 3 months at the minimum wage. Be careful.\nArgentina has a relatively high traffic mortality rate, with about 20 road deaths per day, and with more than 120,000 injured people each year, including tourists. Pedestrians should exercise extreme caution. Do not jaywalk if you do not feel comfortable, and be careful crossing even when allowed.\nThere is plenty of activity and foot traffic throughout the night. Nice areas have a very thorough police presence, perhaps one officer per 3 blocks, plus store security and auxiliary patrols. Public security in all major cities like Buenos Aires, C\u00f3rdoba and Rosario is handled by the Federal Police and the National Gendarmerie or the Naval Prefecture, especially in the Puerto Madero area of Buenos Aires.\nAs in any large city, certain particular neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires and other cities are very dangerous. Some shady neighbourhoods include Retiro, Villa Lugano, La Boca and Villa Riachuelo. Ask trusted locals, such as hotel desk staff or police officers, for advice. Pay attention to your environment and trust your instincts. If an area seems questionable, leave.\nMany people in the street and in the subway hand out small cards with horoscopes, lottery numbers, pictures of saints, or cute drawings on them. If you take the card, the person will ask for payment. You can simply return the card along with a no, gracias. or simply in silence if your Spanish is not good. Persistent beggars are usually not dangerous; a polite but firm no tengo nada (\"I don't have anything\") and/or hand gestures are usually enough.\nMost crimes involve petty theft (pickpockets) in the subway and on crowded city streets, and especially inhabitant from Buenos Aires have a story to tell, which is also why many people carry their bags in front of them. In most cases, if your wallet is stolen, you won't even notice until hours later. However, paying attention to your stuff, will mostly prevent this from happening. Never hang your purse or bag from the back of your chair in a cafe or restaurant\u2014stealthy theft from such bags is common. Keep your purse or backpack on the floor between your legs while you eat. Petty theft is common but seldom, like in a few other European cities like Paris or Naples. Violent robberies are uncommon, and mostly only happen where you would expect them, at night in a lone street in the wrong quarter. In the unlikely event that you are confronted by a mugger, simply hand over your valuables; they are replaceable and the muggers may be on drugs, drunk, have a knife or a gun.\nPopular demonstrations are very common in Buenos Aires, and are best avoided by tourists as these demonstrations sometimes grow into violent confrontations with the police or National Gendarmerie, particularly as they approach the government buildings in the city center.\nSince 2005 the government has cracked down on illegal taxis very successfully. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes or, less commonly, giving counterfeits in change). Taxis that loiter in front of popular tourist destinations like the National Museum are looking for tourists. Stay away from them. Your chance of falling prey to a scam increases in these situations. Stopping a taxi a block or two away on a typical city street where others locals would do the same is good choice. Also having small bills will help you avoid issues mentioned, as well you will often find taxis that don't have change for 100 peso notes.\nCarry some ID with you, but not your original passport; a copy (easily provided by your own hotel) should be enough.\n'Villas' or ghettos, usually composed of wooden or steel plate shacks, should also be avoided due to the high crime rate in these areas. Should you want to visit one of these, you should only do so as part of a guided tour with a reputable guide or tour company.\nDrug use is frowned upon by most inhabitants. Alcohol is generally the vice of choice here. Paco, a crack-like mix of by products from the cocaine manufacturing process, is a serious problem in poor neighbourhoods, and its users should be avoided at all costs.\nIt was reported in 2007 that security workers at airports were stealing electronics, sun glasses and jewellery from checked luggage. This has not been reported since but it is always wise to keep all valuables in carry-on luggage.\nPolice officers will often ask for a bribe during a traffic stop, although it is reported they are not overly pushy.\n\n\nNatural disasters\n\n\nTornadoes\nThe central and northern Argentinian provinces (including La Pampa, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, Entre R\u00edos, C\u00f3rdoba, Corrientes, Misiones, the north of R\u00edo Negro, south of San Lu\u00eds, central and eastern regions of Formosa and southeast of Santiago del Estero and Chaco provinces) are part of the South America Tornado Corridor, the second most tornado-prone area in the world (behind the United States Tornado Alley). Monitor local media notices and if you see that the sky is dark, the light take on a greenish-yellow cast or a loud sound that sounds like a freight train, this could be an indication of a tornado. Find shelter immediately.\nRefer to the tornado safety article for analysis of the issues here.\n\n\nEmergency numbers\nAmbulance (Immediate Health Emergency Service, SAME in Buenos Aires): 107\nFiremen (National Firemen Corps): 100\nPolice (Argentine Federal Police): 911 mostly, might be 101 in some smaller cities\nTourist Police: +54 11 4346-5748 / 0800 999 5000\n\n\nStay healthy\n\nVisiting Argentina doesn't raise any major health worries. Certain vaccinations may be necessary for visitors, depending on what parts of Argentina you plan to visit. Yellow fever vaccinations are recommended for those visiting the Northern forests. If you missed your vaccination at home, it is possible to receive a free yellow fever shot in Argentina, in one of the bigger cities. This can be of advantage if you travel further to other Amazonian countries. However, be prepared to be queue at the very end\u2014first the locals are treated. Also, there are specific days of the week when the vaccination takes place.\nDengue, a mosquito borne illness, is a serious and potentially fatal Iif you get reinfected) illness. Mosquito bites should be prevented at all costs, where they have many bug repellents, from lotions to sprays, as well as citronella candles, and 'espirales' (a spiral shaped incense). These are purchasable at most kiosks (kioskos) or pharmacies.\nDifferent climate conditions might take your body by surprise, so be aware of the weather before you arrive. An upset stomach is the most you're likely to have to worry about as your body adjusts to local micro-organisms in the food.\nIt's also best to ease yourself gently into the local diet \u2013 sudden quantities of red meat, red wine, strong coffee and sweet pastries can be very unsettling for a stomach used to gentler repasts \u2013 and though tap water in Argentina is safe to drink, if sometimes heavily chlorinated, you may prefer to err on the side of caution in rural areas in the north of the country.\nAlthough oral contraceptives are sold over the counter, without a prescription, a woman considering taking them is well advised first to consult a wise and licensed physician about their proper use, as well as possible contraindications and side effects.\nHospitals are free. They won't charge you for any treatment, but it is customary to offer a contribution, if you have the means. In public/state run hospitals, it is now illegal for any hospital employee to receive or even ask for payment. This does not include private health care facilities, or for medicines.\nSun block is recommended. Heat rash, dehydration, and sunburns are common for first time visitors, in particular in the hotter months.\n\n\nRespect\nGenerally speaking, Argentines are expressive and emotive conversationalists.\n\n\nCommunication style\nCompared to other South American nations, Argentines are often seen as more direct and forthright in their communication style. Try not to be offended by the way they speak; in most cases, they rarely intend to make you feel bad or uncomfortable. \nArgentines tend to be very inquisitive and curious; it is common for them to ask people, even those they have just met for the first time, personal questions. If someone asks you personal questions, it is expected that you answer or share in return. Don't be put off by this; Argentines are not trying to interrograte or investigate you. \nArgentines interrupt others and shout while conversing. What may seem like a shouting match in public may actually be a passionate, engaging discussion.\nArgentines, in general, are notorious for their regular use of profanity. Don't be put off by this as people don't intend to make you uncomfortable in any way.\n\n\nGreetings\nCheek kissing is very common in Argentina, especially in bigger cities, among and between women and men. People make contact with right cheeks, and make a light \"kiss sound\" but not touch the cheek with their lips (only once, two kisses -right and then left- is very rare). When two women, or opposite sexes first meet, it is not uncommon to kiss. Two men will first shake hands if they do not know each other, but will probably kiss when departing, especially if they have spoken for a while. Male friends cheek kiss every time when greeting, it is like a sign of trust. Trying to shake hands when offered a kiss will be considered odd, but never rude especially if you are an obvious foreigner.\nIn the rest of the country, regular handshaking applies. Also women will greet by kissing as described above, but it's reserved to other women and to men they are acquainted with.\n\n\nFootball\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in the country and many Argentines are passionate, die-hard fans of the sport. Iconic players like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi, along with successes in FIFA World Cup matches, further fuel their love for the sport. \nWhile discussing the sport may be an icebreaker, be aware that praising or wearing jerseys of rival clubs or national teams (especially Brazil and England) may attract negative attention, rude remarks, or even lead to physical confrontations. To be on the safe side, only wear an Argentine national team jersey and discuss highlights of the Argentine national team.\n\n\nPunctuality\nArgentines have a casual and flexible view of time; the pace of life in Argentina (outside of always-hurried Buenos Aires) is slow, many activities (plays and concerts, for instance) rarely happen as scheduled, and it is normal for Argentines to be late for casual appointments and social events. However, punctuality is expected for business meetings.\nLong-distance Buses and flights usually leave on time, but in local public transportation delays are common, especially in big cities.\n\n\nSensitive issues\nAvoid talking about the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and the dispute about Falklands War, with their English name. Argentines do not refer to the islands as \"Falklands\", but \"Malvinas\". These are very sensitive issues for many Argentines and can trigger a strong reaction and create an uncomfortable situation for you.\nThere is a degree of distrust and resentment towards the United Kingdom, particularly among older Argentines, especially due to the Falklands War. Avoid wearing any English and British symbols due to the above mentioned reasons. English and British flags as well as English national football (soccer) tops (who are rivals of the Argentine national football team during the World Cup) are definitely to be avoided. Although no assaults on people wearing them have been recorded, people might be very upset about them and you are very likely to receive very icy looks and treatment from the population.\nDomestic politics are highly polarising and sensitive. Argentina has had a long history of political instability since the 1930s, and most ordinary folk are incredibly frustrated with their government and political leaders. The Per\u00f3n years and the military juntas are particularly sensitive subjects. While it's not a social faux pas to discuss politics (Argentines tend to be vocal about political issues anyways), do not share your opinions on Argentine politics, even if you know a thing or two about the country's political landscape \u2015 your opinions will not be welcomed and it may cause your Argentine counterpart(s) to think you are meddling in their country's affairs.\nDo not compare Argentina with Brazil and Chile, because they are considered rivals, especially in the economic sphere.\nAvoid comparing regional foods. This too can be a sensitive subject, as recipes and key ingredients vary from province to province.\nArgentines take pride in their beef, and asking for ketchup or barbecue sauce on a steak is disrespectful. You should ask for salsa criolla or chimichurri.\n\n\nLGBT\nSame-sex marriage has been legal since 2010, and Buenos Aires is LGBT-friendly enough that it's been called the \"gay capital of Latin America\". But in small towns, or the more conservative north of the country, some people (especially older generations) might be shocked by public displays of homosexual affection.\n\n\nGeneral\nReligious sites: People do not have to cover their heads when entering a church or temple; Argentina has a liberal attitude towards religion compared to its Latin American neighbors. However, wearing shorts or miniskirts is not encouraged.\nBeach: Sunbathing topless is not a common custom, although you can change clothes on the beach.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nBy phone\nYou can get a prepaid Movistar / Claro / Personal SIM card for a few pesos / free at phone shops, all you pay is about ARS20 (about US$5) for your initial credits. Inserting the SIM card into your unlocked mobile phone should work, although to register the SIM you might have to enter your passport (or any 9 digit) number. You then have your personal Argentinian phone number, which is very useful to keep in touch with other travellers, either by calling or by writing text messages. Calls cost around ARS1 per minute. Still, having to register the SIM card is extremely rare.\nReceiving calls is usually free, except for international calls, and some cross network / inter-city calls. Hence, buying a SIM card purely to keep in touch with people overseas may not be worth it.\nTo reload you can buy small cards with secret numbers at many kiosks, but the easiest way is just to ask for \"Recarga Virtual\" and tell the shop assistant your Phone number and company, and the amount of pesos you want to recharge.\nNot related to mobile phones, there are similar cards with credits for international calls. You get them at so called locutorios, where you can also use the phone booths. You dial a free number to connect to the service, then your secret number for the credits, and then the international phone number you want to call. Using these cards, a one-hour call to Europe will cost about 10 Pesos (3 US-Dollars). Don't call without such cards or even from your hotel \u2014 it will be way more expensive.\nThe phone numbering plan in Argentina is hopelessly complicated for foreigners. Do check out the Wikipedia article about it to find out more.\n\nDirectory Listing (The White Pages): 110\nInternational Operator: 000\nNational Operator: 19\nCollect National Calls: 19 from regular phones, *19 from public phones\nMobile phone numbers start with 15 or 11\nRegional code for Buenos Aires: 011\nOther useful phone numbers include:\n\nOfficial Time: 113\nConsumer Advocacy: +54 11 5382-6216 or 6217\nAll 2 and 3-digit numbers are free, except the official time service (113).\nAll 0800 numbers are toll-free numbers, except if you call from a mobile phone.\nLong-distance calls from Argentina:\nYou may use calling card, ARS0.18/min or ARS0.59/min for calling from Argentina to USA.\n\n\nBy internet\nMost caf\u00e9s and restaurants offer free Wi-Fi with an advertisement in their windows. All you need to do is buy a coffee and ask for the password. Public WiFi is also very common in Buenos Aires with great speeds. The network name will be BA Wifi\n\n\nGo next\nArgentina borders Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, Chile to the east, and Bolivia and Paraguay to the north.\nThe capital of Uruguay, Montevideo, is just an hour away by ferry from the Argentinean capital Buenos Aires. Porto Alegre, in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, is a 14-hour drive from Buenos Aires. A popular summer vacation destination for many Argentines is Florian\u00f3polis, in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, a 19-hour drive away or by flight from Buenos Aires.",
