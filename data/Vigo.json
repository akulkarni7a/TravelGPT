  "extract": "Vigo is a city of almost 295,000 people (2018) in Galicia, Spain. It has some Roman ruins and Romanesque churches.\n\n\nUnderstand\nVigo is not only one of the major industrial cities in Galicia, but it is also one of the more important Roman centres of Pontevedra. Although within the city you will not find much Romanesque architecture, it can be seen a few kilometers away from the city centre. A large number of Roman ruins remain in many of the municipality's neighbourhoods and parishes. Such is the importance of the Roman remains in Vigo that many Spanish authors have come to coin the term rom\u00e1nico vigu\u00e9s (Vigo-style Romanesque). Vigo retains some interesting examples of Romanesque churches in southern Galicia: Santa Mar\u00eda de Castrelos, Santiago de Bembrive, and San Salvador de Coruxo.\nVigo was a 1960s boom town after Franco's government gave this city a free-trade zone in 1947 and a Development Pole in 1964. Vigo is one of the region's primary economic agents, owing in part to the French Citro\u00ebn automotive factory and to the Port of Vigo.\nThe Galician language (Gallego), Portuguese, and Castilian (Spanish) are all spoken in Vigo.\n\n\nClimate\nVigo is the rainiest city in Galicia.
