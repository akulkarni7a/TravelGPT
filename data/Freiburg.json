  "extract": "Freiburg im Breisgau is a major city in a secluded wine-rich corner of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in southwest Germany, on the edge of the Black Forest (Schwarzwald). Picturesquely located on the river Dreisam, in between green mountainsides, it enjoys one of the sunniest and warmest climates among German cities. Freiburg is a laid-back, beautiful university city of 230,000 people (2019).\n\n\nUnderstand\nFreiburg was founded in 1120 and has been a city of importance ever since, which is reflected in the rich medieval and renaissance architectural heritage of its Altstadt. Having been a university town for centuries, it also has a very forward-looking outlook, and is a centre of sustainable development. There are many solar-energy-related businesses headquartered there, and much of the city, especially the newer quarters, is arranged using cutting-edge sustainable development ideas.\nFreiburg is close to a corner where the borders of Germany meet those of France and Switzerland. This is reflected by the city sharing its airport with Basel in Switzerland and Mulhouse in France - the unique EuroAirport whose grounds straddle national borders. While this is the Freiburg most probably referred to when the name is invoked, it is actually one of many places sharing that name. When ordering train tickets and similar items online, be careful not to confuse Freiburg (im Breisgau) with Freiburg (an der Elbe) in Lower Saxony or Fribourg in Switzerland or Freiberg in Saxony.\n\nKnown throughout Germany for Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg, good weather, and vineyards, Freiburg is considered by Germans to be a desirable place to live.\nDue to its secluded location in the \"Dreil\u00e4ndereck\" (Three-country corner) and being fairly removed from any other larger German cities, locals will frequently go shopping in France and Switzerland for their respective native products and go to museums and theaters in Basel or Z\u00fcrich. One can find a strong local patriotism, which shows itself in the anthem of Baden (the former independent state), which can be heard more often than the national anthem.\n\nAlthough Freiburg is not itself a major tourist destination or a large city, it can serve as a relatively inexpensive base from which to explore much of central Europe.\n\n\nTourist information\nFreiburg Tourist information website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n\nYou will most likely arrive in Freiburg by traveling via Frankfurt Airport (FRA IATA) or Zurich Airport (ZRH IATA), both about a 2-hour train ride away from the city. Frankfurt Airport has frequent direct rail connections to Freiburg almost every hour from the Fernbahnhof. Follow the signs once you arrive and buy your ticket at the Deutsche Bahn Reisezentrum (DB Travel Center). Most trains travel directly through Freiburg, although a few require a train change. Booking ahead online can shave the train ticket from Frankfurt Airport considerably, although it requires use of the selected train. If your plane is late, you will have to buy a new ticket. A standard ticket from the DB office at the Fernbahnhof to Freiburg is \u20ac62. Most airlines serving Frankfurt will also offer rail&fly which gives you a highly flexible train ticket at rates usually not much higher than the cheapest discount tickets, but the airlines set the prices, so you might pay more or even get it for free.\nThe closest airport with a good selection of international destinations, though much less frequent than the major airports is the Euroairport Basel/Mulhouse/Freiburg (EAP IATA, BSL IATA and MLH IATA). Buses run frequently from the airport to Freiburg; see the schedule here.\nBaden Airpark, situated between Karlsruhe and Baden-Baden, is another airport close to Freiburg, and it has some international flights from various cities operated mainly by Ryanair and Eurowings. It is a 40-minute train ride to the north of the city, but you will have to connect by bus at the train station, which will add extra time to your journey. You will need to plan ahead to make the trip easier, and Deutsche Bahn's website can give you approximate connection times with bus services. Another possible airport is Stuttgart (STR), which has less convenient train connections but is much closer than Frankfurt.\n\n\nBy train\n\nThe 1 Freiburg Hauptbahnhof  (QFB  IATA) is close to the inner city. Frequent connections run to the north towards Frankfurt and south to Basel, with fast ICE trains leaving in each direction each hour. Again, planning ahead can get cheap fares of \u20ac29 each way. From the Hauptbahnhof, you have direct access to the Tram (Stra\u00dfenbahn) which runs directly overhead the main station and offers an easy route into the city. The Hauptbahnhof is also within easy walking distance of the inner city and several good hotels. Main direct destinations include:\n\nFrankfurt Hauptbahnhof and Airport (Flughafen), 2 hours\nZurich, 2 hours (Switzerland)\nBasel, 40 minutes (express) 1 hr (local), (Switzerland)\nMannheim (close to Heidelberg), 1.5 hours\nBerlin, 6.5 hours\nCologne, 3 hours 10 minutes\nHamburg, 5 hours 45 minutes\nMunich, 4\u00bd hours\nParis, (France), 3 hours\nA single change can bring you to:\n\nStrasbourg, (France), 1\u00bd hours (via Offenburg)\nVienna, (Austria), 9\u00bd hours\nMilan, (Italy), 5\u00bd hours\nAmsterdam, (The Netherlands), 6 hours\nBrussels, (Belgium), 6 hours\nLocal and regional trains can be good for day trips or for traveling to nearby cities. In the main station ask for the L\u00e4ndertickets or the Regio-tickets. Such tickets can be used by a group of up to 5 persons in the RB, RE an S-Bahn trains as well as for local transport. They are a much cheaper alternative for a group of travelers going to cities nearby or going for a day trip.\n\n\nBy car\nFreiburg is connected to the German highway system via the A5, running along the Rhine Valley from south to north, starting at the Swiss border. It also is accessible through the Black Forest via the B31 (Ost). To France it takes about 30 minutes by car. To Switzerland it is about 40 minutes. Heidelberg is a 1\u00bd-hour car ride to the north, using the A5. Lake Constance is reachable in two hours via the B31.\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: Intercity buses in Germany\n2 Freiburg central bus station\n3 Freiburg L\u00f6rracher Stra\u00dfe\nFreiburg is served by Flixbus. You will find direct international connections from Italy (Milan), Switzerland (Zurich, Berne, Geneva, Basel), France (Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg), Belgium (Brussels), Croatia (Zagreb), Slovenia (Ljubljana, Hungary (Budapest) and Austria (Vienna).\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe best way to get around Freiburg is by public transit and walking. Freiburg has an excellent, but slightly expensive, bus and tram (Stra\u00dfenbahn) system. The tram system works all night on weekends and national holidays. There is also a suburban rail system that connects certain suburbs to the black forest.\n\nThe public transportation network is operated by several companies, but ticketing is unified among the local RVF transportation association. Tickets can be used on all buses, trams & local trains in the area. The RVF area is divided into three zones on which the ticket price depends. A single ride is \u20ac2.50 for Zone A (Freiburg city area), \u20ac4.20 for Zone A/B and  \u20ac5.90 for Zones A, B, and C. You can buy a pack of 8 tickets for \u20ac18 valid within Zone A from the VAG Pluspunkt shop, located near the Martinstor downtown. In the shop you can also pick up tickets using a point system; 20 points costs \u20ac16 and in each direction you will use 3 points in Zone A, 5 points if you cross into Zone B, and 7 points if you cross into Zone C. You will most likely only use the tram and bus systems in Zone A for the majority of your stay. If you come for a short stay or a weekend, buy a Regio 24 which will give you 24-hour unlimited travel within Zone A for one person for \u20ac7 and up to five people for \u20ac14. The Regio 24 is also available for 2 or 3 zones. These cards will allow you to use all of the public transport within Freiburg, and also take the DB Regio trains that service the greater region free charge. Timetables and tickets can be found on the VAG Freiburg website.\n\nBiking is another convenient way of getting around, and Freiburg's sidewalks and streets have dedicated bike lanes. Many of Freiburg's citizens use their bikes and you can easily get a real feel for the city this way. Bikes can be rented at various shops, the most convenient for tourists being the Mobile at the main railway station (Hauptbahnhof). In May 2019 the public bike-sharing scheme \"Frelo\" started with 400 bikes at around 50 stations. There are 3-day passes for  \u20ac3 available which allows you to ride the first 30 min for free.\nMost of Freiburg's important sights are situated close to each other in the inner city. You can cross the inner city by walking in about 10\u201315 minutes or by riding the tram. Although passengers are rarely controlled, riding without a valid ticket (Schwarzfahren or \"Black riding\") incurs a \u20ac60 fine! Passengers without tickets have been witnessed being forcibly restrained and removed from the train. The same applies for regional trains, which are controlled about 25% of the time. Those repeatedly caught without a valid ticket can face court orders, as it is considered a criminal offence.\nIf you have rented a car or drive to Freiburg, you will be able to quickly access most areas with your car. Be aware that parking is relatively expensive but there are many garages available where you can park and then walk to nearby destinations. The city of Freiburg is a Low emission zone (Umweltzone). This means all cars - and yes that includes electric cars - driving in the city need a badge (Feinstaubplakette) indicating their pollution category.  In the pedestrian zone bike riders must walk their bikes during daytime on weekdays.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Freiburg Minster (M\u00fcnster Unserer Lieben Frau), M\u00fcnsterplatz 1, \u260f +49 761 208 59 63, info@c-punkt-freiburg.de.

Staufen lies about 20 minutes by car or ~25 minutes by train south of Freiburg.\nVogtsbauernhof: By car (B33 trunk road from Offenburg in the direction of Villingen-Schwenningen or vice versa) or by rail (the Black-Forest route from Offenburg in the direction of Konstanz or vice versa to Hausach station, then 30 minutes on foot) a beautiful outdoor farm life museum, demonstrating 400 years of Black Forest domestic life.\nHike in the Kaiserstuhl, it's lovely. Go and check a so-called Strau\u00dfenwirtschaft (a bar where the wine growers offer their wine & food).\nTake a boat-tour in the Taubergie\u00dfen a floodplain wetland close to the Rhine.\nColmar: Situated across the border in France, Colmar is a beautiful small city. Many locals from Freiburg like to take visitors there for a quick taste of France, as it is only about 1 hour by car. Information about public transport connections into the Alsace is available here. In the summer, take the back roads for glorious views of sunflower fields.\nAlsatian villages: gorgeous, unspoilt villages in the Alsatian wine region: Riquewihr, Ribeauville, Haut K\u00f6nigsberg.\nThe Black Forest: Go hiking or skiing or biking. Just go.\nTitisee, a touristy Black-Forest town, lying in the margins of the lake Titisee.\nSchluchsee, a bigger and less-known lake in the Black Forest. To get there take a Regional Bahn Train from Freiburg Main Station (Hbf) towards Seebrugg. This train travels normally once an hour, and the trip takes around one hour.\nTake one of the wonderful Black-Forest tracks like Feldberg or Schauinsland. The nearest train station to Feldberg is Hinterzarten. Schauinsland can be reached by local buses traveling from Freiburg in the direction of G\u00fcnterstal.\nTake the Aerial tramway of Schauinsland, which travels for 3.6 km over the Black Forest, reaching a place with a very nice panorama.\nDuring the summer months there are 'Weinfeste' in many towns celebrating their wine.\nCross the Black Forest and head to Lake Constance. Ride a bike around it.\nHead to Basel, Berne or Lucerne in Switzerland. From Berne, head on to Interlaken and Brienz. Instead of the train, take the boat across Lake Thun. Same ticket, twice the scenery. Thanks to the new fast train connection between Strasbourg and Paris a trip takes less than 3\u00bd hours from Freiburg.\nGo to Emmendingen.\nGo to Heidelberg.\nGo to Strasbourg.\nVisit Europa Park.
