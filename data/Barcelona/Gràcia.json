  "extract": "Gr\u00e0cia is a district of Barcelona and is the most distinctively Catalan neighbourhood within easy walking distance of the city centre. It was an independent town before it joined the city in the 20th century. Its narrow streets and young atmosphere gives Gr\u00e0cia more of a local than a cosmopolitan feel. The district's many public squares are lively with people, and the wonderful Park G\u00fcell's Gaudi flair and panoramic views of the city delight.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \nThe most convenient way to get to Gr\u00e0cia is Metro line  L3 . Fontana is close to the restaurants and squares; Lesseps and Vallcarca provide access to Park G\u00fcell. From the stations, the heart of Gr\u00e0cia will be to the NNE (this may appear as East or \"to the right\" on most, if not all, maps of Barcelona). The other possibility from the north side of Gr\u00e0cia is to come in via the Joanic  L4  metro station.\nThe Barcelona Bus Tur\u00edstic has a stop in Gr\u00e0cia, near Park G\u00fcell.\nIt's possible to walk to Gr\u00e0cia from Eixample. From Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, it's about 2 km (1.2 mi) up Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and Gran de Gr\u00e0cia to Fontana Metro station.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nPark G\u00fcell\n\n1 Park G\u00fcell (Parc G\u00fcell, G\u00fcell Park), Carrer D'Olot 5, \u260f +34 934 091 831, toll-free: +34 902 200 302, parkguell@bsmsa.cat. Oct 25-Mar: 08:30-18:15; Mar Sep7-Oct24: 08:00-20:00; May-Sep 6: 08:00-21:30; (last entry 30-45 min earlier). A large urban park heavily influenced by Antonio Gaudi. The area was originally meant to be a residential property development with Gaudi doing much of the planning and landscape design. Only two houses were built and the land was later sold to the city of Barcelona and turned into a park. There are two areas -- a relatively undeveloped (and un-crowded) natural area near the top of the hill and the more famous sculpture park below. The top of the park offers panoramic views of Barcelona, while the sculpture portion is full of walkways and other structures exhibiting the distinct and colourful style of Gaudi, including the famous terrace and fountains near the main entrance. You are strongly advised to buy tickets days in advance. Don't expect to be able to buy one on the day. Be patient when exploring the site, as once you enter the Natural Plaza where crowds gather, you are confined to a one-way path that you must traverse before backtracking if you want to return to higher ground. Park G\u00fcell is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the Works of Antonio Gaudi. \u20ac10; reduced \u20ac7.00, children until 6 - free ticket required.   (updated Mar 2024)\nPopular sights and attractions within the park include:\n\n2 Park G\u00fcell, the main entrance. Two Gaudi-style pavilions mark the entrance to the park and lead to the steps up to the Hipostila Room. In the middle of the steps is the dragon (or salamander) fountain that has become almost as much a symbol of Barcelona as the Sagrada Familia. \n3 Hipostila Room and Grand Plaza (terrace). At the top of the stairs from the main entrance is the Hipostila Room with its 86 white columns supporting the plaza above. The ceiling has a number of colourful mosaics. Above the Hipostila Room is the main terrace, which was meant to be the main square of the development. It features a mosaic-tiled wall in the shape of an undulating sea serpent and provides excellent views of Barcelona. \n4 Gaudi House Museum (Casa Museu Gaudi), Park G\u00fcell - Carretera del Carmel, 23A (Metro L3 Lesseps, then follow signs to Park G\u00fcell), \u260f +34 932 193 811, info@casamuseugaudi.org. From 1 January 2024, the Gaud\u00ed House Museum will be closed for maintenance and renovations.. Distinctive pink house that Gaudi lived in for nearly 20 years (although not designed by him). It features furniture designed by Gaudi and other objects relating to Gaudi's life. The gift shop has a large selection of Gaudi-themed souvenirs that are generally better quality than what's available in the normal tourist shops.   (updated Mar 2024)\n5 Turo de les tres creus (The Calvary). This is the highest point of the park and where Gaudi wanted to build a chapel. After the development failed, Gaudi built a monolith with three crosses like Calvary instead. Be sure to take in the panoramic views of Barcelona. \nThe park is popular with tourists and locals alike and can be very busy on afternoons and weekends, particularly in the summer (but the queue to the Gaudi House Museum can be long even outside of the summer). Open daily 10:00-21:00 (May-Aug), 10:00-20:00 (Apr & Sept), 10:00-19:00 (Mar & Oct), 10:00-18:00 (Nov - Feb).\nThere's a limit of 400 visitors entering in each 30-min. time slot, though once you enter, you can stay as long as you want (but you can't leave and re-enter).\nDirections: Bus 24, D40 & H6 stop Trav de Dalt - Torrent de les Flors.  From there walk uphill on Carrer de Larrard to the park. Lesseps  L3  Exit the station and follow the arrows that are every 300 m. It is a steep climb! \nVallcarca  L3  As of Feb 2024, escalators are out of service. Exit the station and head down Av de Vallcarca to Baixada de la Gloria and follow the signs to the park. It is also a steep climb but there are a number of escalators along the way. This route enters the park near the Turo de les tres creus rather than the main entrance.\n\n\nOther attractions\nCheck out any plaza and it will most likely be humming with life and vibrancy.\n\nProsperous private villas can be found above the Guell Park.\n6 Casa Vicens, C/de les Carolines 24 (Fontana  L3  buses 22, 24, 27, 87, D40).
