  "extract": "The Inland Suburbs are the districts that ring the main part of Barcelona. To the southwest, it includes Les Corts and Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi, and to the northwest it includes Horta-Guinardo, Nou Barris and Sant Andreau. These areas are mostly residential but there are some good attractions for those who want to explore the districts outside of Barcelona's centre.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n\n\nSarri\u00e0-Les Corts\nLes Corts is serviced by  L3  on the metro system, connecting the district with Sants-Montju\u00efc and Ciutat Vella. It runs along Diagonal, providing access to the shopping district and the Palau Reial.

Inpatient wards (and most outpatient facilities) have been moved to a new building of Nou Hospital, but in terms of touring the area, that makes it all the easier. One of \"small hidden features\" is a network of underground passages where small carriages can be seen, you can get there near WCs on a central square, between Banc de Sang and Quir\u00f2fans.

(updated Aug 2024)\n\n\nFC Barcelona\n5 Camp Nou, Carrer d'Aristides Maillol, 12. If you're a football fanatic, then you can't miss a visit to this football temple, the home ground for Barcelona's biggest and most popular team and one of Europe's greatest footballing 'cathedrals'. During the Franco era, FCB was the only way that oppressed Catalans could vent their anger against his dictatorship. Because of that, it became and still is a symbol of Catalan identity. Camp Nou is the biggest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 98,600 people, with shops and a museum of the club's history. Match tickets start at about \u20ac42 and games hardly ever completely sell out, unless it is a match against the hated rivals Real Madrid (a match commonly dubbed El Cl\u00e1sico), one of the other top teams (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Valencia or Sevilla) or in the Champions League. With the quality in the current team, there are always a few goals, and it is nearly always a resounding win for Bar\u00e7a. For stadium tours check the entry below.   \n6 Futbol Club Barcelona Museum (Camp Nou Experience), Carrer d'Aristides Maillol, 12 (Metro L3 to Palau Reai, then a 10-min walk along Carrer de Mart\u00ed i Franqu\u00e8s.), \u260f +34 902 18 99 00. 09:00-19:00; Dec 25, Jan 1 closed (deviating on match days). Museum dedicated to the FC Barcelona. It occupies 3,500 m\u00b2 and attracts 1.2 million visitors a year, ranking it second to the Museu Picasso, which attracts 1.3 million visitors, as the most visited museum in the city of Barcelona. All of Barcas trophies and jerseys of many famous players of the team are exhibited. The museum can be visited by booking the Camp Nou Experience package, which includes also a stadium tour. The stadium tour is not fantastic and the audio guide is not really worth it either, but for a quick recent history of matches played there, consult the backs of the doors in the cubicles. Most have a lot of graffiti championing the team that played there. It is also unfortunate that the home team changing rooms are not open to the public, only the somewhat dated guest's team dressing rooms, which are not that impressive. \u20ac25 (\u20ac20 for people from 6-13 and >70 years old).

Located on the mountains of Barcelona (farther north from Gracia) and offers a spectacular view of the city (532 m high). This is a place where according some legends, the Devil tempted Jesus Christ offering him the whole world in exchange for his worship. At the top there is an awesome church, which offers panoramic views of the city. The church is almost completely surrounded by a big amusement park. You will also find an observatory and an ascendable communications tower nearby. The beautifully scenic walk down is lined with some un-missable Spanish architecture for your photo album. You can not take photos very well from the tram, but the walk is wonderful. The cafe con leche at the cafe near the church is terrible. Try at the bottom of the funicular.   (updated Oct 2015)\n Tramvia Blau (blue tramway). It is an old tram (beginning of the 20th century) connecting Av. Tibidabo metro station and Funicular station at the foot of Tibidabo.

It connects the terminus of Tramvia Blau at the Pla\u00e7a del Doctor Andreu with an amusement park at the summit of the Tibidabo mountain. It's an underwhelming ride.

Not really in Gr\u00e0cia, but next to it, it's one of the restaurants of the Tuset street years, when the Gauche Divine was the cool group in the city. This restaurant was made as a cool bar during the late 1960s and it remains unchanged. The food's good (omelettes is the speciality and the cheapest option).

They have a menu del noche (like the menu del dia), which provides a good value and the proprietor served his own wine from the \"Ribera\" (del duero) region of Spain.

Halfway between an Ibis and a Mercure, this simple hotel offers very attractive rates, which compensate for it being slightly out of the way (yet still close enough to explore Gr\u00e0cia and Eixample), and quite basic rooms. The cheapest rooms are quite worn, and the level of renovation increase with price. The hotel's restaurant is more of a cafe, offering very basic dishes (mostly pre-prepared) at reasonable prices. A selection of packaged snacks and drinks can be bought at the reception from what they call a \"mini bar\". \u20ac92. \n3 AC Hotel Irla, Carre de Calvet Calvet, 40-42, \u260f +34 932 41 62 10.
