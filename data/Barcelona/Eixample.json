  "extract": "The Eixample is the quarter designed during the middle of the 19th century by Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, expanding the medieval city of Barcelona into space left empty for defense outside the city walls. It's an enormous field of rectangular blocks in a continuously repeating layout, with the constant threat of getting lost (at least for those used to European cities). Eixample contains most of the modernist buildings, including La Pedrera, Casa Batll\u00f3 and La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. A very interesting example for planned urban development and subsequent re-planning and restructuring.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \nEixample is in the middle of Barcelona so it's easily accessible by road, train, bus or metro. The  L3  metro, with stops at Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia and Diagonal, connects the district to Gr\u00e0cia and Ciutat Vella.  L5  and  L2  both stop at the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and  L2  also stops at the University.  L1  and  L5  connect the district with Sants-Montju\u00efc.\nPasseig de Gr\u00e0cia is a main regional rail station in the area it is served by lines  R2  which connects to the airport and  R2SUD  R2NORD  along with other regional trains.\nOther regional trains stop at Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya\nDriving a car in Eixample is possible, though you may find difficulties to find a decent parking place in peak hours. Note that there are two zones for paid parking and prices varies depending on demand. (Green Zone, \u20ac1.08-2.42/hr)\n\n\nSee\n\n\nSagrada Fam\u00edlia\n1 Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Bas\u00edlica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia), Carrer de Mallorca, 401 (Sardenya and Mallorca; Sagrada Familia  L2  L5 ), \u260f +34 932 080 414, informacio@sagradafamilia.org. Open daily 09:00-18:00 (Nov-Mar), 09:00-19:00 (Oct, Mar), 09:00-20:00 (Apr-Sep). Barcelona's most popular and famous attraction, the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is a testament to Antonio Gaudi's modernist style and unlike any other church in the world. The texture and detail on the fa\u00e7ades are intricate and incorporate forms seen in nature as much of Gaudi's work does. The inside is huge \u2014 it's estimated that it can hold 13,000 people \u2014 with vaulted ceilings and columns designed to be reminiscent of trees. The church is still under construction, but the central nave, apse and crypt are open. Seeing the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia at night with lights on is impressive \u2014 this is the time when you understand why people say that it is built of bones. \u20ac26 for adult, with audio guide, \u20ac30 if tour included. \u20ac10 extra to visit the towers.   (updated Mar 2024)\nAn audioguide is recommended. You will get a much better appreciation of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, but it does last for over 90 minutes.\nA trip to the towers costs extra but provides a different perspective to the church. There are two fa\u00e7ades to choose from: Fa\u00e7ana del Naixement (Nativity fa\u00e7ade) and Fa\u00e7ana de la Passi\u00f3 (Passion fa\u00e7ade).\nThe first one was constructed between 1894 and 1930, and reflects Gaudi's style to the most. The Nativity fa\u00e7ade is lower and faces to the east of Barcelona, but you could visit two towers there and then climb down by the famous stairs.\nThe lift to the towers at the Passion fa\u00e7ade goes up 85 m and offers you a panoramic view towards the centre of the city.Then you descend by foot, which takes 10-20 minutes.\nThe entries to the lifts are on the left of the doors of the respective fa\u00e7ade (looking from inside). There are some lockers there where the visitors are asked to leave their oversized items. Children under 6, unaccompanied children under 16 and elderly people with reduced mobility cannot go up into the towers.\n\n\nTickets\nChurch: Walking around the outside of the church is free, but getting inside requires patience and money. If you walk up and buy a ticket, expect a line and possible disappointment. It is strongly advised to buy tickets (preferably days in advance) online, so to avoid waiting in a queue. Once a ticket is bought it needs to be presented to an attendant either printed or as a code at a smart-phone (do not go to the ticket booth!).\nTowers: Tickets for the tower lifts must be purchased at the same time you buy your entry ticket because they have time slots. Make sure you know which lift you are going to take since there are two of them. When buying a ticket \"offline\", at a ticket booth, and you go later than 10:00, expect to wait at least an hour (two hours is possible on busy days). You must choose your entrance time to the church to be before the time of a visit to the towers, but after you descend from the towers you are free to continue your visit to the church, the museum and other sights.\n\n\nFurther UNESCO World Heritage Listings\n2 Casa Batll\u00f3, Passeig de Gracia 43 (corner of Carrer de Arago; Passeig de Gracia  L2  L3  L4 ), \u260f +34 932 16 03 06, info@casabatllo.cat. 09:00-22:00 Last entry 20:45.
