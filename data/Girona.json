  "extract": "Girona is the chief city of Prov\u00edncia de Girona in Catalonia, northeast Spain. In Castilian Spanish it's called Gerona, but this page uses Catalan spellings. In 2023 the city had a population of 104,320, with about another 50,000 in the adjoining town of Salt.\nThe city is astride trade and pilgrimage routes from France into Spain, and pilgrimage traffic is as strong as ever: \"But we're nowhere near Barcelona!\" is the plaintive cry of sun-seekers who boarded a flight to a place that Ryanair called Barcelona-Girona. It's actually less than 100 km, the transfer bus will be along any minute, and for beach resorts along the Costa Brava, Girona is the closest airport. But it would be a mistake to rush away to those places and fail to explore this fascinating ancient city, with its cathedral, walls and higgledy-piggledy medieval streets ranged upon the hillside.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nGirona is at the confluence of the Ter, Onyar, Galligants and G\u00fcell rivers, so transport routes across Catalonia are focussed here. It was the Roman city of Gerunda, astride their cross-country road to C\u00e1diz. It was captured by the Moors in 715 AD but reconquered by the Holy Roman Empire in 785, though it suffered a century of destructive further attacks. So like other northern towns, Girona doesn't have the Moorish heritage seen in Andalucia, which they held for another 700 years. It did however acquire a large Jewish population, until they were expelled from Spain in 1492. From the 17th to 19th centuries it was repeatedly assaulted from France, but this ended with the defeat of Napoleon. Its city walls were then taken down on the west side, but have been retained on the east side around Old Town (Barri Vell) and the university.\nTown centre is along the Onyar river, with Old Town on the east bank; the Onyar then joins the larger Ter, swinging north towards the coast. C de Calderers is the main thoroughfare on this bank. New Town is west and south, a 19th-century grid with the majority of shops, hotels and restaurants, plus the railway and bus stations.\nGirona is an all-year destination but in winter can suffer cold winds from the mountains, with temperatures sometimes below \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F), and frequent rain. In summer temperatures often soar to 30\u201340 \u00b0C (86\u2013104 \u00b0F), and citizens escape to the coast whenever they can.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Girona Airport (GRO  IATA), \u260f +34 913 211000. Ryanair are the main operator, with year-round flights to/from some regional airports in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Poland, as well as London Stansted and Marrakesh. It's a single terminal with the usual facilities, plenty big enough for its limited traffic. Ryanair, along with 6 other airlines also operate flights to more European destinations in the high season only.   (updated Mar 2024)\nTo town: Sagal\u00e9s Bus 607 runs at irregular hours to meet the flights, taking 30 min to the bus station. Bus 602 from Barcelona Airport/Barcelona/Aeroport de Girona/Girona/Figures also stops here. It's the same ticket for either (\u20ac2.60 in 2024), buy from the kiosk by the bus stops.\n\n\nBy train\n \nFour high speed international trains per day run from Barcelona Sants (one starting from Madrid via Zaragoza), taking 40 min non-stop to Girona. They continue north to Figueres, Perpignan and Narbonne, then fan out to Paris, Lyon and Marseille. Reservations are compulsory.\nAVE fast domestic trains run every 30 min from Barcelona Sants, taking 40 min non-stop to Girona and continuing to Figueres. \nRodalies are the regional trains.  R11  runs hourly from Barcelona Sants taking 90 min, then continues north via Figueres and multiple other stops to Portbou and Cerb\u00e8re across the border. Until the high speed line opened in 2010 this was the railway route from France (Salvador Dal\u00ed painted a typically surreal impression of the journey) and you can still come this way.\n2 Girona railway station, Pla\u00e7a Espanya. The main station hall is off C Barcelona beneath the elevated conventional tracks. This has a ticket office and machines, a cafe, newspaper shop and toilets but no luggage lockers, and taxi ranks both sides. The low anonymous building on its west flank has a cafe at ground level, the bus station one floor down and the high speed railway platforms three floors down. Only one ticket machine down here so buy in the main hall.   (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nBy bus\nThe bus station is underground within the high-speed part of the railway station. One overnight Flixbus runs from Barcelona to Girona, and continues to B\u00e9ziers, Montpellier, N\u00eemes and Lyon - change there for Paris. Their buses from Madrid and further south don't stop in Girona.\nBlablacar is a ride-share system from other cities.\nSagal\u00e9s is the main bus line within Catalonia. Bus 602 runs three times a day from Barcelona El Prat Airport T1 and T2 to Barcelona bus station, Girona Airport and town (2 hr 30 min) and continues to Figueres.\nBus 601 runs from Blanes every hour or two, taking 70 minutes.\nBus e4 663 runs from Lloret de Mar every 30 min, taking 40 minutes.\n\n\nBy road\nFrom France follow A9 / E15 south past Narbonne, Perpignan and Figueres.\nFrom Barcelona follow E15 north.\nCar hire is available at the airport and by the railway station.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy foot\nWalk both Old Town and New Town west of the river are compact and mostly pedestrianized. In Old Town, expect gradients, lumpy cobblestones and steep stairs.\nDon't take a car into the old streets, you'll need a tin opener to get it out again.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses have nine local lines:\n\nL1 is north\u2013south from Montju\u00efc to Devesa Park, railway & bus station, Migdia and Avellaneda.\nL2 is north\u2013south from Josep Trueta Hospital to Devesa Park then as L1.\nL5 is north\u2013south from Germans-Sabat to Devesa Park, Salt and Aiguaviva.\nL7 is east\u2013west from Torre Gironella to Hospital Santa Caterina.\nL8 is from the railway & bus station, and L9 from Salt, and L11 from G\u00fcell, all heading south to the university Centre and Montilivi campuses.\nL10 is south from the railway & bus station to Fornells.\nL12 loops town from Josep Trueta Hospital to Av Ramon Folch and the cathedral to Sant Daniel.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nThere are many well-signed bicycle trails in and around the city. See \"Buy\" for the bike shop near Plaza de Catalunya.\nGirocleta is the bike-share service, based at the bus station.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Catedral de Girona (Cathedral of Saint Mary of Girona), Pla\u00e7a de la Catedral, \u260f +34 972 427189.

As in Barcelona, \"Montju\u00efc\" means \"Hill of the Jews\" and was their cemetery; their homes and businesses were on \"The Call\", C de la For\u00e7a near the cathedral. After they were expelled in 1492 most of the tombstones were pilfered for masonry but several survive in museums. The cemetery was forgotten until the railway drilled through in 1862 and there's nothing to see of it now. The hill was declared a \"green zone\" in 1955 but became a squatters' shanty town, until 1971 when the squatters also were expelled and the area turned into residential suburbs. You'd only come up here for the view, take Bus L1.\n14 Palau-Sacosta Castle  is a sturdy well-preserved fortress with two distinctive towers, mostly built from 1495.
