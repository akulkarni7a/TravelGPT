Its long and rich history is present in people's thinking and values, and in the art, architecture, and feats of engineering that remain from dynasties past. In addition to its bustling and futuristic cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, China boasts an incredible array of breathtaking natural wonders like the karst landscapes of Guilin and granite peaks of Huangshan that have inspired painters and poets for generations.\nAfter a tumultuous 19th and 20th centuries, China has dramatically re-emerged as an economic powerhouse. Its rapid development has been paralleled by an ascent onto the international stage. Of course there are growing pains when high-rises and factories surge up to dwarf centuries-old pagodas, but there's also a strong sense of enthusiasm and optimism about what the future holds. If you visit now, you can see the relics of millennia of history and experience the signs of further transformations in progress.\n\n\nRegions\nChina's hierarchy of administrative divisions has 22 provinces (\u7701 sh\u011bng) which tend to have their own cultural identities, and 5 autonomous regions (\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b), each with a designated minority ethnic group. These along with four municipalities (\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02 zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec) make up what is known as mainland China (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u5185\u5730 Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 d\u00e0l\u00f9, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 n\u00e8id\u00ec).\n\nFor the purposes of Wikivoyage, these provinces are grouped into the following regions:\n\n\nCities\n\nHere are nine of China's most interesting cities for travelers. Others are listed in region articles.\n\n1 Beijing (\u5317\u4eac) \u2014 the capital, cultural center, and home of the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and other important historical sites.\n2 Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd) \u2014 capital of Sichuan province, known for tingly-spicy food, and home of the giant pandas.\n3 Guangzhou (\u5e7f\u5dde) \u2014 one of China's most prosperous and liberal cities. Center of Cantonese culture and cuisine.\n\n4 Hangzhou (\u676d\u5dde) \u2014 built around West Lake, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, and southern terminus of the Grand Canal.\n5 Harbin (\u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8) \u2014 capital of Heilongjiang, which hosts the Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival during its bitterly cold winters.\n6 Kashgar (Chinese: \u5580\u4ec0, Uyghur: \u0642\u06d5\u0634\u0642\u06d5\u0631) \u2014 center of Uyghur culture, with a beautiful and well-preserved old town, and the famous Id Kah Mosque.\n7 Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac) \u2014 the capital during the early Ming Dynasty and Republic of China era, a renowned historical and cultural city with many historic sites.\n8 Shanghai (\u4e0a\u6d77) \u2014 China's largest city and main commercial centre, famous for its beautiful pre-World War II French, British and American colonial architecture, ultramodern 21st-century skyscrapers, and many shopping opportunities.\n9 Xi'an (\u897f\u5b89) \u2014 the oldest city and ancient capital of China, terminus of the ancient Silk Road, and home of the terracotta warriors.\nYou can travel to many of these cities using the new fast trains. In particular, the Hangzhou - Shanghai - Suzhou - Nanjing line is a convenient way to see these historic areas.\n\n\nOther destinations\nSome of the most famous tourist attractions in China are:\n\n1 Great Wall of China (\u4e07\u91cc\u957f\u57ce) \u2014 longer than 8,000 km, this ancient wall is the most iconic landmark of China.\n2 Hainan (\u6d77\u5357) \u2014 a tropical paradise island undergoing heavy tourism-oriented development.\n3 Jiuzhaigou Nature Reserve (\u4e5d\u5be8\u6c9f) \u2014 known for its many multi-level waterfalls, colourful lakes and as the home of the giant pandas.\n4 Leshan \u2014 most famous for its huge riverside cliff-carving of Buddha and nearby Mount Emei.\n5 Mount Everest \u2014 straddling the border between Nepal and Tibet, this is the world's highest mountain.\n6 Mount Tai (\u6cf0\u5c71 T\u00e0i Sh\u0101n) \u2014 one of the five sacred Taoist mountains in China, and the most-climbed mountain in China.\n7 Tibet (\u897f\u85cf) \u2014 with a majority of Tibetan Buddhists and traditional Tibetan culture, it feels like an entirely different world.\n8 Yungang Grottoes (\u4e91\u5188\u77f3\u7a9f) \u2014 these mountain-side caves and recesses number more than 50, and are filled with 51,000 Buddhist statues.\n9 Guilin karst (\u6842\u6797) \u2014 sensational mountain landscapes that have long been the subject of Chinese paintings.\nChina has over 50 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nChina is one of the major civilizations in this world, and for many centuries stood out as a leading nation with technologies that the West was not able to match until the early modern period. Paper and gunpowder are examples of Chinese inventions that are still widely used today. As the dominant power in the region for much of its history, China exported much of its culture to neighboring Vietnam, Korea and Japan, and Chinese influences can still be seen in the cultures of these countries.\nChinese civilization has endured millennia of tumultuous upheaval and revolutions, golden ages and periods of anarchy. Through the economic boom initiated by the reforms since the 1980s, China has returned to its place as a major political and economic world power, buoyed by its large and industrious population. The depth and complexity of the Chinese civilization, with its rich heritage, has fascinated Westerners such as Marco Polo and Gottfried Leibniz in centuries past, and will continue to excite \u2014 and bewilder \u2014 the traveller today.\nIn Chinese, China is zh\u014dng gu\u00f3, literally \"central state\" but often translated more poetically as \"Middle Kingdom\". People from everywhere else are called w\u00e0igu\u00f3r\u00e9n (\u5916\u56fd\u4eba, \"outside country people\"), or colloquially l\u01ceow\u00e0i, \"old outsider\" with \"old\" in the sense of venerable or respected (in practice, these terms mostly refer to white people or Westerners, and almost never to any foreigner of Chinese descent).\n\n\nHistory\nSee Imperial China for more information on pre-revolutionary China.\n\n\nAncient China\nAccording to legend, the origin of the Chinese civilization can be traced to the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors (\u4e09\u7687\u4e94\u5e1d), though they are regarded as mythical figures by most modern historians.\nThe recorded history of Chinese civilization can be traced back to the Yellow River valley, said to be the \"cradle of Chinese civilization\". The Xia Dynasty (\u590f\u671d, c.2070 BC- c.1600 BC) was the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical chronicles, though to date, no indisputable proof of its existence has been found. Some archaeologists have linked the Erlitou settlements to the Xia dynasty, but this is a controversial position.\nThe Shang Dynasty (\u5546\u671d, c.1600 BC- 1046 BC), China's first archaeologically confirmed dynasty, only ruled across the Yellow River basin. There were other civilisations in what is now China at about the same time, at least the Liangzhu Culture in the lower Yangtze region around Lake Tai and one further up that river in Sichuan whose main archeological site is at Sanxingdui. The Shang and the Sanxingdu people were Bronze Age cultures, while Liangzhu had the last neolithic culture in its region.\n\nThe Shang were succeeded by the Zhou Dynasty (\u5468\u671d, 1046 BC- 256 BC), who expanded their empire southward into the Yangtze river basin. The Zhou adopted feudalism as their system of government; feudal lords ruled over their respective territories with a high degree of autonomy, even maintaining their own armies, while at the same time paying tribute to the king and recognizing him as the symbolic ruler of China.\nDuring the second half of the Zhou period, China descended into centuries of political turmoil, with the feudal lords of numerous small fiefdoms vying for power during the Spring and Autumn Period (\u6625\u79cb\u65f6\u4ee3, 770 BC- 476 BC), and later stabilized into seven large states in the Warring States period (\u6218\u56fd\u65f6\u4ee3, 475 BC- 221 BC). This tumultuous period gave birth to China's greatest thinkers including Confucius, Mencius and Laozi (also spelt Lao-Tzu), who made substantial contributions to Chinese thought and culture, as well as the military strategist Sun Tzu, whose Art of War is studied to this day.\n\n\nImperial China\nSee also: On the trail of Marco Polo\nChina was unified in 221 BC under Qin Shi Huang, \"First Emperor of Qin\". His Qin Dynasty (\u79e6\u671d, 221 BC\u2014206 BC) instituted a centralized system of government for China, and standardized weights and measures, Chinese characters and currency to create unity. The Han Dynasty (\u6c49\u671d, 206 BC\u2014220 AD) took over in 206 BC after a period of revolt and civil war, ushering in the first golden age of Chinese civilization. To this day the majority Chinese race use the term \"Han\" to describe themselves, and Chinese characters continue to be called \"Han characters\" (\u6c49\u5b57 h\u00e0nz\u00ec) in Chinese. The Han Dynasty presided over the beginning of the Silk Road, and the invention of paper. The empire was also expanded further southward, incorporating what is today Fujian, Guangdong and northern Vietnam.\nThe collapse of the Han Dynasty in AD 220 led to a period of political turmoil and war known as the Three Kingdoms Period (\u4e09\u56fd\u65f6\u671f, 220\u2014280), which China split into the three separate states of Wei (\u9b4f, 220-265), Shu (\u8700, 221\u2014263) and Wu (\u5434, 222\u2014280). The Jin Dynasty (\u664b\u671d, 265\u2014420) reunified China in AD 280, though the reunification was short-lived, and China would rapidly descend into civil war and division again. From AD 420 to 589, China was divided into  two parts, the Southern and Northern dynasties (\u5357\u5317\u671d). The Sui Dynasty (\u968b\u671d, 581\u2014618) reunified China in 581. Sui were famous for major public works projects, such as the engineering feat of the Grand Canal, which gradually developed into the Canal linking Beijing in the north to Hangzhou in the south. Certain sections of the canal are still navigable today.\n\nIn 618 AD, the Sui were supplanted by the Tang Dynasty (\u5510\u671d, 618- 907), ushering in the second golden age of Chinese civilization, marked by a flowering of Chinese poetry, the rise of Buddhism and statecraft. After the collapse of the Tang Dynasty in AD 907, China was divided again, until it was reunified under the Song Dynasty (\u5b8b\u671d, 960\u20141279) in AD 960. In 1127, the Song were driven south of the Huai river by the Jurchens, where they continued to rule as the Southern Song based in Linan (\u4e34\u5b89 L\u00edn'\u0101n, modern-day Hangzhou). Although militarily weak, the Song was China's economic golden age, attaining a high level of commercial and economic development that would be unmatched in the West until the Industrial Revolution. The Yuan Dynasty (\u5143\u671d, 1271\u20141368, one of the four divisions of the Mongol Empire) defeated the Jurchens, then conquered the Song in 1279, and ruled the vast empire from Khanbaliq (\u5927\u90fd D\u00e0d\u016b, modern-day Beijing).\nAfter defeating the Mongols, the Ming dynasty (\u660e\u671d, 1368\u20141644) re-instituted rule by ethnic Han. The Ming period was noted for trade and exploration, with Zheng He's numerous voyages to Southeast Asia, India and the Arab world, even reaching the eastern coast of Africa; see Maritime Silk Road. Famous buildings in Beijing, such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, were built in this period. The last imperial dynasty, the Qing dynasty (\u6e05\u671d, 1644\u20141911), were ethnic Manchus who further expanded the Chinese empire to roughly its current boundaries by incorporating the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet.\nThe Qing dynasty fell into decay in the 19th century and China was often described as the \"sick man of Asia\" (\u6771\u4e9e\u75c5\u592b/\u4e1c\u4e9a\u75c5\u592b). It was nibbled apart by the Western powers and Japan, a period dubbed by the Chinese as the \"Century of Humiliation\". The Westerners and Japanese established their own treaty ports in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin. China lost several territories to foreign powers, including Hong Kong to Britain, and Taiwan to Japan, and it lost control of its tributaries, Vietnam, Korea and the Ryukyu Islands. This is also the period where the stereotypical appearance of Chinese people, such as pigtails, Manchu hairstyles, and magua (a kind of Manchu clothing) got rooted in other foreign countries due to a surge of foreign communications since the sea ban. The turmoil during the end of the Qing Dynasty and Republic of China-era led to the emigration of many Chinese, who established overseas Chinese communities in many other parts of the world. Most overseas Chinese who emigrated before World War II were from Fujian, Guangdong or Hainan, making those provinces the natural places to go if you want to explore the legacy of the Overseas Chinese.\n\n\nThe Republic and World War II\nSee also: Chinese Revolutionary Destinations, Pacific War, Long March\nThe 2000-year-old imperial system collapsed in 1911, when Sun Yat-Sen founded the Republic of China. Central rule collapsed in 1916 after Yuan Shih-kai, the second president of the Republic and self-declared emperor, passed away; China descended into anarchy, with warlords ruling over different regions of China and fighting wars with each other. In 1919, student protests in Beijing over the perceived unfavorable terms of the Treaty of Versailles (since China had participated in World War I as part of the Allies) gave birth to the \"May Fourth Movement\", which espoused reforms to Chinese society, such as the use of the vernacular in writing, and the development of science and democracy. The intellectual ferment of the movement gave birth to the reorganized Kuomintang (KMT) in 1919 and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 1921. It also laid the foundation for the establishment of Standard Mandarin as the first standard spoken form of Chinese for the entire country.\nAfter much of eastern China was united under KMT rule in 1928, the CCP and the KMT turned on each other, and the CCP fled to Yan'an in Shaanxi in the epic Long March. Although Shanghai became one of the most prosperous cities in East Asia during the 1920s and 30s, underlying problems throughout the vast countryside, particularly the more inland parts of the country, such as civil unrest, extreme poverty, famines and warlord conflict, remained.\nJapan established a puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria in 1931, and launched a full-scale invasion of China's heartland in 1937. The Japanese implemented a brutal system of rule in the occupied territories, culminating in the Nanjing Massacre of 1937. After fleeing west to Chongqing, the KMT signed a tenuous agreement with the CCP to form a united front against the Japanese. With the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II in 1945, the KMT and CCP armies maneuvered for positions in north China, setting the stage for the civil war. The civil war lasted from 1945 to 1949. The Kuomintang were defeated and forced to retreat to Taiwan where they hoped to re-establish themselves and recapture the mainland someday.\n\n\nA Red China\n\nOn 1 Oct 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China (\u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd). After an initial period closely hewing to the Soviet model of heavy industrialization and comprehensive central economic planning, China began to experiment with adapting Marxism to a largely agrarian society.\nMassive social experiments rocked China from 1957 to 1976. The Great Leap Forward aimed to collectivize and industrialize China quickly. The Cultural Revolution aimed to change everything by discipline, destruction of the \"Four Olds\" (customs, culture, habits, ideas), and total dedication to Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution are generally considered disastrous failures in China that caused the deaths of tens of millions of people. The effects of the Cultural Revolution in particular can still be felt: many elements of traditional Chinese culture and folk beliefs continue to thrive in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas Chinese communities, but have largely disappeared in mainland China.\nMao died in 1976, and in 1978, Deng Xiaoping became China's paramount leader. Deng and his lieutenants gradually introduced market-oriented reforms and decentralized economic decision making. One of the innovations was the creation of Special Economic Zones with tax breaks and other government measures to encourage investment and development; these still exist and are quite prosperous.\nChina's miraculous growth since 1978 has been an extraordinary achievement. Significant problems remain, however, including inflation, regional income inequality, human rights abuses, major environmental issues, rural poverty, and ethnic conflict in Xinjiang and Tibet. In particular, blatant corruption was a major cause of large scale political movements in 1989, which in turn resulted in the bloody suppression of protesters in urban Beijing, often known as the Tiananmen Massacre. The incident is still a sensitive and highly censored topic in China.\nHu Jintao, who was paramount leader from around 2002 to 2012, proclaimed a policy for a \"Harmonious Society\", which promised to restore balanced economic growth and channel investment and prosperity into China's central and western provinces. China has developed economically at a breakneck speed since the 1990s, and overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy after the United States in 2010, cementing its place again as a major political, military and economic world power. China has also expanded its international clout and become a major source of foreign investment, particularly in the less developed countries of Asia, Africa and increasingly in Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific island nations as well. President Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, which attempts to expand international trading networks through Chinese investment in transportation infrastructure. It largely follows the route of the old Silk Road. While Xi's administration is often criticized for being more dictatorial than previous ones, China's international influence has also expanded considerably under him, and blatant corruption has been significantly reduced. Moreover, many poorer areas in western China that had largely been left behind by the economic boom are now beginning to see more government investment in infrastructure and poverty alleviation. China is now an upper middle income country.\nTwo former colonies, Hong Kong (British) and Macau (Portuguese), rejoined China in 1997 and 1999 respectively. They are Special Administrative Regions (SARs), run differently under the slogan \"One country, two systems\". This article does not cover them because for practical travel purposes, they function like different countries with their own visas, currencies, and laws.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSee also: Chinese provinces and regions\nChina is an authoritarian state ruled by the Communist Party of China. The \"paramount leader\" is the General Secretary of the Communist Party, who holds several other offices including ceremonial President. The State Council forms the executive branch; the next most powerful leader is the Premier of the State Council, who is the head of government (like a prime minister). The legislative branch consists of the unicameral National People's Congress (NPC), the largest legislature in the world with almost 3,000 delegates. The NPC is often described as a \"rubber stamping\" body; it vetoed no bills and members have complained about their lack of power.\nChina largely follows a centralized system of government, and is administratively divided into 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 directly controlled municipalities. Provincial governments have limited powers in their internal and economic affairs. Autonomous regions have more autonomy than provinces, such as the right to declare additional official languages and holidays in additional to Mandarin and other national holidays. Directly controlled municipalities are cities that are not part of any province, and instead report directly to the central government in Beijing. Often having different names, prefectures ((\u5730\u7ea7)\u5e02/\u81ea\u6cbb\u5dde/\u5730\u533a), counties (\u53bf/(\u53bf\u7ea7)\u5e02/\u533a) and townships (\u4e61/\u9547/\u8857\u9053) are one by one subordinated.\nThe Special Administrative Regions (SAR), Hong Kong and Macau, in principle run themselves as separate jurisdictions, with only foreign policy and defense being controlled by Beijing, though in practice this autonomy is restricted. There is an active independence movement in Hong Kong, but the imposition of the National Security Law in 2020 has largely driven the movement underground.\nThe PRC considers Taiwan to be one of its provinces, but Taiwan's government (the Republic of China) has been completely separate from the mainland Chinese one since 1949. Both governments on paper continue to claim to be the sole legitimate government for all of China. There is significant support for formal independence in Taiwan, but China's government has repeatedly threatened to launch a military attack on Taiwan if the island declares itself independent. See Chinese provinces and regions for more detail.\n\n\nPeople and customs\nSee also: Minority cultures of China\nWith 1.4 billion inhabitants, China is home to nearly a fifth of the world's population. It is a diverse place with large variations in culture, language, customs and economic levels from region to region, and often strong distinct cultural and regional identities as well.\nThe economic landscape is particularly diverse. The major cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai are modern and comparatively wealthy. However, about 50% of Chinese still live in rural areas even though only 10% of China's land is arable. Hundreds of millions of rural residents still farm with manual labor or draft animals. Some 200 to 300 million former peasants have migrated to townships and cities in search of work. Poverty has been reduced dramatically, but towards the end of 2016, China still had 43 million people under the official poverty line of \u00a52,300 (about US$334) in annual income. At the other end of the spectrum, the wealthy continue to accumulate real estate and other assets at an unprecedented rate. Generally the southern and eastern coastal regions are more wealthy, while inland areas, the far west and north, and the south-west are much less developed.\nThe cultural landscape is also very diverse. Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group, comprising over 90% of the population, but they are not culturally homogeneous, and speak a wide variety of mutually unintelligible dialects and languages. Many customs and deities are specific to individual regions and even villages. Celebrations for the Lunar New Year and other national festivals vary dramatically from region to region. Customs related to the celebration of important occasions such as weddings, funerals and births also vary widely. The Cultural Revolution wiped out much of traditional Chinese religion, and while it still survives to some extent, contemporary urban Chinese society is largely secular with religion being an undercurrent to daily life. That said, there has been a cultural revival in the 21st century, largely spearheaded by young middle class Chinese, who are now using social media to promote various aspects of their traditional cultures.\nThe other 10% of the population are 55 recognized ethnic minorities \u2014 the largest of which are the Zhuang, Manchu, Hui and Miao (Hmong) \u2014 which each have their own unique cultures and languages. Other notable ethnic minorities include Koreans, Tibetans, Mongols, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Russians. China is home to the largest Korean population outside Korea, and is home to more ethnic Mongols than is Mongolia. Many minorities have been assimilated to various degrees, losing their language and customs or fusing with Han traditions, although Tibetans and Uyghurs in China remain fiercely defensive of their cultures. In some areas, some ethnic minorities, such as the Mongols, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Tibetans, continue to maintain their traditional nomadic way of life, though that is changing as the younger generation gets better access to education and moves to the cities for higher-paying jobs, and even those who preserve the nomadic lifestyle often adopt numerous modern conveniences, such as replacing their horses with motorcycles.\n\n\nLucky numbers\nMany Chinese people like homophones, and several numerals are considered auspicious or inauspicious based on rhymes with other Chinese words. \"Six\" is a good number for business, sounding like \"slick\" or \"smooth\" in Mandarin, and \"good fortune\" or \"happiness\" in Cantonese. \"Eight\" sounds so close to the word for \"prosper\" that it's widely considered auspicious. \"Nine\" used to be associated with the Emperor, and also sounds like \"long lasting\".\nMeanwhile, \"four\" is a taboo for most Chinese because the pronunciation in Mandarin, Cantonese and most other Chinese dialects is close to \"death\"; some buildings skip floors and room numbers that contain 4s.\n\n\nClimate and terrain\n\nThe climate is extremely diverse, from tropical regions in the south to subarctic in the north. Hainan Island is roughly at the same latitude as Jamaica, while Harbin, one of the largest cities in the north, is at roughly the latitude of Montreal and has the climate to match. North China has four distinct seasons with intensely hot summers and bitterly cold winters. Southern China tends to be milder and wetter. The further north and west you travel, the drier the climate. Once you leave eastern China and enter the majestic Tibetan highlands or the vast steppes and deserts of Gansu, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, distances are vast and the land is harsh.\nDuring the communist planned economy era, uniform rules required that buildings in areas north of the Yangtze River get heat in the winter, but anything south of it would not \u2014 this meant buildings were unheated in places like Shanghai and Nanjing, which routinely have temperatures below freezing in winter. The rule was relaxed long ago, but the effects are still visible; buildings in the north are provided with free steam-based central heating by the government, while buildings in the south are not and instead have to rely on private air-conditioning units for heating. In general, Chinese use less heating and less building insulation, and wear more warm clothing, than Westerners in comparable climates. In schools, apartments and office buildings, even if the rooms are heated, the corridors are not. Double-glazing is quite rare. Students and teachers wear winter jackets in class, and long underwear is common. Air-conditioning is increasingly common but is similarly not used in corridors and is often used with the windows and doors open.\nChina has many inland mountain ranges, high plateaus, and deserts in the center and the far west; plains, deltas, and hills dominate the east. The Pearl River Delta region around Guangzhou and Hong Kong and the Yangtze delta around Shanghai are major global economic powerhouses, as is the North China plain around Beijing and the Yellow River. On the border between Tibet (the Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal lies Mount Everest, at 8,850 m, the highest point on earth. The Turpan depression, in northwest China's Xinjiang is the lowest point in China at 154 m below sea level, which is the second-lowest point in the world after the Dead Sea.\n\n\nUnits of measure\nChina's official system of measurement is metric, but you will sometimes hear the traditional Chinese system of measurements in colloquial usage. The one you are most likely to come across in everyday use is the unit of mass j\u012bn (\u65a4), nowadays equal to 0.5 kg in mainland China. Most Chinese will quote their weight in j\u012bn if asked, and food prices in markets are often quoted per j\u012bn. One j\u012bn was traditionally divided into 16 li\u01ceng (\u4e24), but in mainland China it is now 10 li\u01ceng. The modern mainland Chinese versions of these units differ from their counterparts in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, so be sure to know the proper conversions if you are coming from those areas.\n\n\nHolidays\n\nChina observes two week-long holidays during the year, called Golden Weeks. During these weeks, around Chinese New Year (late January to mid-February) and National Day (1 October), hundreds of millions of migrant workers return home and millions of other Chinese travel within the country (but many in the service sector stay behind, enjoying extra pay). Try to avoid being on the road, on the rails, or in the air during the major holidays. If you do have to travel the, plan well in advance, especially for transportation and for travel from western China or the east coast. Every mode of transportation is extremely crowded; tickets are very hard to come by, and will cost you a lot more. Air tickets sell out more slowly because of the higher prices. The Chinese New Year period is the largest annual migration of people on Earth.\n\nChina has seven national holidays:\n\nNew Year (\u5143\u65e6 Yu\u00e1nd\u00e0n) \u2014 1 January\nSpring Festival (\u6625\u8282 Ch\u016bn Ji\u00e9), a.k.a. Chinese New Year \u2014 1st day of the 1st lunar month, late January to mid-February (1 February in 2022)\nTomb-Sweeping Day (\u6e05\u660e\u8282 Q\u012bngm\u00edng Ji\u00e9) \u2014 15th day from the Spring Equinox, 4 to 6 April (5 April in 2022). Cemeteries are crowded with people who go to sweep the tombs of their ancestors and offer sacrifices. Traffic on the way to cemeteries can be very heavy.\nLabor Day (\u52b3\u52a8\u8282 L\u00e1od\u00f2ng Ji\u00e9) \u2014 1 May\nDragon Boat Festival (\u7aef\u5348\u8282 Du\u0101nw\u01d4 Ji\u00e9) \u2014 5th day of the 5th lunar month, late May to June (3 June in 2022). Boat races and eating rice dumplings (\u7cbd\u5b50 z\u00f2ngzi, steamed pouches of sticky rice) are a traditional part of the celebration.\nMid-Autumn Festival (\u4e2d\u79cb\u8282 Zh\u014dngqi\u016b Ji\u00e9\uff09 \u2014 15th day of the 8th lunar month, September to early October (10 September in 2022). Also called the \"Mooncake Festival\" after its signature treat, mooncakes (\u6708\u997c yu\u00e8b\u01d0ng). People meet outside, put food on the tables and look up at the full harvest moon.\nNational Day (\u56fd\u5e86\u8282 Gu\u00f3q\u00ecng Ji\u00e9) \u2014 1 October\nKnown as the Golden Weeks, Chinese New Year and National Day holidays span multiple days; nearly all workers get at least a week for Chinese New Year and some of them get two or three. For many working Chinese, these are the only times of the year they get to travel. Students get four to six weeks of holiday.\nChinese New Year is a traditional time to visit family, and the entire country pretty well shuts down. Many stores and other businesses will close from a few days to a week or longer.\nIn early July, around 20 million university students will return home and then in late August they will return to school. Roads, railways and planes are also very busy at these times.\nMany areas or ethnic minorities have their own festivals. See listings for individual towns for details. Here are some other nationally important festivals:\n\nLantern Festival (\u5143\u5bb5\u8282 Yu\u00e1nxi\u0101o Ji\u00e9 or \u4e0a\u5143\u8282 Sh\u00e0ngyu\u00e1n Ji\u00e9) \u2014 15th day of the 1st lunar month, traditionally the last day of the Chinese New Year, February to early March (15 February in 2022). In some cities, such as Quanzhou, this is a big festival with elaborate lanterns all over town.\nDouble Seventh Day (\u4e03\u5915 Q\u012bx\u012b) \u2014 7th day of the 7th lunar month, usually August (4 August in 2022). This romantic holiday is similar to Valentine's Day.\nDouble Ninth Festival or Chongyang Festival (\u91cd\u9633\u8282 Ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1ng Ji\u00e9) \u2014 9th day of the 9th lunar month, usually October (4 October in 2022)\nWinter Solstice (\u51ac\u81f3 D\u014dngzh\u00ec) \u2014 21 to 23 December (22 December in 2022)\nSome Western festivals are noticeable, at least in major cities. Around Christmas, one hears carols \u2014 some in English, some in Chinese, and one from Hong Kong that goes \"Lonely, lonely Christmas\". Some stores are decorated and many shop assistants wear red and white elf hats. Chinese Christians celebrate services and masses at officially sanctioned Protestant and Catholic churches as well. For Valentine's Day, many restaurants offer special meals.\nEthnic minority regions often have additional public holidays that are not observed in the Han Chinese heartland. For instance, both Eids are public holidays in Xinjiang and Ningxia, Losar or Tibetan New Year is a public holiday in Tibet and the surrounding Tibetan autonomous counties and prefectures, while Songkran, better known in the West as Thai New Year, is a public holiday in ethnic Dai areas like Xishuangbanna and Dehong.\nAround the longer holidays (especially the two Golden Weeks and sometimes Labor Day), surrounding weekends may be rearranged to make the holiday longer. This means that around major holidays, places may be closed when they're usually open or open when they would usually be closed.\n\n\nTime zones\nDespite geographically spanning five time zones, all of China officially follows Beijing Time (UTC+8). However, in the restive province of Xinjiang, while the official time is Beijing Time, some ethnic Uyghurs use the UTC+6 time zone for practicality or as a sign of defiance against Beijing.\n\n\nRead\nWild Swans by Jung Chang (ISBN 0007176155) - a biography of three generations, from the warlord days to the end of Mao's era, illustrating life under China's version of nationalism and communism. This book is banned in China.\nThe Search for Modern China by Jonathan Spence - a standard history book on modern China from the late Ming to the current period.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Chinese phrasebook\n\nThe official language of China is Standard Mandarin, known in Chinese as P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0 (\u666e\u901a\u8bdd, \"common speech\"), which is based on the Beijing dialect; Chinese in general is known as Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n (\u4e2d\u6587). Standard Mandarin is the main language for government and media, as well as the national lingua franca. While the official language is standardized, local pronunciation of Mandarin does vary by region. Unless otherwise noted, all terms, spellings and pronunciations in this guide are in Standard Mandarin. While national media is broadcast in Mandarin, each area often has its own local media that broadcasts in the local language.\nChinese is written using Chinese characters (\u6c49\u5b57, h\u00e0nz\u00ec, lit. \"Han characters\"). Unlike an alphabet that represents individual sounds without any inherent meaning, each Chinese character represents a meaningful syllable: a specific word or part of a word. Although they look impenetrable at first, there is some method to the madness: most characters are composed from base components combined with other characters (often giving clues to both pronunciation and general meaning). The same characters are used in Japan and Korea with usually similar meanings, albeit different pronunciations. However, since the 1950s mainland China has used simplified characters, such as \u9f9f instead of \u9f9c, in an attempt to eradicate illiteracy. Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and many overseas Chinese still use the traditional characters, which are also sometimes used on the mainland as an aesthetic choice. As a result, a word like \"bank\" will be written \u9280\u884c as often as \u94f6\u884c. The simplification was fairly systematic, and you may deduce at least some of the simplifications on your own just from seeing them frequently. Cursive forms of Chinese characters, often used for effect in logos, range from \"looks familiar if you squint\" to \"impenetrable scribbles\".\nThe standard way of romanizing Mandarin is pinyin (\u6c49\u8bed\u62fc\u97f3 h\u00e0ny\u01d4 p\u012bny\u012bn). It's a fairly logical system, although it has a few idiosyncrasies, including using some letters in ways that are different from English (such as q which is similar to English \"ch\" and x which is like English \"sh\"). Mandarin is also tonal, meaning each syllable has to be pronounced with the correct tone \u2014 high, rising, falling-rising, falling, or neutral \u2014 to be understood; tones are marked in pinyin using diacritics that graphically mimic the tones patterns (as in m\u0101, m\u00e1, m\u01ce, m\u00e0, and ma). With just a few hours of practice, you can learn to pronounce Mandarin words accurately using pinyin. However, as Chinese has many homophones, pinyin is useful for pronunciation but not practical for communicating meaning; for something like a street address, you need to use Chinese characters.\nAlthough Chinese is written nearly the same across the country, spoken Chinese has a huge array of dialects, of which Standard Mandarin is just one. Verbally, Chinese dialects are as different from each other as English and Dutch, or French and Italian \u2014 related, but not mutually intelligible. Two people who speak different Chinese dialects read and write the same, but they would pronounce the written text differently, and can't carry on a conversation with each other. However, thanks to heavy emphasis in the education system, most people can comfortably carry on a conversation in Standard Mandarin, though sometimes with a strong accent. In some areas, younger people are more likely to speak Mandarin than dialects, due to previous education policies that prohibited the use of dialects in school.\nA variety of (mainly northern) dialects closely related to the standard are classified as Mandarin and account for the majority of China's population. Other large groups of dialects include Wu (spoken in Shanghai, Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) and Yue (Guangdong), which includes Cantonese (spoken in much of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau). The Min (Fujian) group includes Minnan (Hokkien, spoken in South Fujian and in Taiwan), Fuzhou dialect (Foochow or Hokchiu, spoken around Fuzhou), Teochew (Chiuchow, spoken in Chaoshan) and Hainanese (spoken in the island province Hainan). Hakka is spoken in several parts of southern China but is more related to northern dialects. Like Mandarin, these are all tonal languages.\nMost Chinese are bilingual or even trilingual, speaking Mandarin as well as regional or local dialects. Some who are older or less educated may speak only the local dialect. While you can easily get by in most of China speaking Mandarin, learning a bit of the local dialect is always appreciated, and may get you preferential treatment in shops and restaurants.\nBesides dialects of Chinese, various regions also have ethnic minority languages. The west has Turkic languages such as Uyghur, Kyrgyz, and Kazakh as well as other languages such as Tibetan; the north and northeast has Manchu, Mongolian, and Korean; the south has many other ethnic minorities who speak their own languages. However, except for some older folks, Mandarin is generally usable in these regions and many people are bilingual. In areas with large ethnic minority populations, the relevant ethnic minority language is sometimes co-official with Mandarin, and you may see bilingual road signs.\nChinese Sign Language (CSL or ZGS, \u4e2d\u56fd\u624b\u8bed Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 Sh\u01d2uy\u01d4) is the dominant sign language. There is an official version of CSL standardized by the government. There are also two regional dialects, Southern (from Shanghai) and Northern (from Beijing); these and official CSL are largely mutually intelligible. CSL is not mutually intelligible with Hong Kong, Taiwanese, or Malaysian Sign Languages, nor with any others. Tibetan Sign Language (\u85cf\u8bed\u624b\u8bed Z\u00e0ng y\u01d4 sh\u01d2uy\u01d4) is an independent sign language used in Tibet, not mutually intelligible with any others; it too is standardized by the government based on existing regional sign languages.\n\n\nEnglish\nChinese students study English from primary school to high school, and are required to pass an English test in order to graduate from university. However, the focus is mainly on formal grammar and writing, with less emphasis on reading, and even less on speaking or listening. While a few simple greetings are widely understood, it is generally rare to find locals who are conversant in English.\nStaff at airports, hotels, and popular tourist attractions can sometimes speak basic to conversational English. As China's tourism industry primarily caters to the domestic market, outside major international tourist cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an, even staff at tourist attractions may not be conversant in English.\nWhen using English, simplify and speak slowly. Chinese grammar is much simpler than English, as verbs, pronouns, and other words essentially don't inflect at all. Although it sounds abrupt in English, simple declarative sentences like \"Give me two beers\" are quite similar to Chinese, and thus more readily understood than roundabout constructions like \"Could we have a pair of beers please?\".\n\nWhile English signage or menus are increasingly widespread in China, especially at or near tourist attractions, they are often written in incorrect English. Such signage can be difficult to read, but as \"Chinglish\" follows certain rules, it can usually be deciphered. Oftentimes, translations are simply a word-by-word equivalent of a Chinese expression which, like a word puzzle, can sometimes be pieced together with some thought, but in other cases may be utterly baffling.\nMany places have an English Corner, an informal gathering for practicing oral English, which can be a good way to meet locals. They're often held at schools and colleges on Friday afternoons, and on Sundays in public parks, English schools, and bookstores, and universities. Topics often include cultural activities like holidays and festivals from English speaking countries, such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. However, these have been progressively disappearing over the past decade due to the prolific rise of language exchange over the internet in China, and have all but disappeared in smaller cities.\n\n\nOther foreign languages\nAlthough not as widespread as English, some other foreign languages are of use in China. Korean is spoken as a native language by the ethnic Korean minority in the north east of the country, while Mongolian is the native language of the ethnic Mongol community in Inner Mongolia. Japanese is spoken by some professionals in international businesses. German is a popular language for engineering professionals. Some people in border areas and some older people can speak Russian. Arabic is commonly studied among Muslim communities.\n\n\nGet in\nChina has exceptionally complicated visa requirements. If you are planning to use visa-free entry or transit without a visa, read up carefully and make sure you fulfill all the requirements, or risk being denied entry.  If you're applying for a visa, make sure all your documentation is in order before applying for your visa, or risk being denied if even one required document is missing. That said, the government is keen to attract more foreign tourists and has granted visa-free access to citizens of numerous rich developed countries. Hong Kong and Macau have their own separate visa requirements; see those articles for details.\n\n\nVisa-free entry\nCitizens of certain countries may enter China without a visa for varying durations:\n\nUp to 90 days per 180-day period: Citizens of Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and San Marino (for San Marino, this applies per calendar year).\nUp to 60 days: Citizens of Mauritius.\nUp to 30 days: Citizens of Antigua and Barbuda (up to 90 days per each 180-day period), Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus (up to 90 days per year), Brunei Dominica, Ecuador, Fiji, Georgia (up to 90 days per each 180-day period), Grenada, Kazakhstan (up to 90 days per each 180-day period), Maldives, Mongolia, Qatar, Serbia (per 60-day period), Seychelles, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand (up to 90 days per 180-day period), Tonga, and the United Arab Emirates.\nTemporary exemption until 31 December 2025: Citizens of Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, and Switzerland.\nThe \"up to * days per *-day period\" visa-free entry policy is intended to prevent extended stays in China by repeatedly exiting and re-entering, such as by making visa runs to neighboring countries like Mongolia through the border town of Erlian. For example, in the case of Georgia, the rule allows for staying in China for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day period. This typically requires travelers to leave around day 30 and again around day 60 to avoid exceeding the stay limit. After spending a total of 90 days in China, the traveler would then need to remain outside the country for the rest of the 180-day period before becoming eligible to re-enter without a visa.\n\n\nTransit without a visa\nVisa exemptions are also available for citizens of 54 countries if they are transiting through some cities, to enable you to make short visits to those specific cities. These rules are dizzyingly complicated and subject to sudden changes, so check with your airline shortly before attempting this method of entry.\nCitizens of the designated countries who arrive at one of the designated airports or sea ports in Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Hangzhou, Kunming, Nanjing, Ningbo, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shantou, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Xi'an can stay in the city of arrival for up to 144 hours, in most cases provided they depart from one of the designated airports or sea ports in the same city. The onward ticket must be to a country other than the country from which their arriving flight originated, and they must have the required entry documents for the third country or countries; Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan count as separate countries with regard to this scheme. In Guangdong, Liaoning and Shandong, travelers entering under this scheme may visit the entire province, and may arrive and depart via any designated airport or sea port within the province (so you can fly into Guangzhou and fly out of Shenzhen, for instance, since both are in Guangdong). A similar policy in Guilin, Harbin, and Changsha allows stays of up to 72 hours. Passengers without a visa who intend to leave the transit area will typically be directed by an immigration officer to wait in an office for around 20 minutes while other officials review the passengers' onward travel documentation.\nFor the city of Shanghai and the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, visa-free entries can be done through the airports of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and Ningbo, as well as the Shanghai sea port. Once admitted, passengers can go anywhere within the three province-level units, and must depart within 144 hours (6 days). A similar arrangement applies to the city of Beijing and neighboring Tianjin municipality and Hebei province, where visa-free entry is allowed through the airports of Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, as well as the sea ports at Tianjin and Qinhuangdao. Like the Shanghai area equivalent, passengers can go anywhere in within the three province-level units and must depart within 144 hours.\n\n\nHainan\nCitizens of Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (British citizen only) and the United States may visit Hainan without a visa for up to 30 days, provided they enter and exit Hainan directly on an international flight (including flights to/from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and do not travel outside the province. You will need to register with an approved Hainan-based travel agency at least 48 hours before arrival, and you will need to submit your passport details, roundtrip tickets, itinerary and hotel bookings for each night you plan to stay in Hainan as part of the registration process.\n\n\nCruise ship passengers and tour groups\nCruise ship passengers may visit China without a visa for up to 15 days provided they join a group tour organized by a Chinese travel agency, enter via the cruise ports in Tianjin, Dalian, Shanghai, Lianyungang, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Xiamen, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beihai, Haikou or Sanya, and depart on the same cruise ship. They are only permitted to visit the coastal provinces (i.e. Liaoning, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan) and Beijing.\nCitizens of all countries that maintain diplomatic relations with the PRC may visit 10 cities in Guangdong, namely Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Guangzhou, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, Huizhou and Shantou, without a visa for up to 144 hours (6 days) provided they join an approved group tour from Hong Kong or Macau, and do not travel beyond those 10 cities.\nCitizens of all ASEAN countries may visit Guilin, Yangshuo and Longsheng without a visa for up to 144 hours (6 days) provided they join an approved group tour, enter and exit mainland China via Guilin Liangjiang International Airport, and do not travel beyond those 3 cities.\nCitizens of Russia may visit China for up to 15 days without a visa if they join an approved group tour, with the group size being at least 5 but not more than 50 people. Likely, citizens of Azerbaijan, Moldova and Turkmenistan may visit for up to 30 days without a visa by group tours, although the group size requirements are unclear.\n\n\nVisas\n\nIf you need a visa, in most cases, it must be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate before departure. Visas for Hong Kong or Macau may be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate, but they must be applied for separately from the mainland Chinese visa; there is no visa that serves both mainland China and either of those areas. A single-entry mainland China visa is terminated if you go to Hong Kong or Macau, so ensure that you have a multiple entry visa if you plan to return to mainland China.\nChinese embassies and consulates only issue visas to citizens and legal residents of the countries they are accredited to. If you are planning a trip around East Asia visiting multiple countries, make sure you apply for your Chinese visa in your country of citizenship or residence before leaving for your trip, as Chinese embassies and consulates will not issue visas to short-term visitors in the host country.\nYou must submit your fingerprints during the visa application process. Children under 14, and senior citizens over 70 are excepted. Your fingerprints may also be taken when you enter China.\nSpecial provisions for Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan:\n\nHong Kong and Macau permanent residents of Chinese nationality must apply at the China Travel Service, the sole authorized issuing agent, to obtain a Home Return Permit (\u56de\u4e61\u8bc1 hu\u00edxi\u0101ngzh\u00e8ng), a credit card-sized ID allowing multiple entries and unlimited stay for up to ten years with no restrictions including on employment.\nHong Kong and Macau permanent residents without Chinese nationality can apply for a Home Return Permit (non-Chinese Citizens) which is valid for five years, and allows them to stay in mainland China for up to 90 days each time. They may not work, study or conduct journalism activities while in mainland China.\nTaiwanese citizens are required to obtain a Taiwan Compatriot Pass (\u53f0\u80de\u8bc1 t\u00e1ib\u0101ozh\u00e8ng), a credit card-sized ID that is typically valid for five years, and may live in mainland China indefinitely for the duration of the permit's validity with no restrictions including on employment.\nHong Kong, Macau and Taiwanese passports are not valid for entry to mainland China. Chinese authorities do not recognize British National (Overseas) (BNO) passports. BNO passport holders should use appropriate travel documents (foreign passport/home return permit) to enter China.\nContrary to popular belief, foreigners whose passports contain Taiwanese stamps and visas face no additional restrictions when visiting mainland China.\n\n\nTypes of visas\nTo apply for a tourist visa, you will first need to fill in an online application form on the China Online Visa Application web-site. Once that is done and your form has been submitted, you will need make appointment with the nearest Chinese consulate for an in-person interview, and print out a copy of the form to bring to your interview. Before your interview, you will need to have booked a return ticket to China, and made hotel bookings for each night you intend to stay in China. You must bring printed copies of your air tickets, hotel bookings and a detailed itinerary to the consulate for your interview. You will also need to bring two visa photos and a photocopy of your passport's data page and photo page. If you have previously been issued a Chinese visa, you will need to bring the passport containing your most recent Chinese visa, as well as photocopies of its data page and the visa. If you are a former citizen of China, you are also required to bring along your most recent Chinese passport, a photocopy of data page of your former Chinese passport and current passport side-by-side on the same page, and both the original and a photocopy of your citizenship certificate (of your current country of citizenship). If you are not a citizen of the country you are applying for your Chinese visa in, you will also need to bring proof of legal residence in the country, such as your work or student visa, or your permanent residence card. Your visa will be denied if any of these documents are missing during your interview.\nFor business visas, in addition to the tourist visa documentation requirements, you will need a letter of invitation from the company that will be hosting you in China. For family visit visas, you will need a letter of invitation from the family member who will be hosting you, evidence of your familial relationship with the person (e.g. marriage certificates, birth certificates, etc.), as well as a photocopy of your family member's identity card if (s)he is a Chinese citizen, or passport and residence permit if (s)he is a foreign resident in China.\nTourist visa extensions can be applied for at the local Entry & Exit Bureau or Public Security Bureau (\u516c\u5b89\u5c40 G\u014dng'\u0101nj\u00fa) after handing in the following documents: valid passport, visa extension application form including one passport-sized photo, a copy of the Registration Form of Temporary Residence which you received from the local police station at registration. Tourist visas can be only extended once. Processing time is usually five working days and it costs \u00a5160. See city articles to find out the local bureau.\nSome travelers will need a dual entry or multiple entry visa. For example, if you enter China on a single entry visa, then go to Hong Kong or Macau, you need a new visa to re-enter mainland China.\nObtaining a Visa on Arrival is possible usually only for the Shenzhen or Zhuhai Special Economic Zones, and only if you're arriving directly from Hong Kong or Macau. Such visas are limited to their respective areas, and travelling beyond the respective city boundaries is strictly forbidden. See the respective city articles for details. The rules change consistently, and citizens of developing countries in particular are often denied this visa, so you are advised to get a full Chinese visa in your home country prior to your trip to be safe.\nHolders of a valid APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) except those issued by Canada and the United States may visit mainland China without a visa for up to 60 days provided they do not work in China.\nSee Working in China for information for those who want to work in China, and their family members.\n\n\nRegistering your abode\n\nChinese immigration law requires that hotels, guest houses and hostels register their guests with the local police when they check in. The staff will scan your passport including your visa and entry stamps. In some places, your face may be photographed. Help staff out if they do not know where the most recent stamp is \u2014 immigration officers are sometimes known to stamp in the wrong order.\nIf you are staying in a private residence, you are required to register your abode with the local police within 24 hours (city) to 72 hours (countryside) of arrival, though the law is enforced inconsistently. The police will ask for a copy of the photograph page of your passport, a copy of your visa, a copy of your immigration entry stamp, a photograph and a copy of the tenancy agreement or other document concerning the place you are staying in. That agreement might not be in your name but it will still be asked for. Alternatively, online registration is possible for Beijing, and one may finish the registration process by uploading images of these documents.\nIf you are in China on a long-term visa, you must re-register if your visa or residence permit undergoes any changes, such as extensions, or if you get a new passport. In some cities, you must re-register every time you re-enter mainland China even if your residence permit is still valid; check with your local police station to see if this is necessary.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nThe main international gateways to mainland China are Beijing (PEK IATA & PKX IATA, for all airports BJS IATA), Shanghai (PVG IATA) and Guangzhou (CAN IATA). The explosive growth of commercial aviation in China has led to the proliferation of international gateways to the country. Local governments also frequently subsidize international flight routes serving their cities, so these services may be much cheaper. In particular, Chengdu (CTU IATA), Chongqing (CKG IATA) and Kunming (KMG IATA) are emerging as major Chinese hubs, with flights to destinations in North America, Europe and Oceania.\nAirline tickets are expensive or hard to come by around Chinese New Year, the Chinese 'golden weeks' and university holidays.\nIf you live in a city with a sizeable overseas Chinese community, check for cheap flights with someone in that community or visit travel agencies operated by Chinese. Sometimes flights advertised only in Chinese newspapers or travel agencies cost significantly less than posted fares in English. However if you go and ask, you can get the same discounted price.\nAs of Aug 2024, the Indian government has banned all direct flights between mainland China and India. You must connect via Hong Kong or a Southeast Asian hub like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur or Singapore.\n\n\nAirlines\nChina's carriers are growing rapidly. The three largest, and state-owned airlines are flag carrier Air China (\u4e2d\u56fd\u56fd\u9645\u822a\u7a7a), as well as China Eastern Airlines (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1c\u65b9\u822a\u7a7a) and China Southern Airlines (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5357\u65b9\u822a\u7a7a), based in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou respectively. Other airlines include XiamenAir (\u53a6\u95e8\u822a\u7a7a), Hainan Airlines (\u6d77\u5357\u822a\u7a7a), Shenzhen Airlines (\u6df1\u5733\u822a\u7a7a) and Sichuan Airlines (\u56db\u5ddd\u822a\u7a7a). Chinese aviation regulations allow usage of mobile phones with flight mode when the aircraft is moving, and some larger flights may even offer Wi-Fi. \nHong Kong-based Cathay Pacific can connect from many international destinations to all the major mainland cities. Other Asian carriers with good connections into China include Singapore Airlines, Japan-based Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, South Korea-based Korean Air and Asian Airlines, and Taiwan-based China Airlines and EVA Air.\nMany major carriers based outside Asia fly to at least one of China's main hubs \u2014 Beijing (Capital or Daxing), Shanghai Pudong and Guangzhou \u2014 and many go to several of those. Some, such as KLM, also have flights to other less prominent Chinese cities. Check the individual city articles for details.\nSee Discount airlines in Asia for some additional options both to reach China and to get around within it.\n\n\nBy train\nChina can be reached by train from many of its neighboring countries and even all the way from Europe.\n\nRussia & Mongolia \u2014 two lines of the Trans-Siberian Railway (Trans-Mongolian and Trans-Manchurian) run between Moscow and Beijing, stopping in various other Russian cities, and for the Trans-Mongolian, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.\nKazakhstan & Central Asia \u2014 from Almaty, Kazakhstan, you can travel by rail to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi in the northwestern province of Xinjiang. There are long waits at the Alashankou border crossing for customs, as well as for changing the wheelbase for the next country's track. Another, shorter, trans-border route has no direct train service; rather, you take an overnight Kazakh train from Almaty to Altynkol, cross the border to Khorgos, and then take an overnight Chinese train from Khorgos (or the nearby Yining) to Urumqi. There is also direct train service between \u00dcr\u00fcmqi and Astana (via Khorgos). (Details, in Chinese)\nHong Kong \u2014 several daily high-speed rail services link West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong with Shenzhen and Guangzhou, with one daily service each continuing on to Shanghai and Beijing. There are also overnight high-speed sleeper trains to Shanghai and Beijing four times a week. Both Hong Kong and mainland Chinese immigration checks are conducted at West Kowloon Station, so be sure to factor in extra time for them. The old conventional trains from Hung Hom have been terminated. Alternatively, you can take the MTR East Rail to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau and cross the border on foot. Both border crossings are connected to stations on the Shenzhen Metro on the mainland Chinese side; Luohu in the case of Lo Wu, and Futian Checkpoint in the case of Lok Ma Chau. Shenzhen Railway Station is adjacent to the Lo Wu/Luohu border crossing, making it convenient for transfers to long-distance trains.\nVietnam \u2014 from Hanoi Gia Lam Station to Nanning in Guangxi province, via the Friendship Pass. Alternatively, you can take a train from Hanoi to Lao Cai, walk or take a taxi across the border to Hekou, and take a train from Hekou North to Kunming.\nNorth Korea \u2014 four weekly connections between the North Korean capital Pyongyang and Beijing.\nLaos \u2014 a line was completed from Kunming to Vientiane in 2021. Cross-border passenger trains began operating on April 13th, 2023. The train stops at several stations along the way, including Vang Vieng, Luang Prabang, and Boten in Laos and Mohan, Jinghong and Pu'er in China.\nMacau is not connected to the rail network, but Zhuhai Railway Station is adjacent to the Gongbei border crossing from the Portas do Cerco in Macau, and an extension of the Macau light rail system to the Portas do Cerco is under construction.\n\n\nBy road\nChina has land borders with 14 countries. Mainland China also has land borders with the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which are similar to international borders. Most of the border crossings in western China are in remote mountain passes, which while difficult to reach and traverse, often reward travelers willing to make the effort with breathtaking scenic views.\n\n\nIndia\nThe Nathu La Pass between Sikkim in India and Southern Tibet is not open to tourists, and both countries require special permits to visit. The pass has reopened for cross-border trade since 2006, so the tourist restriction may be lifted in the future.\n\n\nMyanmar (Burma)\nEntering China from Myanmar is possible at the Ruili (China)-Lashio (Myanmar) border crossing, but permits must be obtained from the Burmese authorities in advance. Generally, this would require you to join a guided tour.\n\n\nVietnam\n\nFor most travelers, Hanoi is the origin for any overland journey to China. There are three international crossings:\n\nFrom Dong Dang to Pingxiang (\u51ed\u7965)\nFrom Lao Cai to Hekou (\u6cb3\u53e3)\nFrom Mong Cai to Dongxing (\u4e1c\u5174)\n\n\nLaos\nFrom Luang Namtha you can get a bus to Mengla. You must have a Chinese visa beforehand as there is no way to get one on arrival.\nAlso, there is a direct Chinese sleeper-bus connection from Luang Prabang to Kunming (about 32 hours). You can jump in this bus at the border, when the minibus from Luang Namtha and the sleeper meet. Don't pay more than \u00a5200, though.\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Karakoram Highway from northern Pakistan into Western China is one of the most spectacular roads in the world. It's closed for tourists for a few months in winter. Crossing the border is relatively quick because of few overland travelers, and friendly relations between the two countries. Preliminary customs inspection is done on the spot, while immigration and customs inspection are done at suburban Tashkurgan. A bus runs between Kashgar (China) and Sust (Pakistan) across the Kunerjab pass.\n\n\nNepal\nThe road from Nepal to Tibet passes near Mount Everest, and through amazing mountain scenery. Entering Tibet from Nepal is only possible for tourists on package tours, but it is possible to travel into Nepal from Tibet.\n\n\nMongolia\n\nThere are two border crossings open to foreigners between Mongolia and China:\n\nErenhot (Inner Mongolia)/Zamiin Uud, and\nTakashiken (Xinjiang)/Bulgan.\nOther crossings open to nationals are: Zhuen Gadabuqi or Zuun Khatavch (Xilingol, Inner Mongolia), Bichig (Mongolia), and Sheveekhuren - Sekhee.\n\n\nKazakhstan\nThe border crossing closest to Almaty is at Khorgos. Buses run almost daily from Almaty to \u00dcr\u00fcmqi and Yining. No visa-on-arrival is available so ensure that both your Chinese and Kazakh visas are in order before attempting this. Another major crossing is at Alashankou (Dostyk on the Kazakh side).\n\n\nKyrgyzstan\nIt is possible to cross the Torugart pass from Kyrgyztan, but the road is rough and the pass is only open during the summer months (June\u2013September) every year. It is possible to arrange crossings all the way from Kashgar, but ensure that all your visas are in order.\nAlternatively, while less scenic, a smoother crossing is at Irkeshtam to the south of Torugart.\n\n\nTajikistan\nThere is a single border crossing between China and Tajikistan at Kulma, which is open on weekdays from May to November. A bus operates across the border between Kashgar in Xinjiang and Khorog in Tajikistan. Ensure both your Chinese and Tajik visas are in order before attempting this crossing.\n\n\nRussia\nThe most popular border crossing is at Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia. Buses run from Manzhouli to Zabaikalsk in Russia. There are also ferries across the Amur from Heihe to Blagoveshchensk, and from Fuyuan to Khabarovsk. Farther east, there are land border crossings at Suifenhe, Dongning, and Hunchun. Ensure both your Russian and Chinese visas are in order before attempting the crossing.\n\n\nNorth Korea\nCrossing overland from North Korea at the Dandong/Sinuiju border crossing is fairly straightforward if you have arranged it as part of your North Korean tour. The other border crossings along the Yalu and Tumen rivers may not be open to tourists. Your tour company must ensure that your Chinese and North Korean visas are in order before attempting this.\n\n\nHong Kong\nSee the Hong Kong article for more information on road border crossings into mainland China from Hong Kong. Cycling across the border is not allowed, but you can bring a bicycle across the border; see the Hong Kong article for details on how to do so. \nA visa on arrival is available for some nationalities at the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang crossing if you do not plan to travel beyond Shenzhen, but visas must be arranged in advance for all other crossings.\n\n\nMacau\nThe three border crossings are at the Portas do Cerco/Gongbei, the Lotus Bridge and the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge. A visa-on-arrival can be obtained by certain nationalities at the Portas do Cerco provided you don't travel beyond Zhuhai.\n\n\nOthers\nTravelers cannot cross the borders with Afghanistan and Bhutan.\n\n\nBy boat\nThere are a number of boats to China by sea and river:\n\nHong Kong and Macau: There is regular ferry and hovercraft service between Hong Kong and Macau and the rest of the Pearl River Delta, such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. The ferry services from Hong Kong International Airport allow arriving passengers to proceed directly to mainland China without having to clear Hong Kong immigration and customs.\nJapan: A ferry service to Shanghai from Osaka and Kobe, Japan. Service is once or twice weekly, depending on the season and takes about 2 days.\nSouth Korea: A ferry service to Shanghai and Tianjin from Incheon, a port close to Seoul. Another line is to Qingdao or Weihai from Incheon or Dalian from Incheon.\nTaiwan: Hourly ferries (18 departures per day) run from Kinmen to Xiamen, with the journey time either 30 minutes or one hour depending on port. There is also a regular ferry between Kinmen and Quanzhou with 3 departures per day. A twice-daily ferry links Matsu with Fuzhou, with journey time about 2 hours. From the Taiwanese main island, there are weekly departures from Taichung and Keelung aboard the Cosco Star to Xiamen and Damaiyu, Taizhou.\nThailand: Golden Peacock Shipping company runs a speedboat three times a week on the Mekong river to Jinghong in Yunnan from Chiang Saen (Thailand). Passengers are not required to have visas for Laos or Myanmar, although the greater part of the trip is on the river bordering these countries. Tickets cost \u00a5650.\nCruise ship: In the fall, several cruise lines move their ships from Alaska to Asia and good connections can generally be found leaving from Anchorage, Vancouver, or Seattle.\n\n\nGet around\n\nGoogle Maps does not work in China, and tends to have patchy coverage and data quality even if accessed via VPN. Moreover, China uses its own coordinate system for security reasons, which sometimes causes problems when using foreign map apps. The most common direction-finding app used by the Chinese themselves is Baidu Maps, though it is only available in Chinese. Amap is effectively the Citymapper for the whole of China and is available in English on Apple devices. It lists all public transport and suggested car routes even in seemingly rural places. Apple Maps uses Amap\u2019s data and is reliable, though it lacks certain features that the others offer. Alternative methods include other map apps based on OpenStreetMap data or renting a local GPS. More information at GPS navigation.\nNames of long streets are often given a middle word indicating the part of the street: north (\u5317 b\u011bi), south (\u5357 n\u00e1n), east (\u4e1c d\u014dng), west (\u897f x\u012b), or central (\u4e2d zh\u014dng). For example, White Horse Street or B\u00e1im\u01ce L\u00f9 (\u767d\u9a6c\u8def) may be split up into B\u00e1im\u01ce B\u011bil\u00f9 (\u767d\u9a6c\u5317\u8def \"White Horse North Street\"), B\u00e1im\u01ce N\u00e1nl\u00f9 (\u767d\u9a6c\u5357\u8def \"White Horse South Street\"), and B\u00e1im\u01ce Zh\u014dngl\u00f9 (\u767d\u9a6c\u4e2d\u8def \"White Horse Central Street\"). In some cities, however, these names do not indicate parts of one street. In Xiamen, Hubin Bei Lu and Hubin Nan Lu (Lakeside Road North and Lakeside Road South) are parallel, running east-west on the north and south sides of the lake. In Nanjing, Zhongshan Lu, Zhongshan Bei Lu and Zhongshan Dong Lu are three separate major roads.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nChina is a huge country so, unless you're planning to visit only the eastern seaboard, definitely consider domestic flights. China has many domestic flights connecting all the major cities and tourist destinations. Airlines include the three state-owned international carriers: Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern, as well as regional ones including Hainan Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Shanghai Airlines.\nFlights between Hong Kong or Macau and mainland Chinese cities are considered to be international flights and can be quite expensive. Hence if arriving in, or departing from, Hong Kong or Macau, it is usually much cheaper to fly to or from Shenzhen or Zhuhai, just across the border, or Guangzhou, which is a little further afield but offers flights to more destinations.\nPrices for domestic flights are set at standard rates, but discounts are common, especially on the busier routes. Most good hotels, and many hostels, will have a travel ticket service and may be able to save you 15-70% off the price of tickets. Travel agencies and booking offices are plentiful in all Chinese cities and offer similar discounts. Even before considering discounts, traveling by aircraft in China is not expensive.\nFor travel within China, it is usually best to buy tickets in China, or on Chinese websites (these often have English versions). A useful app/website is CTrip, which is the only way you can use an international credit/debit card on the fly to buy train/plane tickets. If you buy your ticket from a Chinese vendor they will contact you to let you know about changes to your flight. If you purchased your ticket overseas, be certain to check on the flight status a day or two before you plan to fly. On Chinese websites, prices tend to remain high until two months before the flight date, at which point large discounts are usually available unless a particular flight has been heavily booked already.\n\nUnexplained flight delays are common, in part because of the tight military control of the airspace \u2014 few countries have as much of their airspace off limits to civil aviation as China. For short-distance travel, you may want to consider alternatives like high-speed railway. Flight cancellations are also not uncommon. If you buy your ticket from a Chinese vendor they will likely try to contact you (if you left contact information) to let you know about the change in flight plan. If you purchased your ticket overseas, check on the flight status a day or two before you plan to fly.\nDespite a lack of regulation in the late 20th century, the safety record of Chinese aviation is now superb. They did not have a major fatal accident from 2010 to 2022 and Chinese regulatory authorities are very no-nonsense when it comes to safety violations by crews or maintenance problems.\nAlso be sure not to lose your checked baggage receipts, as they will be checked against your baggage tags before you are allowed to leave the baggage claim hall.\n\n\nBy train\n\nSee also: Rail travel in China\n\nTrain travel is the main method of long-distance transportation for the Chinese, with an extensive network of routes covering most of the country. Roughly a quarter of the world's total rail traffic is in China.\nChina now has the world's longest network of high-speed railways called China Railway High-speed (CRH), including the world's only high-speed sleeper trains. If your route and budget allow then these are often the best way to get around. CRH trains are top-notch, even internationally, in terms of equipment and cleanliness.\nOn most higher-level trains, recorded announcements are made in Chinese and English. Local trains do not have announcements in English. Be careful with your valuables while on the train as theft on public transportation is a problem. Motion sickness pills and ear plugs are recommended.\nLong distance trains have a buffet or dining car, which serves mediocre hot food at around \u00a525. The menu is entirely in Chinese. There may be vendors on station platforms who sell noodles, snacks, and fruit at better prices. Most train cars have a hot boiled water dispenser available so you can bring tea, soups and instant noodles.\nSmoking is not permitted in the seating or sleeping areas but is allowed in the vestibules at the end of each car on ordinary trains, while on high-speed trains, it is completely banned. Smoking is forbidden inside station buildings apart from in designated smoking rooms.\nSee Rail travel in China for information on buying tickets. Be sure to bring your ID along, as tickets are tied to your ID, which will be checked both on departure and arrival.\nChinese train stations function like airports, so do not count on catching a train at the last minute: gates close a few minutes prior to departure! To be safe, be there at least 20 minutes early, or 30 minutes if you are entering a big train station. Make sure you're waiting in the right place, because often the train will only stop for a couple of minutes. Chinese trains are generally punctual and follow the posted timetable to a T; if you are late by even a single minute, you will miss the train.\nMany cities have different stations for ordinary and high-speed trains. High-speed railway station and new station names usually consist of the city name and the cardinal direction (e.g. H\u00e9ngy\u00e1ngd\u014dng, \"Hengyang East\") or the district it serves (e.g. B\u011bij\u012bng F\u0113ngt\u00e1i, \"Beijing Fengtai\").\n\n\nBy bus\nTraveling by public city buses (\u516c\u5171\u6c7d\u8f66 g\u014dngg\u00f2ngq\u00ecch\u0113) or long-distance buses (\u957f\u9014\u6c7d\u8f66 ch\u00e1ngt\u00faq\u00ecch\u0113) is inexpensive and ideal for in-city and short-distance transportation.\nCity buses vary from city to city. However, if you can understand the bus routes then they are cheap and go almost everywhere. Buses will normally have recorded announcements telling you the next stop - examples of which might include 'xi\u00e0 y\u00ed zh\u00e0n - zh\u014dng sh\u0101n l\u00f9' (next stop Zhongshan Road) or 'Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei n\u00e1n hu\u01d2 ch\u0113 zh\u00e0n d\u00e0o le' (Shanghai South railway station - now arriving). Some major cities such as Beijing or Hangzhou will have English announcements, at least on some major routes. Fares are usually about \u00a51-3 or more if traveling into the suburbs. Most buses simply have a metal cash-box next to the entrance where you can insert your fare (no change - save up those \u00a51 coins) or on longer routes a conductor that will collect fares and issue tickets and change. The driver usually prioritizes speed over comfort, so hold on tight.\n\nCoaches, or long-distance buses, may be more practical than trains for going to suburbs or smaller cities, though they are fiercely competed and often outperformed by trains. Coaches originating from larger cities on the east coast tend to be air conditioned with soft seats. Bus personnel tend to try to be helpful, but they are much less familiar with foreigners than airline personnel.\n\nA coach or bus in rural China is a different experience. Signs in the station to identify buses will be in Chinese. The coach's license plate number is printed on the ticket, it will be spray-painted on the back of the bus. Scheduled times of departure and arrival are only rough estimates, with the bus leaving when it's full, rather than at a scheduled time. Often, rural coaches are the only forms of transportation in many areas of China and are usually more than willing to stop anywhere along the route should you wish to visit more remote areas without direct transport. Buses can also be flagged down at most points along their route. For expressway buses, you may need to contact the operator in advance, which could let you to board/alight at toll gates. The ticket price the rest of the way is negotiable.\n\nGetting a ticket is straightforward. Large bus stations have ticket counters who sell printed tickets displaying the departure time, boarding gate and license plate number of your bus. You need your passport to purchase a ticket, and often you will have to go through security inspection.\nWithin cities of China, you can now get around China using public transport by paying using China T-union, which is a contactless transport card used in China. Holders of the card can use it to pay public transport fares in any covered service in China, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Shanghai. China T-union tickets are not valid in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.\n\n\nBy subway\nMost major cities in China now have subway/metro (\u5730\u94c1 d\u00ecti\u011b) systems. They are typically modern, clean, efficient, and are still rapidly expanding. Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou already have some of the world's most extensive systems. \nOn station platforms and in trains there is usually signage in Chinese and English listing all stations on that line. Announcements in the stations and trains are made in Mandarin and English, and sometimes the local language. Many maps (especially English versions) may not have kept up with rapid expansion. Look online for a bilingual subway map that you can carry with you.\nChinese subway stations often have a security checkpoint before the turnstiles, where you must run your bags through an X-ray scanner. Pickpockets are most likely to strike during station stops, so pay attention to your belongings.\nStations tend to have numerous exits with labels such as Exit A, B, C1, or C2. On maps you will find each exit is labeled clearly around the station. Signs in the station make it easy to find your exit.\nIn many cities, subways and city buses are moving away from transit cards and towards a WeChat/Alipay-based payment system: a city's transit system will have its own \"mini-app\" within WeChat and Alipay, which you use to scan a QR code to pay your fare. If it works for you, this may be the easiest way to pay for subway rides and local buses for a short term stay.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis (\u51fa\u79df\u8f66 ch\u016bz\u016bch\u0113 or \u7684\u58eb d\u012bsh\u00ec, pronounced \"deg-see\" in Cantonese-speaking areas) are reasonably priced: flagfall \u00a55-14, per km charge \u00a52-3. Most trips within the city center will cost \u00a510-50. There is no extra charge for luggage, but in many cities rates are higher at night. The taxi fee is usually rounded up to the nearest whole yuan. Tips are not expected, but are welcome, especially after long trips.\nTaxis are commonly ordered through a phone app, and it has become harder to hail a taxi on the street. The most popular app, Didi Chuxing, is also available in English.\nTaxi hawkers stalk naive travelers at airport terminals, train stations, and border crossings. They will try to negotiate a set price, and will usually charge 2 to 3 times a metered fare. There are designated taxi areas outside most major airport terminals; insist that the driver use the meter. The fare should be plainly marked on the taxi.\nFinding a taxi during peak hours can be a bit hard. But it really gets tough if it is raining. Away from peak hours, especially at night, it is sometimes possible to get a 10% to 20% discount especially if you negotiate it in advance, even if with the meter on and asking for a receipt.\nSitting in the front passenger seat is acceptable, and is useful if you have trouble communicating in Chinese. Some taxis mount the taxi meter down by the gearbox, where you can only see it from the front seat. Drivers may start smoking without asking. In some cities it is also common for drivers to try and pick up multiple passengers if their destinations are in the same general direction. Each passenger pays full fare but it saves the time of waiting for an empty cab at rush hour.\nEven in major cities, you are very unlikely to find an English-speaking taxi driver. If you are not able to pronounce Mandarin well, have your destination written in Chinese characters to show the driver. Business cards for your hotel and for restaurants are useful for this. In major cities in the prosperous southern and eastern coastal provinces, many taxi drivers are migrants from other parts of China who speak Mandarin but not the local dialect.\nMost drivers are honest and fares are reasonable but there are the bad ones out there who will try to use your lack of Chinese skills to their advantage. The fare difference will usually be minimal. Should you feel you have been seriously cheated on the way to your hotel, and it has a doorman, you can appeal to him or the desk staff for assistance. In cities, photographing the driver's ID (posted on the dashboard) or license plate number and threatening to report him to the authorities can be quite effective.\nIn some cities, taxi companies use a star-rating system for drivers, ranging from 0 to 5, displayed on the driver's name-plate, on the dashboard in front of the passenger seat. While no or few stars do not necessarily indicate a bad driver, many stars tend to indicate good knowledge of the city, and willingness to take you to where you ask by the shortest way. Another indicator of the driver's ability can be found on the same name-plate - the driver's ID number. A small number tells you he has been around for a long time, and is thus likely to know the city better. Use the bigger taxi companies when possible, as the smaller companies tend to have a higher number of dishonest drivers.\nChinese are sometimes competitive when it comes to finding a taxi. The person who flags down a particular car is not necessarily entitled to that ride. Having locals move farther up in traffic to intercept cars or being shoved out of the way while trying to enter a taxi is common. If there are others in the area competing for rides, be ready to reach your car and enter it as soon as possible after flagging it down. Wear your seat belt at all times (if you can find it).\nSome taxi drivers, in particular those who can speak some English, can be quite curious and talkative, especially during peak-hour traffic (\u9ad8\u5cf0 g\u0101o\u200bf\u0113ng).\n\n\nBy bicycle\n\nMain article: Cycling in China\nBicycles (\u81ea\u884c\u8f66 z\u00ecx\u00edngch\u0113) were once the most common form of transportation in China, but were largely seen as a symbol of poverty and abandoned in favor of motor vehicles. However, as of the 2020s, cycling as a hobby is growing in popularity among young middle class Chinese, and numerous cities have dedicated bicycle tracks to cater to that demographic.\nDockless rideshare bikes in China's larger cities operate on a grab'n'go basis: you use your mobile phone to unlock any available bike, pay \u00a51-2 per 30 minutes while using them, and drop them off pretty much anywhere you like. Dockless bikes are built to last, meaning they're heavy, clunky and ungeared, but for travelers, they can be a cheap, convenient, and pleasant means of transport.\nThere are two major dangers for cyclists in China:\n\nMotor traffic; cars and motorcycles frequently pull out without any warning, and in many areas give way signs and red lights are frequently ignored, especially by motorcycles and electric mopeds. Cars are also allowed to turn right on red in China.\nBicycle theft is rampant throughout cities in China, though the situation has improved somewhat with the widespread installation of CCTVs.\nChina is a vast country and it provides serious cyclists with challenges to bike across mountains and desert. Bicycles are prohibited from expressways but otherwise, you can cycle on most rural roads. Cycling through Tibet is possible but foreigners will need to book a biking tour through a local travel agency.\n\n\nBy car\nMain article: Driving in China\nChinese trunk roads are generally of good quality, though the quality of rural minor roads varies drastically between regions. Generally speaking, the quality of roads is best in the coastal provinces, and declines the further west you go.\nThe PRC generally does not recognize International Driving Permits and does not permit foreigners to drive in China without a Chinese license. Hong Kong and Macau licenses are also considered to be foreign and having one of them will not allow you to drive in the mainland. Importing foreign vehicles is difficult. There are some ways of getting a temporary license: see the Driving in China article.\nRenting a car is virtually unheard of in major Chinese cities, which generally have excellent public transportation networks that get you almost anywhere. There are, however, some rural parts of China that are still best explored by car. However, driving habits are quite different from what Westerners might be used to back home. Rental cars most often come with a driver and this is probably the best way to travel in China by car.\n\n\nBy motorcycle\nSee also: Driving in China#Motorcycles\nMotorcycle taxis are common, especially in smaller cities and rural areas. They are usually cheap and effective but scary. The fares are negotiable.\nRegulations for riding a motorcycle vary from city to city. In some cases, 50cc mopeds can be ridden without a driving license although many cities have now banned them or reclassified them due to numerous accidents. Riding a 'proper' motorcycle is much harder, partly because you'll need a Chinese license, partly because they are banned in many cities and partly because production and importing have slowed with the focus on automobiles and electric scooters. The typical Chinese motorcycle is 125cc, can do about 100 km/h and is a traditional cruiser style. They are generally slow, mundane to ride and have little sporting potential. Government restrictions on engine size mean that sports bikes are rare but can still be found. Another popular choice is a 125cc automatic 'maxi' scooter based loosely on the Honda CN250 - it's a bit quicker than a moped and more comfortable over long distances but has the benefit of automatic transmission which makes negotiating stop-start urban traffic much easier.\nMost cities will have a motorcycle market of some description and will often sell you a cheap motorcycle often with fake or illegal license plates, although a foreigner on a motorbike is a rare sight and it will grab the police's attention. Helmets are essential on 'proper' bikes but optional on scooters. You must have a license plate: they are yellow or blue on a motorcycle or green on a scooter and can cost several thousand yuan to register the bike yourself. Fake plates are easily available at a lower price, but are risky.\n\n\nBy pedicab (rickshaw)\n\nIn some mid-sized cities, pedicabs are a much more convenient means of traveling short distances. S\u0101nl\u00fanch\u0113 (\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66), the Chinese term used both for pedal-powered and motorized rickshaws, are ubiquitous in rural China and lesser developed (which is to say, less touristy) areas of larger cities. Negotiating the fare in advance is a must.\nReports of overcharging probably refer to rip-off artists working tourist destinations, like Silk Alley, Wangfujing, and the Lao She Tea House in Beijing in particular. Perhaps the rule of thumb should be, \"Beware of anyone selling anything near tourist traps.\"\nIf you see normal Chinese families using the \"sanlun\" \u2014 for instance, traveling between the Beijing Zoo and the nearest subway stop \u2014 then it's safe. Don't patronise any sanlun wearing some old fashioned costume to attract tourists. He'll try to charge you ten times the going rate.\nElectrified three-wheeled sanluns developed or converted from the pedicabs seem to be in the majority in Shanghai.\n\n\nSee\nChina's attractions are endless and you will never run out of things to see. Especially near the coastal areas, when finished with one city, the next one is usually just a short train ride away.\nWhether you are a history buff, a nature lover or someone who just wants to relax on a nice beach, China has it all from the majestic Forbidden City in Beijing, to the breathtaking scenery of Jiuzhaigou. Even if you live in China for many years, you'll find that there's always something new to discover in another part of the country. Perhaps unsurprisingly due to its sheer size and long history, China has the third largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, after Italy and Spain.\nChina is on the border between two bioregions. Eurasian wildlife can be seen in the north and west, and South Asian wildlife can be found in the south and southeast.\nMake sure you carry your ID around with you in China, as it will be checked at the entrances to ticketed tourist attractions. This is typically your Home Return Permit for Hong Kong and Macau residents, Taiwan Compatriot Pass for Taiwanese citizens, or passport for most foreigners. Tickets for some popular attractions like the Forbidden City in Beijing or the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing must be reserved online in advance.\n\n\nKarst scenery\nThe gumdrop mountains and steeply sloping forested hills with incredible rock formations favored by traditional Chinese artists are not creative fantasy. In fact, much of southern and southwestern China is covered in intricate eroded rock formations known as karst. Karst is a type of limestone formation named after an area in Slovenia. As limestone layers erode, the denser rock or pockets of different stone resist erosion forming peaks. Caves hollow out beneath the mountains which can collapse forming sinkholes and channels leading to underground rivers. At its most unusual karst erodes to form mazes of pinnacles, arches and passageways. The most famous example can be found in the Stone Forest (\u77f3\u6797 Sh\u00edl\u00edn) near Kunming in Yunnan. Some of the most famous tourist areas in China feature spectacular karst landscapes \u2014 Guilin and Yangshuo in Guangxi, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, and much of central and western Guizhou province.\n\n\nSacred mountains\nSee also: Sacred sites of China\n\nMountains are an important part of Chinese geomancy, and there are many mountains which have religious significance in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism. These mountains often serve as a popular backdrop in Chinese period dramas, and have traditionally been associated with various Chinese martial arts sects. Today, these mountains continue to house many Taoist and Buddhist temples, and continue to serve as scenic backdrops that attract many domestic tourists.\n\n\nFive Great Mountains\nThe Five Great Mountains (\u4e94\u5cb3) are associated with the five cardinal directions in Chinese geomancy, and are believed to have originated from the body of Pangu (\u76d8\u53e4), the creator of the world in Chinese mythology.\n\nMount Heng (\u6052\u5c71), the Northern Mountain (\u5317\u5cb3) in Shanxi province. Literally the \"eternal mountain\".\nMount Heng (\u8861\u5c71), the Southern Mountain (\u5357\u5cb3) in Hunan province. Literally the \"balancing mountain\".\nMount Tai (\u6cf0\u5c71), the Eastern Mountain (\u4e1c\u5cb3), in Shandong province. Literally the \"peaceful mountain\".\nMount Hua (\u534e\u5c71), the Western Mountain (\u897f\u5cb3) in Shaanxi province. Literally the \"splendid mountain\".\nMount Song (\u5d69\u5c71), the Central Mountain (\u4e2d\u5cb3) in Henan province. Also home to the famed Shaolin Monastery (\u5c11\u6797\u5bfa), historically famous for its warrior monks. Literally the \"lofty mountain\".\n\n\nFour Sacred Mountains of Buddhism\n\nThe Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism (\u56db\u5927\u4f5b\u6559\u540d\u5c71) are traditionally associated with four different Bodhisattvas, who are revered in Chinese Buddhism. To this day, these mountains continue to be scenic spots with prominent Buddhist temples.\n\nMount Wutai (\u4e94\u53f0\u5c71), traditionally associated with Bodhisattva Manjusri (\u6587\u6b8a\u83e9\u8428), in Shanxi province.\nMount Emei (\u5ce8\u7709\u5c71), traditionally associated with Bodhisattva Samantabhadra (\u666e\u8d24\u83e9\u8428), in Sichuan province.\nMount Putuo (\u666e\u9640\u5c71), traditionally associated with Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (\u89c2\u97f3\u83e9\u8428), the most popular Bodhisattva in Chinese Buddhism, in Zhejiang province. It isn't a mountain, but rather an island off the Chinese coast.\nMount Jiuhua (\u4e5d\u534e\u5c71), traditionally associated with Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha (\u5730\u85cf\u83e9\u8428), in Anhui province.\n\n\nFour Sacred Mountains of Taoism\nAlthough there are many sacred mountains in Chinese folk religion, the Four Sacred Mountains of Taoism (\u56db\u5927\u9053\u6559\u540d\u5c71), together with the Five Great Mountains are considered to be the holiest among them. These continue to be scenic spots that feature prominent Taoist temples.\n\nMount Wudang (\u6b66\u5f53\u5c71), regarded by most Chinese to be the holiest of all sacred mountains for Taoists, in Hubei province. Traditionally regarded to be a major center of Chinese martial arts, and the main rival to the Shaolin Monastery (albeit a friendly one).\nMount Longhu (\u9f99\u864e\u5c71) located 20 kilometers southwest of Yingtan City, in Jiangxi province. Longhu is China's eighth World Natural Heritage Site, World Geopark, National Natural and Cultural Dual Heritage Site, National AAAAA Grade Tourist Attraction and National Key Cultural Relics Protection Unit. Longhu Mountain is a typical Danxia landscape and a birthplace of Chinese Taoism in China, and joined the world geopark network in 2007.\nMount Qiyun (\u9f50\u4e91\u5c71) in Anhui province.\nMount Qingcheng (\u9752\u57ce\u5c71) in Sichuan province.\n\n\nFlowers\n\nWhile Japan's cherry blossoms may be better known, China's plum blossoms (\u6885\u82b1 m\u00e9i hu\u0101) and peach blossoms (\u6843\u82b1 t\u00e1o hu\u0101) are often considered to rival the cherry blossoms in sheer beauty. Plums tend to flower during the coldest part of winter, often during heavy snowfall, making them a symbol of resilience, and is the national flower of the Republic of China that once ruled Mainland China. Peaches, on the other hand, tend to flower in the spring. These trees can be viewed in many parks, particularly in the northern and eastern parts if China, but also at higher elevations in the south. Both flowers are highly revered in traditional Chinese culture, and are frequently featured in traditional Chinese arts and crafts.\nThe peony (\u7261\u4e39\u82b1 m\u01d4 d\u0101n hu\u0101) is also highly revered, and represents honor and wealth. Unlike the plum and peach blossoms, peonies grow on shrubs rather than trees. They typically flower in late spring to early summer.\n\n\nOther sites\nSites of the Chinese revolution can be seen in our Chinese Revolutionary Destinations article.\nSignificant Buddhist sites in China can be found in our Buddhism article.\n\n\nItineraries\nSome itineraries cover trips that are entirely within China:\n\nAlong the Yangtze river\nAlong the Yellow river\nAlong the Grand Canal\nAround Erhai Lake by electric scooter\nHong Kong to Kunming overland\nLong March\nOverland to Tibet\nQinghai\u2013Tibet railway\nYunnan tourist trail\nOthers are partly in China:\n\nSilk Road - ancient caravan route from China to Europe\nKarakoram Highway - Western China to Pakistan through the Himalayas\nOn the trail of Marco Polo\n\n\nDo\n\n\nMassage\nHigh-quality, reasonably priced massages are available throughout China. Hairdresser will often give a head massage, clean out ear wax, and massaging the neck and arms. The availability of foot massage (\u8db3\u7597 z\u00fali\u00e1o) is often indicated by a picture of a bare footprint on the sign.  \nFull-body massage is offered in two varieties: \u00e0nm\u00f3 (\u6309\u6469) is general massage; tu\u012bn\u00e1 (\u63a8\u62ff) concentrates on the meridians used in acupuncture. These three types of massage are often mixed; many places offer all three. Massage is a traditional trade for the blind, and the best value is often at tiny out-of-the-way places with blind staff (\u76f2\u4eba\u6309\u6469 m\u00e1ngr\u00e9n \u00e0nm\u00f3). The most expert massages are in massage hospitals, or general Chinese medicine hospitals.\nSome massage places are actually brothels. Prostitution is illegal in China but quite common and often disguised as massage. Most hot-spring or sauna establishments offer all the services a businessman might want for relaxation. Many hotels offer massage in your room, and additional services are almost always available once she is the room. Pink lighting or lots of girls in short skirts in smaller establishments probably indicates considerably more than just massage is on offer (and quite often they cannot do a good massage either). The same rule applies in many hair salons which double as massage parlors/brothels.\nThe non-pink-lit places usually give good massages and generally do not offer sex. If the establishment advertises massage by the blind, it is almost certainly legitimate.\nFor basic phrases to use when getting a massage, see Chinese phrasebook#Getting a massage.\n\n\nPerforming arts\nMain article: Chinese performing arts\nAs a large and diverse country, China is home to a wide array of performing arts, both traditional and modern. While some genres are popular nationwide, there are also some which are only popular in specific regions, and the various ethnic minorities also have their own unique traditions. Two genres that are popular nationwide, and are also regularly performed internationally are Beijing opera (\u4eac\u5267 j\u012bngj\u00f9) and  Yue opera (\u8d8a\u5267 yu\u00e8j\u00f9).\nChina's pop culture scene has exploded since the 2010s, and today has far eclipsed that of traditional centres Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese pop music, films and dramas are big money business that command a loyal following both locally and among ethnic Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, and most of the top Hong Kong and Taiwanese singers and actors have relocated to mainland China where they can make a lot more money. Talent shows are very popular in China, and often feature aspiring young singers being mentored by a veteran superstar.\n\n\nTraditional arts\nWhen planning an extended stay in China, consider learning some of the traditional arts. Traveling to China is after all a unique chance to learn the basics, or refine already acquired skills, directly from master practitioners in the arts' home country. Many cities have academies that accept beginners, and not knowing Chinese is usually not a problem as you can learn by example and imitation. Calligraphy (\u4e66\u6cd5 sh\u016bf\u01ce), a term that covers both writing characters and painting scrolls (that is, classical landscapes and the like) remains a popular national hobby. Many calligraphers practice by writing with water on sidewalks in city parks. Other traditional arts which offer classes include learning to play traditional Chinese instruments (inquire in shops that sell these as many offer classes), cooking Chinese cuisine, or even singing Beijing Opera (\u4eac\u5267 j\u012bngj\u00f9). Fees are usually modest, and the necessary materials will not exactly break the bank. The only requirement is being in the same place for a long enough time, and showing sufficient respect; it is better not to join these classes as a tourist attraction.\n\n\nMartial arts\nAs with traditional cultural arts, those with the time and inclination may be interested in studying China's famed martial arts. Some, such as tai chi (\u592a\u6781\u62f3 t\u00e0ij\u00edqu\u00e1n), can be studied at a basic level by simply visiting any city park in the early morning and following along. You will likely find many eager teachers. However, learning martial arts to a level that allows you to use them competently in an actual fight requires years of study and training under a master, which often has to start from childhood.\nIn English, Chinese martial arts are often called \"kung fu\" and we follow that usage below. However in Chinese, the general term for martial arts is w\u01d4sh\u00f9 (\u6b66\u8853), while g\u014dngfu (\u529f\u592b, \"kung fu\") is the term for the skill or power that practitioners acquire.\nChinese martial arts are traditionally classified into northern and southern styles, with northern styles generally known for emphasizing powerful strikes with fully extended limbs, and southern styles generally known for fast strikes close to the body. Northern Chinese martial are further classified into two groups named for two mountain areas with monasteries which are centers of kung fu \u2014 Shaolin Temple on Mount Song and the Wudang Mountains. Shaolin are the hard or external styles emphasizing speed and power, while Wudang are the soft or internal styles emphasizing breath control and smooth movement. Of course it is nowhere near that simple; Shaolin experts also move extremely smoothly and a Wudang master has plenty of speed and power.\nOther well-known centers of kung fu include Southern Shaolin in Quanzhou, Fujian, Wu Wei Temple near Dali and Wing Chun (Bruce Lee's style) in Foshan, Guangdong.\nShanghai has a martial arts museum at a Physical Education university.\n\n\nSquare dancing\n\nIn public parks, squares or plazas, or indeed anywhere in a city that isn't fenced off and is large enough (like a parking lot), you will increasingly find, in the early morning and late evening, groups of (mostly) older women doing what looks like low-impact aerobics to music with a dance beat coming from a nearby portable speaker. This activity is called gu\u01cengch\u01cengw\u01d4 (\u5e7f\u573a\u821e), roughly translated into English as \"square dancing\", because of where it takes place (not to be confused with the traditional American folk dance of the same name). It originated in the mid-1990s among women (known as d\u00e0m\u0101 (\u5927\u5988), or \"dancing grannies\" in English) who had just been forced into retirement as a way to stay fit, socialize and recall their own youth during the Cultural Revolution (indeed, many of the songs used are propaganda from that era, or current Chinese pop hits). By 2015 noise and space issues had provoked violent confrontations in some cities and led the government to introduce, then hastily withdraw, standard dance routines. It's interesting to watch at the very least as a modern folk phenomenon, and indeed some groups don costumes and props for their routines.\nSome tourists, particularly Russians visiting Manchurian cities, have joined in. However, this is often frowned upon, as many square dancers compete competitively and are only practicing publicly due to a lack of practice space otherwise. If you are tempted to do so, only join groups that appear to be casually-oriented (no apparent dance uniform or complicated routines) and go to the rear row where beginners follow the leader and learn the moves. You should avoid, or at least practice extreme caution when joining near several groups in a space barely enough for all of them \u2014 turf battles have been known to start and given the novelty of a foreigner participating in square dancing, you may be seen as a final provocation of member poaching.\nBallroom dancing is also moderately common; Western-style square dancing or line dancing are less common but not unknown.\n\n\nTraditional pastimes\nChina has several traditional games often played in tea gardens, public parks, or even on the street. Players often attract crowds of on-lookers.\n\nChinese chess (\u8c61\u68cb xi\u00e0ngq\u00ed) is the world's most-played chess variant. It is similar to but distinct from Korean chess (Korean: \uc7a5\uae30 janggi), but quite different from Japanese chess (Japanese: \u5c06\u68cb sh\u014dgi) and international chess, though they all have enough in common that a good player of one will find another easier to learn. It is a very popular pastime in China, and you can often see elderly Chinese having games with each other in the parks. There are also numerous national tournaments, from school tournaments all the way up to professional ones, and the top players often become major celebrities, with large prizes and numerous TV shows about the game.\nGo (\u56f4\u68cb w\u00e9iq\u00ed, lit. \"the surrounding game\") is a strategy board game. Players place their stones to surround the most territory on the board. While the rules are simple, the strategy and tactics are very complex. There are professional Go players, some of whom are major celebrities, tournaments with large prizes, and some TV shows about the game.\nMahjong (\u9ebb\u5c06 m\u00e1ji\u00e0ng) is popular and almost always played for money. Mahjong uses tiles with a variety of Chinese symbols and characters. Players draw and discard tiles trying to complete a hand with particular sets of tiles. The nearest Western equivalent (not very near!) would be card games like rummy or canasta.\nWhile game play is broadly similar, the rules of mahjong in China differ significantly between regions, and from the Taiwanese and Japanese versions, meaning that you will have to learn new rules everywhere you go. The mahjong played in Hong Kong is Cantonese mahjong, which is the same as that in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong province. The Chinese government has an officially-sanctioned standardized form of mahjong that is used in national and international competitions in an attempt to be fair to people who grew up playing with different rules, though this version is rarely played outside official competitions.\nMany Chinese are skilled at cards (\u6251\u514b\u724c p\u016bk\u00e8p\u00e1i); Deng Xiaoping was renowned for his love for bridge (\u6865\u724c qi\u00e1op\u00e1i).\n\n\nSports\nThe National Games of China (\u5168\u56fd\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a) is a multi-sport event between China's provincial-level units, including Hong Kong and Macau. In addition to the provincial teams, there are also teams representing the Chinese military and various Chinese industry groups. Here you can see some of China's best sportspeople in action, including Olympic gold medallists, as they vie for provincial glory. It is held every four years, in the year after the Summer Olympics, and features all Olympic sports plus wushu. The next National Games will be held from 9-21 November 2025, and will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe official currency of the People's Republic of China is the Chinese yuan, known as the renminbi (\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01 r\u00e9nm\u00ednb\u00ec, \"People's Money\"), denoted by the symbol \u00a5, international currency code CNY. All prices in China are given in yuan; the Chinese character is \u5143 (yu\u00e1n), or in financial contexts (e.g. cheques and banknotes) \u5706. A price may be shown as, for example, 20 \u5143, 20 rmb, RMB 20, 20 yuan or \u00a520; we use the latter form here. In informal spoken Chinese and sometimes in spoken English, \u5757 (ku\u00e0i) may be used instead, much as \"buck\" can be used in the U.S. or \"quid\" in the UK. Some Chinese software will display a bigger \"full width\" character (\uffe5) to differentiate it from the Japanese yen, which uses the same symbol.\nThe Chinese yuan is not legal tender in the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which issue their own currencies. However many businesses will also accept Chinese currency, albeit at an unfavorable exchange rate.\n\nThere are 10 ji\u01ceo (\u89d2) in a yuan. A coin worth \u00a50.1 will thus say \u58f9\u89d2 (\"1 ji\u01ceo\"), on it, and a price like \u00a53.7 would thus be read as \"3 ku\u00e0i 7\". The ji\u01ceo is rapidly heading for extinction, although you will get the odd 1 or 5 jiao coin or note as change. In spoken Mandarin, the ji\u01ceo is usually called the m\u00e1o (\u6bdb). A tenth of a m\u00e1o is a f\u0113n (\u5206); you may see this digit on prices, but it will be rounded off if you pay in cash.\nIn spoken language, the trailing unit may be dropped. For example w\u01d4 b\u01cei s\u0101n, literally \"five hundred three\", means 530 or \"five hundred three tens\". The number 503 would be read as w\u01d4 b\u01cei l\u00edng s\u0101n, literally \"five hundred zero three\". Similarly y\u00ec qi\u0101n b\u0101, literally \"one thousand eight\", means 1800. When using larger numbers, Chinese has a word for ten thousand, w\u00e0n (\u4e07), and thus for example 50,000 becomes w\u01d4 w\u00e0n, not w\u01d4 sh\u00ed qi\u0101n.\n\nCoins: \u00a50.1 (1 jiao; dull silver or shiny silver), \u00a50.5 (5 jiao; gold), \u00a51 (silver)\nBills: \u00a50.1 (1 jiao), \u00a50.5 (5 jiao), \u00a51, \u00a55, \u00a510, \u00a520, \u00a550, \u00a5100\nA lot of Chinese currency will be in the form of bills \u2014 even small change. Bills are more common in some areas, coins in others, but both are accepted anywhere. Even the jiao, at just one tenth of a yuan, exists as both a bill (the smallest) and two different coins. Conversely, one yuan exists as a coin and as two different bills. You should be prepared to recognize and handle either version.\nEven though businesses are legally required to accept cash, mobile payments have become so popular that an increasing number of shops in urban areas do not accept cash or credit cards, and even those that accept cash will often not have any change available.\n\n\nForeign currency\nForeign currencies, including the Hong Kong dollar or U.S. dollar, are rarely seen as a substitute for yuan except in some five-star hotels, and in some shops on the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border, and stock exchanges. Other currencies are unlikely to be used in most transactions. If you only have dollars in your pocket, it usually means that you don't have money to pay the bill without a trip to a bank. Many shops won't accept it, having no idea on exchange rate or how to check if the bills are counterfeit.\n\n\nCounterfeiting\nWith the popularity of mobile payment apps, counterfeit banknotes are less of a problem than before, but you should still be alert for them. Banknotes of \u00a520, \u00a550, and \u00a5100 are the main risks. When you're given one of these bills as change, scrutinize it to check. The main focus is on the texture of different parts, metal line, change of colours under different lights. Everyone has their own method, so just ask.\nWhen you pay with a \u00a550 or \u00a5100 banknote in a shop or taxi, it's socially accepted that you note down the last few digits of the banknote you are handing over. This is in case they claim your banknote is fake, then these remembered digits will ensure they give you the same note back.\nSome unscrupulous money exchangers on the Chinese border areas give counterfeits to travelers. Go to a bank if you're not experienced in checking notes. Major border crossings often have a currency exchange counter run by one of the large banks; these are generally safe to use.\nIt is common for cashiers to scrutinize banknotes and some of the more expensive supermarkets even have machines that can spot counterfeits. This is standard practice in China and offence should not be taken.\nCounterfeits from ATMs are not common, but some people are still concerned. If you are worried, withdraw your money from the bank counter and say \"I worry about ji\u01ceb\u00ec (counterfeit)\". Bank staff are understanding about this.\n\n\nCurrency exchange\nAlthough still restricted, the yuan is readily convertible in many countries, especially in Asia. The Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, pound sterling, Australian dollar, Japanese yen, South Korean won, and Singapore dollar can be easily exchanged in China. Currency should only be changed at major banks (Bank of China in particular), or with the licensed money changers usually found at airports or high-end hotels, although the latter usually offer terrible rates.\nYou should avoid black market for currency exchange as counterfeiting is a major issue, especially with money changers in markets and hanging around large banks.\nForeign exchange is under tight control in China. Private money changers are still uncommon in China. In a bank, it usually takes 5 to 60 minutes to process the exchange, sometimes a little faster in a hotel, though rates at hotels are usually terrible. Bank branches in major cities usually know the procedure and are relatively quick, while even main branches in provincial cities can take much longer.\nYou must fill out a form, and your passport will be photocopied and scanned. Keep the exchange receipt if you plan to leave the country with larger sum of money. Not all banks with the \"Exchange\" logo will exchange money for non-customers or for all currencies in cash. For example, Standard Chartered will only exchange cash for its customers and will only do US dollars and Hong Kong dollars in cash (but opening an account is quick and doable even on a tourist visa, and they offer a better cash exchange rate than most local banks).\nExchanging U.S. currency for yuan can be simple, but expect the bills to be heavily scrutinized before the exchange is processed. Opportunities to buy yuan before entering China, for example when coming overland from Hong Kong or Vietnam, should be taken, as the rates are better. The same is true going the other way \u2014 selling just across the border will often net a more favorable rate. You may only import or export a maximum in local currency of \u00a520,000 in cash, and sums greater than US$5,000 cash in foreign currency require paperwork.\nMost international banks will allow you to get a cash advance via a debit or credit card at a Chinese ATM. However, the rates for such actions are often unfavorable and may include steep service charges. It's useful to carry an international currency such as pounds sterling, U.S. dollars, or Japanese yen to fall back on should you not have access to a cash machine.\nIf you are planning to stay a long time in China, e.g. for work or study, you may want to open a Chinese bank account. See Working in China#Banking for more information.\n\n\nATMs\nMany ATMs will only accept Chinese bank cards. ATMs from three of the big four banks are likely to accept foreign (Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, Diners) cards: Bank of China (BOC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and China Construction Bank (CCB). Although ATMs from other banks are abundant, state they accept Visa/MasterCard/Cirrus and have an English option, they are not likely to work with an international credit/debit card unless the ATM operator is a foreign big-name bank (HSBC, Citibank, Bank of East Asia).\nBefore traveling, find out if your home bank charges a currency conversion fee (often between 0-3%) on such transactions. It is worth opening a zero conversion fee account beforehand if possible.\nIf you have trouble because the ATM requires a 6-digit PIN and your PIN only has four digits, try adding two zeros before it. If you find yourself in a town with a Bank of China branch but no international network-capable ATM, it is usually possible to get a cash advance on a credit card inside the bank for a 3% fee. Just ask.\nUnionPay, the local ATM card network, has made agreements with various ATM card networks around the globe. If your card is covered, any ATM in China will accept withdrawals and balance inquiries from your card. While UnionPay ATM and/or debit cards are now issued by banks in a number of countries, ATM cards linked to NYCE and Pulse in America (also applies to cash advances from Discover cards), Interac in Canada, and LINK in the UK are covered.\nIf your bank is part of the Global ATM Alliance, China Construction Bank is the local partner for fee-free withdrawals.\n\n\nCredit cards\n\nOutside of star-rated or chain hotels, major supermarkets, and high-class restaurants, foreign credit cards like Visa and MasterCard are generally not accepted and most transactions will require cash or mobile payments. Many department stores and large grocery stores have point-of-sale terminals for Chinese bank cards, but most foreign cards are not supported.\nMost Chinese banks and many merchants use the UnionPay system, so a foreign card that supports UnionPay will probably be widely accepted. Several countries now have banks that issue UnionPay credit cards, and UnionPay supports Discover and JCB (Japan Credit Bureau) cards as well. Visa, MasterCard and American Express meanwhile are less common. Most convenience stores take UnionPay, as do most restaurant chains, stores selling high-value items, grocery store chains, and most ATMs. In 2017, it was reported that the new Discover cards with chip would require multiple attempts or did not work at all in most of the POS machines. Do not rely on credit cards as your sole payment method.\nConsider signing up for an international card that can interact with UnionPay. If you have a bank account in Hong Kong then you may be able to open an additional renminbi account with a UnionPay card which is convenient for traveling in the mainland.\nAs with debit cards, Chinese retail clerks will usually present the POS credit card terminal to the cardholder for entry of a PIN for chip-and-pin cards. Visitors from sign-only countries should attempt to explain that fact to the clerk (while chip-and-sign cards will cause most terminals to automatically skip the PIN prompt), and sign the receipt as usual.\n\n\nMobile payments\n\nQR-code based mobile payments such as WeChat Pay (\u5fae\u4fe1\u652f\u4ed8 W\u0113ix\u00ecn zh\u012bf\u00f9) and Alipay (\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d Zh\u012bf\u00f9b\u01ceo) are extremely popular in China. The vast majority of places that take small payments, including restaurants, street-food places, and some public transportation in large cities, accept either or both of WeChat Pay and Alipay. Paying in cash is increasingly inconvenient at all kinds of establishments, and some do not accept cash at all, so a trip to China will go more smoothly if you can get yourself set up on one of these systems (or better, both). Look for a QR-code posted with the App logo of WeChat or Alipay to find places that accept these payment types.\nUnfortunately for the traveler, both maintain strict separation between their Chinese and global networks: you can't use a global account to make payments in China. Getting full access to the Chinese network as a foreigner requires a Chinese bank account, but you can use Alipay with a foreign credit card. As per March 2024, foreign visitors to China can now spend up to $2,000 a year on the Alipay app without registering their ID. Those who do register their ID with Alipay can use the app for single transactions as large as $5,000. The annual transaction limit for those who register their IDs is $50,000. WeChat also accepts foreign credit cards for certain in-app transactions like reloading a prepaid phone balance or ordering delivery \u2013 but requirements are always changing.\nOther NFC-based mobile payments, including Apple Pay and Google Pay, are not accepted in the vast majority of the places. The NFC/Contactless POS terminals usually only takes Contactless UnionPay cards. Even though some stores in large cities are labeled to accept Apple Pay, Apple Pay with a Visa/MasterCard/AmEx/Discover/JCB would probably not work at all in those stores as in most cases they also require a UnionPay card. Google Pay is completely absent from China due to the ban of Google in mainland China.\n\n\nCosts\nChina is affordable for Western visitors, though it's noticeably more expensive than much of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Unless you are heading to Hong Kong or Macau, China is generally much less expensive \u2014 from a traveler's perspective \u2014 than industrialized countries. If you eat local food, use public transportation and stay in budget hotels or hostels, then \u00a5200-300 is a serviceable daily backpacker budget. However, if you want to live an extravagant lifestyle and eat only Western food and stay in luxury hotels, then even \u00a53,000 a day would not be enough. As a general rule, basic items are relatively cheap, but the prices of luxury items are exorbitant, even by the standards of Japan and Western countries. Western-branded products in particular are extremely expensive, sometimes more than double what you would pay for the same items in the U.S.\nThere is a high degree of variation in prices depending on where you go. Major cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou generally cost more than smaller cities and rural, inland parts of the country. The boom towns of Shenzhen and Zhuhai are also more expensive than the national average. Nonetheless, many Hong Kong or Macau residents (who live just across the border from Shenzhen and Zhuhai, respectively, and who are generally more affluent than mainlanders), often go to these cities to shop, play golf, and enjoy services like massage as prices are far lower.\n\n\nTipping\nAs a general rule, tipping is not practised in China. While tipping would rarely be regarded as insulting, in some cases a tip might be seen as suggesting that a relationship is based on money, not friendship. When leaving a tip on your table, it is common to see a waiter chase after you to return the money you \"forgot\" to take.\nIn China, compliments over service is usually expressed in implicit ways. If you are a smoker, you are expected to pass a cigarette to the service staff or manager. If you don't do so, you will be seen as selfish and egocentric. It is common to buy a bartender or pub owner a drink.\nIn a hotel, it is customary not to tip for room service, airport service, taxis or anything else, although hotels that routinely serve foreign tourists may allow tipping for tour guides and associated drivers. Masseurs in some areas such as Shenzhen have been known to ask for a tip. However, if they become pushy at getting tips, most Chinese see this as extortion and an immoral practice, so just be firm if you don't wish to give any.\nTaxi drivers do appreciate a few yuan rounded up if they have made an extra effort for your journey; however, it is by no means required.\n\n\nShopping\nSee also: Shopping in China\n\nShopping has become a national pastime as China's middle class expands. A variety of goods are available to suit any budget.\nIn most brand name shops, upscale malls and supermarkets, the prices already have Value-Added Tax (VAT) and any sales tax included. Thus, anything with a marked price tends to be sold at that price or, perhaps, slightly below especially if you pay cash and do not require a receipt for your purchase. For unmarked goods, there is wide room for bargaining.\nChinese make sales using the character: \u6298 (zh\u00e9) which represents how many tenths of the original price you pay. For example, 8\u6298 refers to 20% off and 6.5\u6298 is 35% off.\nChina excels in handmade items, partly because of long traditions of exquisite artisanship and partly because labor is still comparatively inexpensive. The overwhelming majority of the \"antique\" items you will be shown are fakes, no matter how convincing they look and no matter what the vendor says.\n\nPorcelain: with a long history of porcelain manufacture, China still makes great porcelain today.\nFurniture: in the 1990s and 2000s China became a major source of antique furniture.\nArt and Fine Art: Traditional painting, modern art, and hand-painted reproductions of great works.\nJade There are two types of jade in China today: one type is pale and almost colorless and is made from a variety of stones mined in China. The other type is green in color and is imported from Myanmar (Burma) - if genuine!\nCarpets: China is home to a remarkable variety of carpet-making traditions, including Mongolian, Ningxia, Tibetan and modern types.\nPearls & pearl jewellery: cultured Akoya and freshwater pearls are mass-produced and sold at markets across China.\nOther arts and crafts: Cloisonn\u00e9 (colored enamels on a metal base), lacquer work, opera masks, kites, shadow puppets, Socialist-realist propaganda posters, wood carvings, scholar's rocks (decorative rocks, some natural, some less so), paper-cuts, and so on.\nClothing: China is one of the world's leading manufacturers of clothing, shoes and accessories. There are affordable tailors anywhere in China. There is also traditional Chinese clothing if you are interested, and a growing revival movement. The styles that Westerners are most familiar with are the cheongsam (\u957f\u886b ch\u00e1ngsh\u0101n; ch\u00e8uhng-s\u0101am in Cantonese) or qipao (\u65d7\u888d q\u00edp\u00e1o) for women, and the tangzhuang (\u5510\u88c5 t\u00e1ngzhu\u0101ng) for men, which were based on traditional Manchu clothing that was imposed on the Han Chinese during the Qing Dynasty. Traditional Han Chinese clothing from the Ming Dynasty and earlier is known as the hanfu (\u6c49\u670d h\u00e0nf\u00fa); it looks superficially similar to the Japanese kimono and Korean hanbok, and is often mistaken for one of those.\nBrand-name goods: genuine branded foreign goods won't be cheaper than in Western countries. There are a number of sources of potential knock-offs or fake brand-name goods.\nSoftware, music and movies: Most CDs (music or software) and DVDs in China are unauthorized copies.\nEndangered species: avoid purchasing \u2014 coral, ivory and parts from endangered animal species. Anyone buying such products risks substantial fines and/or jail time either when trying to leave China with them or when trying to import them into another country.\nElectronics: Since the 2010s, Chinese companies have been pushing the boundaries of innovation in consumer electronics. In particular, they have become the world leader in the design and manufacturing of drones for photography. Shenzhen is particularly famous for its electronics markets.\n\n\nBargaining\nSee also: Shopping in China#Bargaining, Bargaining\n\nBargaining is a national pastime in China. You can bargain over almost anything, and sometimes it's even possible to ask for discount in a restaurant at the last minute before paying the bill. Many restaurants or bars will willingly offer a free dish or two (such as a fruit plate in a KTV) if you have made a particularly large order. Shopping malls are less willing to bargain, but why not ask \"Will I get a gift?\"\nPrices are almost always posted, but they are all substantially marked up, normally 2-3 times. It's often better to buy souvenirs somewhere just a few blocks away from the tourist spots.\nIt is hard to tell what price to offer when starting negotiations. Depending on the city, product or market in question, 5% to 50% of the posted price or vendor's first offer is common. If someone offers you too-great-to-be-true discount, it could be a sign that the goods are of less-than-great quality. The rule of thumb is to walk around and compare. In tourist spots, it's common to ask for a 30-50% discount, but in a place catering to local people, asking for a 50% discount sounds foolish.\nIn tourist places, don't take what merchants say seriously. When you ask for a 50% discount, they may be appalled and show scorn; it's a favorite drama.\n\n\nBasics\nUnless you have a supermarket within walking distance of your hotel (see next section below), the most convenient option for basic supplies and groceries will almost always be a convenience store. Major chains in China include Kedi, Alldays, FamilyMart and 7-Eleven. China has belatedly caught up with East Asia's love affair with convenience stores, to the point where the largest cities like Beijing and Shanghai have become oversaturated with them.\nMany convenience stores sell individual tissue packets, which are a necessity for touring China as many public restrooms do not have toilet paper. Although supermarkets also sell tissue packets and toilet paper, they tend to sell it in 6 or 10-packs which are too much for tourists (the ones that sell individual packs will have them close to or at the tills).\nSome discount and mid-market department stores in China also have groceries sections.\n\n\nWestern goods\nSee also: Shopping in China#Brand-name goods\nAreas with large expatriate communities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen have specialty grocery stores catering to those communities. These are often no larger than a 7-Eleven. They usually stock imported snacks, alcohol, and specialty groceries such as meats and cheeses and are often very expensive. See individual articles for details.\nSeveral Western-owned supermarket chains are widespread in China \u2013 American Wal-mart (\u6c83\u5c14\u739b W\u00f2'\u011brm\u01ce), German Metro (\u9ea6\u5fb7\u9f99 M\u00e0id\u00e9l\u00f3ng), and French Carrefour (\u5bb6\u4e50\u798f Ji\u0101l\u00e8f\u00fa). All have some Western groceries \u2013 often at high prices. However, the availability of foreign products diminishes at their branches according to the size of the city. Metro is probably the best of these; in particular it usually has a fine selection of alcohol. Asian-owned chains include Japanese AEON (\u6c38\u65fa Y\u01d2ngw\u00e0ng), Taiwanese RT-Mart (\u5927\u6da6\u53d1 D\u00e0r\u00f9nf\u0101), South Korean LOTTE Mart (\u4e50\u5929\u739b\u7279 Letianmate) and Filipino SM; these also carry imported goods. Some larger Chinese chains such as Beijing Hualian (\u5317\u4eac\u534e\u8054 B\u011bij\u012bng Hu\u00e1li\u00e1n) also carry a limited selection of foreign products.\n\n\nTobacco\nSee also: Shopping in China#Tobacco\nMain article: Tobacco\nSmoking is quite common and cigarettes (\u9999\u70df xi\u0101ngy\u0101n) are generally cheap. Cigarettes can be purchased from small neighbourhood stores, convenience stores, counters in supermarkets and in department stores. Rolling tobacco and papers are rare in urban China. Lighters (\u6253\u706b\u673a d\u01cehu\u01d2j\u012b) are usually cheap (about \u00a51) but flimsily made. Zippos are available but expensive.\nSmoking is something of a social activity in China. In a bar or at dinner few Chinese will light up without offering cigarettes around the table, or at least to the men since few Chinese women smoke; visitors should do the same. Having an expensive brand is a status symbol.\n\n\nEat\nMain article: Chinese cuisine\n\nFood in China varies widely between regions, so the term \"Chinese food\" is a blanket term, about as descriptive as \"Western food.\" Still, there are some broad characteristics. Gastronomy has a long history in China, and dishes subtly balance many flavors, aromas, and colors. Each region developed cuisine and techniques based on the ingredients at hand, so you'll find spicy meat-filled dishes in cooler inland regions, slowly simmered seafood stews in coastal regions, quickly stir-fried fresh vegetables in busy southern ports like Guangzhou, and simple and hearty meat dishes in the Northeast with its notoriously harsh winters. Even many native Chinese find food from outside their home region to be \"foreign\".\nIn southern China, rice (\u7c73\u996d m\u01d0f\u00e0n) is a staple food served with many meals, so much so that its root word \u996d (f\u00e0n) means \"meal\" as well as \"cooked grain\". It may be served plain (eaten by itself as a side, or used as a bed to soak up sauce from the main dish), stir-fried with a variety of ingredients to make fried rice, a quick tasty street meal and a common way to use up leftovers at home, or made into congee (\u7ca5 zh\u014du), rice porridge that's a common breakfast. Noodles (\u9762 mi\u00e0n) are another important staple, made from either rice or wheat, and served in a variety of methods. Soybeans are used to make soy sauce, a quintessential seasoning in Chinese cooking. They're also used to make tofu (\u8c46\u8150 d\u00f2ufu), which comes in many forms besides tasteless white blocks: some can be as flavorful and crispy as meat, others quite pungent like a blue cheese.\nChinese gourmands place emphasis on freshness so your meal will most likely be cooked as soon as you order it. Searing hot woks over coal or gas fires make even street food usually safe to eat. Indeed freshly prepared street food is often safer than food sitting on the buffet lines of 5-star hotels. Still, use common sense: if it's a searing hot summer day and the kebab vendor has their raw meat sitting unrefrigerated on the counter, you might want to head elsewhere.\nVarious types of Chinese food provide quick, cheap, tasty, light meals. Street food and snacks sold from portable vendors can be found throughout China's cities, good for breakfast or a snack. And Western-style fast food is arguably as popular as the domestic variety.\nYelp and TripAdvisor are virtually unknown in China, while the Michelin Guide only covers Shanghai and Guangzhou, and is not taken seriously by most Chinese people. Instead, most Chinese people rely on Dazhong Dianping for restaurant ratings, but the downside is that it is only available in Chinese.\n\n\nEtiquette\nSee also: Chinese cuisine#Respect\nChina is the birthplace of chopsticks (\u7b77\u5b50 ku\u00e0izi), which are used for most Chinese food. Chinese cuisine evolved to be eaten using chopsticks, with almost all food prepared in bite-sized chunks or easily picked apart. Eating with chopsticks is a surprisingly easy skill to pick up, although mastering them takes a while. Some chopstick guidelines to be aware of:\n\nNever place or leave chopsticks upright in a bowl of food (reminiscent of funeral rites), pass something from your chopsticks to another person's chopsticks (another funeral rite), or drum your bowl with chopsticks (reminiscent of beggars).\nAlways use chopsticks as a pair, like a set of tongs; never use just one chopstick at a time (nor one in each hand), hold them in your fist like you would a knife or dagger, or try to \"cut\" food with them like you would with a knife. Spearing food with your chopsticks is generally rude and should be done only as a last resort.\nUsing chopsticks to move plates or bowls is rude.\nPointing at things with your chopsticks is rude. (Pointing at people in general is rude; with chopsticks, doubly so.) Even when setting chopsticks down on the table, angle them so they're not pointing at anyone.\nIn general, try not to touch food with your fingers. Even fried chicken is picked up with chopsticks and gingerly nibbled, touching it as little as possible. Small bones should be spat onto your plate or bowl, rather than removed using your hands or chopsticks. For foods that are eaten with your hands, disposable plastic gloves may be provided.\nIt's normal to pick up any bowl of food for easier eating, and you can put a bowl of rice directly to your mouth to push the last few bites in using your chopsticks. Spoons are used for soups and porridge, and to help with eating noodles in a soup.\nIn traditional Chinese dining, dishes are shared family style, and at larger tables there is usually a lazy Susan to pass dishes around.\n\nCommunal chopsticks (\u516c\u7b77 g\u014dngku\u00e0i) are not always provided; if not, just use your own chopsticks to transfer food to your bowl. It's not rude to request communal chopsticks from the restaurant, but it may make you look like a stickler for formality.\nEach communal dish should only be served from by one person at a time. Don't reach across someone to reach a farther dish while they're serving; wait until they're done.\nOnce you put something on your plate, don't put it back. Confucius says never leave someone else with what you don't want.\nDo not start eating until the most senior person at the table has started eating.\nDon't expect to get a fortune cookie with your meal; that's strictly a Western custom. (Fortune cookies were actually invented in California sometime in the early 20th century.) Most Chinese have never even heard of them.\n\n\nRegional cuisines\nSee also: Chinese cuisine#Regional cuisines\nSeveral varieties of Chinese food have enough international popularity that you may already recognize some of them:\n\nCantonese cuisine (from Guangdong), is by far the most widely known type of Chinese food abroad. Neither bland nor spicy, Cantonese cuisine will use almost anything as an ingredient, often preserving the freshness by quickly stir-frying in a very hot wok or steaming. Dim sum, siu mei (roast meats, including roast duck, crispy skin roast pork, char siu, etc.), claypot rice with Chinese sausage and wonton noodles are among the most famous Cantonese dishes.\nHuaiyang cuisine (from the eastern area towards Shanghai) is considered a good mix of northern and southern Chinese cooking styles. Dishes tend to focus on a main ingredient, which is often seafood in this coastal region; flavors are often sweet, and almost never spicy. Its most famous dishes include xiaolongbao (soup dumplings), red braised pork belly, drunken chicken, and sweet and sour mandarin fish.\nSichuan or Szechuan cuisine (from the western inland) is popular with many foreigners for its m\u00e1l\u00e0 flavors, using Sichuan peppercorns for a tingling numbness (m\u00e1) and chili peppers for spiciness (l\u00e0). Using lots of meat, preserved foods, and chili oil, it's famous for the original form of Kung Pao chicken, mapo tofu, twice-cooked pork, and dandan noodles.\nTeochew cuisine (from the Chaoshan region of Guangdong) is well known in Hong Kong and much of Southeast Asia. Particularly known for its braised meats and steamed dishes.\nOther major traditional cuisines include fragrant and vinegary Shandong, tender Fujian, spicy Hunan, herbal Anhui, and delicate Zhejiang. Ethnic minority cuisines in China include Korean, Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian, and various cuisines from Yunnan, while Northeastern Chinese cuisine is influenced by both Mongolian and Russian cuisines and includes dishes like potato dumplings and a type of borscht. There is even unique Chinese-style Western food to be found in Shanghai and Harbin.\n\n\nDietary restrictions\nSee also: Chinese cuisine#Dietary restrictions\nPeople with dietary restrictions will have a hard time in China. Halal food is hard to find outside areas with a significant Muslim population, but look for Lanzhou noodle (\u5170\u5dde\u62c9\u9762, L\u00e1nzh\u014du l\u0101mi\u00e0n) restaurants, which may have a sign advertising \"halal\" in Arabic (\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0644) or Chinese (\u6e05\u771f q\u012bngzh\u0113n). Alternatively, Uyghur cuisine is growing in popularity, and every major city in China will have at least one Uyghur-operated kebab stand selling lamb kebabs (\u7f8a\u8089\u4e32 y\u00e1ng r\u00f2u chu\u00e0n) and naan (\u9995 n\u00e1ng). If you are attending university in China, most major Chinese universities have halal canteens to cater to their Muslim students. Kosher food is nearly unknown, and you will have to do some advance planning; there are Chabad houses in major Chinese cities that you can contact to help with this. Vegetarian restaurants can often be found near major Buddhist temples (look for the character \u7d20 (s\u00f9) or the symbol \u534d, a Buddhist symbol in this context), but elsewhere you'll probably need to ask specifically and it may not always be available. Dairy and eggs are little-used in Chinese vegetarian cuisine, so much of it is suitable for vegans, but do pay attention, especially when it comes to desserts. Be careful in ordinary restaurants though, as vegetable and tofu dishes can include non-vegetarian ingredients such as oyster sauce, salted fish, dried shrimp or minced pork. Awareness of food allergies (\u98df\u7269\u8fc7\u654f sh\u00edw\u00f9 gu\u00f2m\u01d0n) is limited, and gluten-free foods are virtually non-existent.\nPork is the most popular meat in China, so if you see the character for meat (\u8089) without any other qualifiers (e.g. \u725b\u8089 for beef, \u9e21\u8089 for chicken, or \u7f8a\u8089 for mutton), assume it is pork.\n\n\nDrink\nThe Chinese love a tipple, but unless you are used to imbibing heavily, be careful when drinking with Chinese. The Chinese liquor b\u00e1iji\u01d4 is quite potent (up to 65% alcohol); it's often drunk in small shot glasses for a good reason. When U.S. President Richard Nixon \u2014 who was an experienced drinker, if a bit of a lightweight \u2014 first visited China, his staff sent dire warnings that he not drink in response to toasts. (He diplomatically managed to toast every table at the banquet, taking very small sips.) The drinking culture in northern China is significantly stronger than that of southern China.\nThere are hardly any liquor laws in China. The legal drinking age is 18, but it's basically not enforced, and you'll never need to show ID. Alcohol can be purchased anywhere and drunk anywhere.\n\n\nToasting\nToasts are made by saying \"g\u0101nb\u0113i\" (\u5e72\u676f, lit. \"dry glass\"). Drinks are served in small glasses (even beer is usually drunk from oversized shot glasses), and traditionally you should drain the whole glass for a toast.\nChinese toasts are generally one-on-one, not something involving the whole table. At most meals, a visitor can expect everyone at the table to offer them a toast. Visitors should also offer toasts and not just receive them. This means that if you are out for dinner with a dozen people, you will be expected and pressured to drink around two dozen toasts. Fortunately, it's okay to stick to beer, and Chinese beer is usually low alcohol.\nIt may be considered rude if you don't offer a toast to someone whenever you take a drink, at least at the start of a meal. The same applies to smoking; offer the pack around whenever you want to light up.\nIf you want to take it easy but still be sociable, say \"'su\u00edbi\u00e0n\" (\u968f\u4fbf) or \"p\u00e8ngbe\u012b\" (\u78b0\u676f) before you make the toast, then drink only part of the glass. It may also be possible to have three toasts (traditionally signifying friendship) with the entire company, rather than a separate toast for each person.\n\n\nAlcohol\nSee also: Chinese cuisine#Alcoholic\nThe all-purpose word ji\u01d4 (\u9152, \"alcohol\") covers quite a range of alcoholic drinks. Generally speaking, heavy drinking is more prevalent in northern China than in southern China.\nBeer (\u5564\u9152 p\u00edji\u01d4) is common in China and is served in nearly every restaurant and sold in many grocery stores. The most famous brand is Tsingtao (\u9752\u5cf6 Q\u012bngd\u01ceo) from Qingdao, which was at one point a German concession.\nLocally made grape wine (\u8461\u8404\u9152 p\u00fat\u00e1oji\u01d4) is common and much of it is reasonably priced, but usually bears only the faintest resemblance to Western wines. The Chinese like their wines red and very sweet, and they're typically served over ice or mixed with Sprite. That said, higher-quality local wines that are more similar to their Western counterparts also exist, if you know what to look for.\nThere are also several brands and types of rice wine. Most of these resemble a watery rice pudding, they are usually sweet and contain a minute amount of alcohol for taste.\nBaijiu (\u767d\u9152 B\u00e1iji\u01d4) is distilled liquor, generally 40% to 60% alcohol by volume, made from sorghum and sometimes other grains depending on the region. Maotai or Moutai (\u8305\u53f0 M\u00e1ot\u00e1i), from the eponymous town in Guizhou Province, is China's national liquor. Maotai and its expensive cousins (such as Kaoliang from Kinmen in Taiwan) are well known for their strong fragrance and are actually sweeter than western clear liquors as the sorghum taste is preserved \u2014 in a way.\nChinese brandy (\u767d\u5170\u5730 b\u00e1il\u00e1nd\u00ec) is excellent value, priced about the same as wine. There are several brands; all are drinkable and many visitors find them more palatable than baijiu.\nThe Chinese are also great fans of various supposedly medicinal liquors, which usually contain exotic herbs and/or animal parts. Some of these have prices in the normal range and include ingredients like ginseng, while other more exotic may include snakes, wasps and newborn mice. These can be palatable enough, if tending toward sweetness. Note that some medicinal liquors are only intended for external use.\n\n\nBars, discos and karaoke\nWestern style pubs are becoming increasingly popular across the country. Especially in the more affluent urban centers such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou one can find painstakingly recreated replicas of traditional Irish or English pubs. Like their Western counterparts most will have a selection of foreign beers on tap as well as provide pub food (of varying quality) and often feature live cover bands. Most of these pubs cater to and are frequented by the expatriate communities so you should not expect to find many Chinese in these places. Imported beer can be very expensive compared to local brew.\nTo just go out for a few drinks with friends, pick a local restaurant and drink beer at around \u00a55 for a 600 ml bottle. It will be Chinese lager, around 3% alcohol, with a limited choice of brand and may be served warm. Most mid- to high- range restaurants will have small private suites for gatherings (usually offered free if there is more than around 5 people), and the staff will generally not try to hustle you out even if you decide to stay until closing time. Many residents frequent outdoor restaurants or roadside stalls and barbecues (\u70e7\u70e4 sh\u0101ok\u01ceo) for a nice and inexpensive evening.\nIn discos and fancy bars with entertainment, you normally buy beer \u00a5100 at a time; this gets you anywhere from 4 import-brand beer (Heineken, Bud, Corona, Sol, etc.) to 10 local beers. A few places offer cocktails; fewer have good ones.\nOther drinks are sold only by the bottle, not by the glass. Red wine is in the \u00a580-200 range (served with ice and Sprite) and mediocre imported whiskeys (Chivas, Johnny Walker, Jim Beam, Jack Daniels; extremely rarely single malts) and cognacs, \u00a5300-800. Both are often mixed with sweet bottled green or red tea. Vodka, tequila and rum are less common, but sometimes available. Bogus \"brand name\" products are fairly common and may ruin your next day.\nThese places often have bar girls, young women who drink a lot and want to play drinking games to get you to consume more. They get a commission on whatever you buy. In general, these girls will not leave the bar with you; they are professional flirts, not prostitutes.\n\nKaraoke (\u5361\u62c9OK k\u01cel\u0101'\u014duk\u00e8i) is huge in China and can be broadly split into two categories. More common is the no-frills karaoke box or KTV, where you rent a room, bring your friends and the house gives you a mic and sells you booze. Much favored by students, these are cheap and fun with the right crowd, although you need at least a few people for a memorable night. Bringing your own booze can keep the price tag down but must be done on the sly - many places have windows in the door so the staff can make sure you only drink liquor they sold to you.\nRather different is the distinctly dodgier special KTV lounge, more oriented to businessmen entertaining clients or letting their hair down, where the house provides anything and everything at a price. At these often opulent establishments \u2014 over-the-top Roman and Egyptian themes are standard \u2014 you'll be joined by short-skirted professional karaoke girls, who charge by the hour for the pleasure of their company and whose services may not be limited to just singing badly and pouring your drinks. It's highly advisable not to venture into these unless you're absolutely sure somebody else is footing the bill, which can easily run into hundreds of dollars even if you keep your pants on.\nAs elsewhere, never never accept an invitation to a restaurant or bar from an available-looking woman who just picked you up in the street sometime after sundown. At best, suggest a different place. If she refuses, drop her on the spot. More than likely, she will steer you into a quiet little place with too many doormen and you will find yourself saddled with a modest meal and beer that will cost you \u00a51,000 or worse. And the doormen won't let you leave till you pay up.\n\n\nTea\nChina is the birthplace of tea culture, and at the risk of stating the obvious, there's a lot of tea (\u8336 ch\u00e1) in China. Green tea (\u7eff\u8336 l\u01dcch\u00e1) is served up for free in some restaurants (depending on region) or for a small fee. For more information, see Chinese cuisine#Tea.\nThe most common types served are:\n\ngunpowder tea (\u73e0\u8336 zh\u016b ch\u00e1): a green tea named after the appearance of the bunched-up leaves used to brew it\njasmine tea (\u8309\u8389\u82b1\u8336 m\u00f2l\u00echu\u0101 ch\u00e1): green-tea scented with jasmine flowers\noolong (\u70cf\u9f8d w\u016bl\u00f3ng): a half-fermented mountain tea.\nSpecialist tea houses serve a vast variety of brews, ranging from the pale, delicate white tea (\u767d\u8336 b\u00e1ich\u00e1) to the powerful fermented and aged pu'er tea (\u666e\u6d31\u8336 p\u01d4'\u011brch\u00e1). Most tea shops will be more than happy to let you sit down and try different varieties of tea. \"Ten Fu Tea\" is a national chain.\nChinese teas are drunk without sugar or milk. However, in some areas you will find Hong Kong style \"milk tea\" (\u5976\u8336 n\u01ceich\u00e1) or Tibetan \"butter tea\". Taiwanese bubble tea (\u73cd\u73e0\u5976\u8336 zh\u0113nzh\u016b n\u01ceich\u00e1) is also popular; the \"bubbles\" are balls of tapioca and milk or fruit are often mixed in.\n\n\nCoffee\nCoffee (\u5496\u5561 k\u0101f\u0113i) is popular in urban China, though it can be quite difficult to find in smaller towns. Several chains of coffee shops have branches in many cities, including Starbucks (\u661f\u5df4\u514b), UBC Coffee (\u4e0a\u5c9b\u5496\u5561), Ming Tien Coffee Language and SPR. The most popular coffee shop chain in China is local brand Luckin Coffee (\u745e\u5e78\u5496\u5561), which has taken the country by storm and has more branches than Starbucks nationwide. There are many small independent coffee shops or local chains.\n\n\nCold drinks\nMany drinks that are usually served chilled or with ice in the West are served at room temperature in China. Ask for beer or soda in a restaurant, and it may arrive at room temperature, though beer is more commonly served cold, at least in the summer. Water will generally be served hot. That is actually good, because only boiled (or bottled) water is safe to drink.\nSmall grocery stores and restaurants sell cold drinks, just look for the cooler (even though it might not actually be cool). You can try bringing a cold beverage into a restaurant. Most small restaurants won't mind\u2014if they even notice\u2014and there is no such thing as a \"cork\" charge in China. Most people will be drinking tea, which is free anyway, so the restaurant is probably not expecting to profit on your beverage consumption.\nAsking for ice is best avoided. Many, perhaps most, places just don't have it. The ice they do have may well be made from unfiltered tap water and arguably unsafe for travelers sweating bullets about diarrhea.\n\n\nSleep\n\nAvailability of accommodation for tourists is generally good and ranges from shared dorm rooms to 5-star luxury hotels. Sleeper trains can also be a decent option if you schedule your long-distance travel overnight (see the Get around section of this page for more information).\nIn the past, only a few hotels were allowed to take foreign guests, but as of 2024 any licensed hotel in China outside restricted areas by law must accept foreigners. In practice, many hotels, especially cheaper ones or those in remote areas, never got the memo, don't know how to use the mandatory registration system, or simply don't want to bother. You can try your luck by showing them the official announcement in Chinese, but using an English-language booking service like Trip.com can help avoid this hassle, as hotels that choose to list there are almost always foreigner-friendly.\nAny hotel that does accept you will require a photocopy of your passport, some will check if your visa has expired, and they are supposed to share information with the authorities. On rare occasions, someone from your hotel will escort you to the local police station to satisfy the establishment's reporting requirement.\nFinding a hotel when arriving in a Chinese city is difficult if you don't know where to look and what you're looking for. In general, neither star ratings nor price are an accurate indication of the quality of the hotel, so research before booking. If you're willing to pay \u00a5180 or more for a room, you'll probably have little problem finding one. You could, for example, search Google Maps with the name of a chain hotel listed under \"mid-range\", below, determine what the address would be in Chinese, and then write that down on a note which you give to a taxi driver. There are usually cheap hotels near the train or bus station. If you do plan on just showing up in town and looking for a place to sleep, it's best to arrive before 18:00 or the most popular places will be booked for the night. If you are absolutely at a loss for finding housing, the local police (\u8b66\u5bdf) or Public Security Bureau (\u516c\u5b89\u5c40) can help you find a place to crash - at least for one night.\nPrices are often negotiable, and a sharp reduction from the price listed on the wall can often be had, even in nicer hotels, by simply asking \"what's the lowest price?\" (\u6700\u4f4e\u591a\u5c11 zu\u00ecd\u012b du\u014dsh\u01ceo). When staying for more than a few days it is also usually possible to negotiate a lower daily rate. However, these negotiating tactics won't work during the busy Chinese holiday seasons when prices sky-rocket and rooms are hard to get. Many hotels, both chains and individual establishments, have membership cards offering discounts to frequent guests.\nIn mid-range and above hotels, it was once quite common for guests to receive phone calls offering \"massage\" services (that actually offered additional physical services) but this has become rarer such that male guests might just encounter business cards stuffed under the door.\nBooking a room over the Internet with a credit card can be a convenient and speedy method of making sure you have a room when you arrive at your destination, and there are numerous websites that cater for this. Credit cards are not widely used in China, particularly in smaller and cheaper hotels. Such hotels usually ask to be paid in cash, and many hotels ask for a cash security deposit of a few hundred yuan up front. Some online services allow you to book without a credit card and pay cash at the hotel. During Chinese holidays, when it is difficult to get a room anywhere, this may be an acceptable option, but in the off-season, rooms are plentiful almost everywhere and it may be just as easy to find a room upon arrival as it is to book one over the Internet.\nAcross China, check-out is normally noon, and there is often the possibility of paying half a day's cost to get an 18:00 checkout.\nFor those staying in China on a more permanent basis, rental is possible with the obvious caveat that all contracts are in Chinese. Real estate prices are exorbitant in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, surpassing even those of many major Western cities.\nCamping in China is in a legal grey area, but in general, the authorities will not stop you from camping in the wilderness so long as you stay out of restricted areas, and do not cause damage to the environment. Try to avoid camping too close to a city, as the police tend to be more edgy about that, and you might be forced to unpitch your tent and be escorted to a hotel. Designated campgrounds are still somewhat of a rarity in China, but are growing in number as the popularity of camping grows among younger middle class Chinese. RV camping is also growing in popularity, and it is possible to explore China by RV with some advanced planning.\n\n\nLow-cost housing\nMany ultra-cheap options would not appeal to most travelers from developed countries for security and cleanliness reasons. In the cheapest range of hotels it is important to ask if hot water is available 24 hours-a-day (\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u70ed\u6c34 y\u01d2um\u00e9iy\u01d2u \u00e8rshis\u00ec ge xi\u01ceosh\u00ed de r\u00e8shu\u01d0), and check if the shower, sink and toilet actually work. It is also advisable to avoid checking into a room next to a busy street as traffic may keep you up late and wake you up early.\n\nHostels (\u9752\u5e74\u65c5\u793e) are the most comfortable low-cost options. They typically cater to foreigners, have English-speaking employees, and provide cheap, convenient transport around town. Some of them are even cleaner and better furnished than more expensive places. Hostels also have a cozy, international atmosphere and are a good place to meet other travelers and get some half-decent Western food. In most cities of any size there is at least one hostel available, and in travel hot spots there are plenty of hostels, although they can still fill up quickly because of their popularity with backpackers. Hostels can often be booked on-line in advance although you definitely should bring a print-out of your confirmation as not all hostels are aware that you can book their rooms (and pay a portion of the cost) on-line in advance. In Beijing, many hostels are in hutongs - traditional courtyard homes in the midst of a maze of traditional streets and architecture. While many of Beijing's Hutongs have been demolished, a movement to save those which remain has led to a boom in youth hostels for backpackers and boutique hotels for the mid-range traveler.\nDorm rooms (\u5bbf\u820d) are found on university campuses, near rural tourist attractions and as part of some hotels. Most travelers have spotty luck with dorms. It is common to have rowdy or intoxicated roommates, and shared bathrooms can take some getting used to, especially if you're not used to traditional squat toilets or taking cold showers. However, in some areas, especially on top of some of China's holy mountains, dorm rooms might be the only budget option in a sea of luxury resorts.\n\nZh\u00f9s\u00f9 (\u4f4f\u5bbf), which simply translates as \"accommodation\", can refer to any kind of sleeping accommodation, but those places that have the Chinese characters for zhusu written on the wall outside are the cheapest. A zhusu is not a hotel, but simply rooms for rent in homes, restaurants, and near train and bus stations. Zhusu rooms are universally spartan and bathrooms are almost always shared. The price can be quite low, costing only a few dozen renminbi. Officially a zhusu should not provide a room to a foreigner, but many times the caretaker is eager to get a client and will be willing to rent to anyone. There are never any English signs advertising a zhusu, so if you can't read Chinese you may have to print out the characters for your hunt. Security in zhusu's is sketchy, so this option is not recommended if you have valuables with you.\nSpas: spa costs vary but can be as low as \u00a525. Admission to a spa is typically for 24 hours, but entering a spa late at night (after 01:00) and leaving before noon may get you a 50% discount. Spas provide beds or reclining couches and a small locker for bags and personal possessions (this is ideal if you are traveling light), but there is no privacy because usually everyone sleeps in one room (so there is more security than in a dorm, since there are attendants who watch over the area, and your belongings (even your clothes!) are stored away in a locker). There are also showers, saunas, complimentary food, and paid services such as massages and body scrubbing. Don't be fooled when receptionists try to make up reasons why you have to pay more than the listed rate. They may try to convince you that the listed rates are only for members, locals, women, men, or include only one part of the spa (i.e. shower, but no bed/couch). To verify any claims, strike up a conversation with a local a good distance away from the spa and inquire about the prices. Don't let them know that you are checking the spa's claims. Just act as if you are thinking about going there if the price is good. If they know that the spa is trying to overcharge you, they will typically support the spa's claim.\n\n\nBudget hotels\n\nBudget hotels cater almost exclusively to Chinese clients and usually lack English-speaking staff. Particularly in rural areas, many of them are unaware of how to use the mandatory registration system for foreign guests, and thus reluctant to accept foreigners. However, since 2024, they have been required by law to accept foreigners, so be firm but polite with the front desk staff, and particularly if you can speak some Chinese, you should be able to convince them to accept you. \nThe cheapest range of Chinese budget hotels (one step above the zhusu) are called zh\u0101od\u00e0isu\u01d2 (\u62db\u5f85\u6240). Unlike zhusu these are licensed accommodations but are similarly spartan and utilitarian, often with shared bathrooms. Slightly more luxurious budget hotels and Chinese business hotels may or may not have English signs and usually have the words l\u01dagu\u01cen (\u65c5\u9986, meaning \"travel hotel\"), b\u012bngu\u01cen or ji\u01d4di\u00e0n (\u5bbe\u9986 and \u9152\u5e97, respectively, meaning \"hotel\") in their name. Room options typically include singles and doubles with attached bathrooms, and dorms with shared baths. Some budget hotels include complementary toiletries and Internet. In small towns a night's stay might be as cheap as \u00a525; in bigger cities rooms usually cost \u00a580-120. One problem with such hotels is that they can be quite noisy as patrons and staff may be yelling to each other across the halls into the wee hours of the morning. Another potential inconvenience is taking a room with a shared bath as you may have to wait to use a shower or squat toilet that moreover isn't in any sort of appealing condition. In smaller budget hotels the family running the place may simply lock up late at night when it appears no more customers are coming. If you plan to arrive late, explain this in advance or else you may have to call the front desk, bang on the door, or climb over the gate to get in.\n\n\nMid-range hotels\nThese are usually large, clean and comfortable, with rooms ranging from \u00a5150 to over \u00a5300. Frequently the same hotels will also have more expensive and luxurious rooms. The doubles are usually quite nice and up to Western standards, with a clean private bathroom that has towels and free toiletries. A buffet breakfast may be included, or a breakfast ticket can be purchased for around \u00a510.\nSprouting up around China are a number of Western-quality mid-range hotels that include the following chains, all of which have rooms in the \u00a5150-300 range and on-line advance booking:\n\n 7 Days Inns (7\u5929\u8fde\u9501\u9152\u5e97). \n JinJiang Inns (\u9526\u6c5f\u4e4b\u661f). \n Home Inns (\u5982\u5bb6\u5feb\u6377\u9152\u5e97). \n Green Tree Inns (\u683c\u6797\u8c6a\u6cf0\u9152\u5e97). (English) \n Super 8 Motels by Wyndham. (English) \n\n\nSplurge\nThe high end includes international hotel chains and resorts, such as Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton and Shangri-La and their Chinese competitors. These charge hundreds or thousands of yuan per night for luxurious accommodations with 24-hour room service, satellite TV, spas, and western breakfast buffets. There are suites in Shanghai, for example, for over \u00a510,000 a night. Many of these establishments cater to traveling business-types with expense accounts and charge accordingly for food and amenities (i.e. \u00a520 for a bottle of water which costs \u00a52 at a convenience store). Internet (wired or wireless) which is usually free in mid-range accommodations is often a pay service in high-end hotels.\nSome hotels in the \u00a5400-700 range such as Ramada or Days Inn are willing to lower their prices when business is slow. Chinese three and four-star hotels will often give block pricing or better deals for stays of more than 5 days. If you are coming to China on a tour, the tour company may be able to get you a room in a true luxury hotel for a fraction of the listed price.\n\n\nLearn\nSee also: Studying in China\nTraditional Chinese culture places a strong emphasis on education, so there is no lack of options for those who wish to receive quality education in China.\nChina's universities offer many different types of courses, and some of them are regularly ranked among the top universities in the world. Universities accept students who have achieved the minimum of a high-school education for courses in the Chinese language. These courses usually last 1 or 2 years. Students are given certificates after they complete their course. Students who do not speak Chinese and want to study further in China are usually required to complete a language-training course.\nThere are many opportunities to learn Chinese in China, including university courses and special programs. Scholarships may be available, from your home country or the Chinese government. In any city with a sizeable expat community, you can also find private classes, which you can take on the side while working in China. While not as popular as Mandarin, there are also some opportunities to study the local dialects and ethnic minority languages.\n\n\nWork\nSee also: Working in China\nChina has grown so much that it is on track to become the world's biggest economy. Although the labor market is difficult for foreigners to access, there are, however, significant opportunities for those who wish to experience China. It is illegal to work in China on a tourist or business visa, and while many foreigners used to get away with doing so, the Chinese government is cracking down on the practice; you will need to proactively make sure your employer goes through the appropriate procedures for you.\nEmployment opportunities include English-language teaching, engineering, tech jobs, international trade, scientific research and working for multi-nationals. For most jobs, Chinese immigration law requires foreigners to have at least a bachelor's degree and 2 years of work experience before they can be granted a work visa, and your application will be rejected if you do not have one. See Working in China for details.\n\n\nStay safe\nWhile China is generally safe for visitors, the government has some authoritarian aspects, and the topic of human rights in China is highly contested. Despite what's written in the Chinese constitution, in practice some freedoms are strongly curtailed, such as free speech, privacy, freedom of information and the press, freedom of religion, and the right to a fair trial. As long as you're not deliberately provocative, most of these are unlikely to affect you during your visit \u2014 especially since enforcement is somewhat arbitrary anyway \u2014 but if they do, punishments can be heavy. China is known to use extrajudicial detention, torture, and the death penalty. Often criticized as \"hostage diplomacy\", detentions and enforcement are sometimes stepped up in reaction to geopolitical events, meaning that, for example, Canadian and American businesspeople faced extra scrutiny in 2019. Chinese dual citizens and people of Chinese heritage who are citizens of other countries have been subject to \"exit bans\", kept in China, sometimes for years, to compel them to cooperate with government investigations or pressure their relatives to return to China.\nAs long as you behave and do not get involved in drugs or political activity, you shouldn't have any problems. Even bypassing the Internet firewall or accessing potentially subversive material is usually overlooked for the average visitor. However, it doesn't hurt to have a contingency plan in case you run afoul of the government.\n\n\nPolice\n\nThe main law enforcement agency you will encounter is the public security police, often abbreviated as the public security (\u516c\u5b89, g\u014dng'\u0101n; \u8b66\u5bdf, j\u01d0ngch\u00e1 is also understandable.), or civilian police (\u6c11\u8b66, m\u00ednj\u01d0ng). You can recognise officers by their uniforms, usually comprising of light blue shirts and navy blue peaked caps, though traffic police wear white peaked caps instead. Officers are required to carry their police identification cards when on duty, and must present it to members of the public on request. Unlike in most other countries, civilian police officers in China typically do not carry firearms on standard patrol; incidents requiring firearms are left to specialist firearms units to handle. Most public security police officers are professional and helpful when approached, though the language barrier can be a problem for foreign tourists.\nThe People's Armed Police (PAP) (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u6b66\u88c5\u8b66\u5bdf\u90e8\u961f), often abbreviated as the armed police (\u6b66\u8b66, w\u01d4j\u01d0ng), is a branch of the Chinese military with law enforcement responsibilities. You are most likely to encounter them guarding key installations such as airports, embassies and government buildings, or assisting the civilian police with crowd control. Their soldiers wear military uniforms similar to those of other Chinese soldiers with the characters \u4e2d\u56fd\u6b66\u8b66 at the top of the insignia patch on their left sleeve, and carry military identification cards. Like their civilian counterparts, most PAP soldiers are professional and helpful when approached, but you should not expect much English language ability.\nChengguan (\u57ce\u7ba1, ch\u00e9nggu\u01cen) are security officers employed by the respective municipal governments to assist the police in maintaining public order. Their uniforms are similar to those of public security police officers, but in a slightly darker shade of blue. Unlike public security police officers, they do not have powers of arrest. Chengguan officers have a reputation for being poorly-trained, brutal, and sometimes corrupt.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on corruption, so under no circumstances should you offer a bribe to any type of law enforcement officer, as this could result in legal consequences for you and the person accepting your bribe.\nPrivate security officers in China dress similarly to the police, and also often use lights and sirens on their vehicles, but do not have powers of arrest.\n\n\nCrime\nCrime rates vary across this huge nation, but in general China's crime rate compares favorably with those of most Western countries. It is generally not a problem for women to roam the streets alone at night. Violent crime is very rare, but scams and opportunistic thefts are more common. So long as you take the usual precautions and use your commonsense, you should be fine.\nGenerally speaking, crime rates are higher in the larger cities than in the countryside. Nevertheless, their crime rates usually compare favorably with those of Western cities of similar sizes, so if you avoid seedy areas and use your common sense, you'll be fine. Video surveillance is widely used in both urban and in some rural areas. CCTVs are welcomed by the police, due to the fact that front-line officers are often insufficient to deal with China's huge population.\nPickpocketing is an issue in crowded places, though much less common than it used to be due to the popularity of cashless transactions. Be particularly vigilant when on public transport during peak hours, as it provides the perfect cover for pickpockets to get away after striking.\nBicycle theft can be a problem. In big cities there are stories of locals who have lost three bikes within one month, but in some other places, local people still casually park their bikes. Follow what local people do. Assume your expensive lock won't help at all; professional thieves can break virtually any lock. In China, bike parking is common outside supermarkets or shopping centers, and usually charges \u00a51-2 per day (usually until 20:00-22:00). If you have an electric bicycle or scooter, be extra cautious as the battery packs or charger may be targeted. If possible, find a bike park that is monitored by CCTVs, as that will make it easier for police to track your bike down should it get stolen.\nThe main crimes foreigners get in trouble for are around drug use (including drug use outside China before you arrived \u2014 they sometimes do a hair test for cannabis) or working illegally, with the consequence usually being a short sentence, fine and deportation. If you are accused of a more serious crime, then your first 72 hours of investigation is critical. It is during that time that the police, prosecutors and your lawyers will investigate, negotiate and decide if you are guilty. Police use hard interrogations (or torture) immediately after arrest because eliciting a confession is the quickest way to secure a conviction. Chinese law prohibits your lawyer from being present during your interrogation. If your case goes to trial, then your conviction is merely a formality (99.9% of criminal trials in 2013 ended in a conviction), and the judge's only role is to decide your sentence. Signing any document during your interrogation would be an extremely bad idea, especially if you do not understand what you are signing. You should politely insist that you be allowed access to consular services and a translator.\n\n\nScams\nSee also: Common scams, Pickpockets\nChinese people are in general hospitable to foreigners, and want to leave a good impression on tourists visiting their country. However, as with anywhere else, there are also scam artists who operate at tourist hot spots, so it pays to be prudent and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.\nHigh prices do not necessarily indicate a scam. In a teahouse or bar, \u00a550-200 per cup or pot of tea (including hot water refills) and \u00a515-60 per bottle of beer is not uncommon. Tea samplings may also charge high prices for each sample.\nTouristy parts of Beijing and Shanghai have become notorious for various scams. If you are keen to avoid being scammed, the following are good rules of thumb:\n\nIt is less likely for scammers to operate outside of the usual tourist spots\nIf you are approached in a touristy area by a person who appears too enthusiastic about going to a particular place (teahouse or otherwise), you are likely to pay a premium and maybe get a better time elsewhere\nIf you are uncomfortable, walk away.\nMost ordinary Chinese people are unable to speak English, so be on your guard if someone approaches you spontaneously and starts speaking to you in English.\nThe police are sensitive to foreigners being targeted in this way and giving the country a poor reputation. In China, you have a legal right to ask for a \"fa piao\" (\u53d1\u7968, lit. receipt/invoice) which is an official sales invoice issued by the taxation department. It is against the law for an owner to refuse to give it to you. For scams, they generally will refuse since it is legal evidence of their extortionate price.\nAccident scams occur, too, and even 'good samaritans' who help people genuinely in distress have been sued for compensation by the people they were trying to help. These scams are not tried on foreigners too often, but be careful when using a vehicle and always record your journey with a dashboard or bicycle camera.\nIf you find yourself being or having been scammed then call 110 and report it immediately. Suspicious phone calls can be enquired through 96110. The police may also alert you if you or your family members encounter possible scams through this number with area code prefix (such as 010-96110 if you are in Beijing).\n\n\nTraffic\nSee also: Driving in China\n\nThe mortality rate per person for car accidents in China is lower than that of many Western countries. But, in general, driving in China can range from anywhere from nerve-rattling to outright reckless. Traffic can appear chaotic. Cars are allowed to turn right on a red light and do not stop for pedestrians, regardless of the walk signal. Cars drivers, cyclists and electric scooter drivers will all drive assuming they all have right of way/priority at once. Pedestrian crossings are a guide for the driver where pedestrians are more likely to cross.\nIn cities, however, it is unlikely drivers will be traveling fast enough to cause significant damage. Do as the locals do: cross the road with confidence, be aware of your surroundings, know that cars, bikes and scooters will tend to continue rather than stop.\nDriving a car yourself in China requires a Chinese driving license, and obtaining one is far too complex a process for the average visitor. See Driving in China if you do want to run the bureaucracy gauntlet.\nChina has the highest adoption rate of electric cars in the world, and they tend to be much quieter than the internal combustion engine cars you might be used to back home. Be sure to look carefully before crossing the street, as you might not be able to notice them by sound.\n\n\nTerrorism\nAlthough rare, terrorist attacks in China have occurred, mostly in Xinjiang, where there is a longstanding insurgency by Uyghur Islamist separatists, though there have also been several high-profile attacks outside the province. There is airport-style security at all major train stations, metro stations, and long-distance bus terminals. You will have your bag X-rayed and take water bottles out of your bag to be scanned separately, but there is no need to empty your pockets.\n\n\nBegging\nChinese people traditionally disapprove of begging, so begging is not a major issue in most places. It is, however, never far off the scene and particularly common just outside the main tourist attractions and in major transportation hubs.\nBe aware of child beggars who could be victims of child trafficking. While it is becoming less common, you should avoid giving them any money.\nIn China, local people usually only give money to those who have obviously lost the ability to earn money. Professional beggars have clear deformities, and some syndicates have been known to deliberately maim children as it is seen as more effective in soliciting pity. If you feel like giving them some, bear in mind that the minimum hourly wage ranges from \u00a511 to \u00a524 (2020).\n\n\nFake Buddhist monks\nThe presence of foreign tourists unaware of local Buddhist customs has also given rise to many scams, with many fake monks and temples preying on unsuspecting visitors. Buddhism in China generally follows the Mahayana school, whose monks are required to be vegetarian, and usually grow their own food in the temples, or buy their food using temple donations. As such, they generally do not go on alms round. The main exception is the Dai ethnic minority in Yunnan, who are mostly Theravada Buddhists. While it is customary for Theravada Buddhist monks to go on alms rounds in the morning (since they are not allowed to eat after noon), they are not allowed to accept or even touch money, and alms bowls are solely for the purpose of collecting food. If you see a \"monk\" soliciting monetary donations, he is fake.\nMonks also do not sell religious items (these are sold by laymen), and neither do they offer \"Buddha's blessing\" in exchange for money, or threaten you with misfortune should you not donate. Most temples will have a donation box in the main hall for devotees to make donations should they wish to do so, and monks will never go out in public to ask for donations. According to traditional Buddhist philosophy, it is entirely up to an individual to decide whether and how much he/she wishes to donate, and genuine Buddhist temples will never use high-pressure tactics to solicit donations, or ask for any amount of money in exchange for services.\n\n\nNature\n\nBeing a large country, China is affected by a range of different natural disasters. Pacific typhoons hit the coast in the summer and autumn months, bringing physical destruction and torrential rain. Floods also occur, in particular around the large rivers. Northern parts of the country have winter storms. Much of the country is prone to earthquakes and tornadoes.\nChina has a variety of venomous snakes. Be careful when hiking and seek immediate treatment for any snakebite. The bright green bamboo viper (Trimeresurus stejnegeri) is especially notorious.\n\n\nIllicit drugs\nDrug offences are dealt with harshly in China. Chinese authorities do not distinguish between soft (e.g. marijuana) and hard (e.g. heroin) drugs. It is an offence just to test positive for drugs, even if they were consumed outside the country, and hair tests can come back positive even months after last consumption. Any positive test will likely result in you being detained and deported. While you can get away with possession of small quantities of drugs with a detention (up to 15 days), fine and deportation, drug trafficking is punishable by death. If you have a record of drug use, you may be subject to directed police raids. There are also raids of bars and nightclubs that foreigners frequent.\nChinese people usually associate drugs with national humiliation (due to an unlimited influx of opium after the Opium Wars); publicly doubting the death penalty for drug trafficking or advocating for drug liberalization will likely get you publicly criticized.\n\n\nBanned items\nDue to the fast pace of change in China, you may find some items (especially media) continue to be banned by customs although they are readily available for purchase in the country itself. Searching your belongings for illicit items such as the ones below could potentially happen when entering China through an airport, although in practice it is rare these days.\n\nMaterials considered by the authorities as Anti-Chinese will be confiscated. This has a fairly wide interpretation, but can include the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan lion-mountain flag and literature about the Falun Gong religious group, independence movements in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan or the Tiananmen Square protests. As a rule of thumb, do not bring anything critical of the Communist Party of China; if some literature refers to the government of the PRC as the Communist Party of China (\u4e2d\u5171), then it's either from Taiwan (as the local official term when referring to the Chinese government), and/or its stance is likely to be critical of the party.\nThe Epoch Times (\u5927\u7d00\u5143\u6642\u5831) and Ming Hui Times (\u660e\u6167\u5468\u520a/\u660e\u6167\u5468\u5831) are two examples of Falun Gong literature. The Falun Gong sect is known to print proselytising words on Chinese yuan bills, so consider checking your bills to avoid unnecessary hassle.\nMaps that are contrary to the Chinese territorial claim, such as coloring Taiwan as a sovereign state or distinct from Mainland China, or denoting Arunachal Pradesh (South Tibet) as part of India, are also checked and confiscated at the border.\nA heavy penalty is imposed on all pornography and penalties are counted based on the number of pieces brought into the country.\n\n\nReligion\nModern Chinese society is in general rather secular.\nVisitors to China rarely get into trouble for practicing their religion. As a communist country, China is officially atheist, and religion is banned for people working in government jobs. Although religion was targeted for extermination during the Cultural Revolution, in modern times, visitors and private citizens are generally free to practice a religion if they wish. However, proselytizing is prohibited and taken very seriously by the government, and could potentially lead to arrest and imprisonment, especially if there is any fear that it could undermine the government's authority.\nCatholics in China are split between the state-sanctioned Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5929\u4e3b\u6559\u7231\u56fd\u4f1a Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 Ti\u0101nzh\u01d4ji\u00e0o \u00c0igu\u00f3 Hu\u00ec), which is run separately from the Vatican, and illegal underground churches. The situation is similar for Protestant churches. Falun Gong is illegal and heavily censored in China. Visibly supporting it will make you subject to arrest.\n\n\nRacism\nAlthough unprovoked violent racist attacks are virtually unheard of, foreigners, particularly darker-skin ones, often suffer discrimination in employment and are the subject of stereotyping from Chinese people. Even white foreigners, who allegedly enjoy significantly better treatment than locals, have been occasionally confronted by Chinese people during politically sensitive periods. Racism tends to be more common among the older and less educated demographics, and less common among younger university-educated people.\nDue to geopolitical tensions with the United States, many Chinese have developed a negative view of the U.S. government. Nevertheless, most Chinese are still polite and welcoming towards American tourists, and even hardliners usually make a distinction between the foreign governments they distrust and individual tourists from those countries.\nDue to historical conflicts and current geopolitical tensions, many Chinese hold a hostile view of Japan. Hate speech against Japanese is common, and hate crimes against Japanese people have been known to occur. Japanese people should be careful and keep a low profile when visiting sensitive sites connected to the Sino-Japanese War such as the Nanjing Massacre Memorial. On sensitive dates like September 18 (the date when the Mukden incident occurred), it is best to take extra precautions and avoid crowds. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan has issued an series of manuals to instruct how to stay safe during a visit.\nIf your skin tone doesn't match people's assumptions for someone from your country, and especially if you're ethnically Chinese, you may be treated like the country on your passport isn't where you're really from. Visas on arrival are sometimes denied on this basis.\nChinese people have traditionally held Jews in high regard, but anti-Jewish sentiment has risen as a result of the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war due to China's longstanding support of Palestine. Publicly supporting Israel will likely get you harshly criticized. However, unprovoked harassment or violence against Jews in the street remains exceedingly rare.\n\n\nLGBT travelers\nChina is generally a safe destination for gay and lesbian travelers. There are no laws against homosexuality in China, though there is censorship of homosexual-themed content in the media, and public advocacy of LGBT rights could raise hostility from the conservatives. Gay scenes and communities are found in major cities, but are generally non-existent everywhere else. Most Chinese are reluctant to discuss their sexuality in public, as it is generally considered to be a personal matter, and acceptance of homosexuality by Chinese people tends to be mixed. Same-sex marriages and unions are not recognised anywhere in the country.\nWhile openly displaying your sexual orientation in public is still likely to draw stares and whispers, gay and lesbian visitors should generally not run into any major problems, and unprovoked violence against homosexual couples is almost unheard of. In general, the younger generation in the major cities tend to be most accepting of homosexuality, with Chengdu in particular being popularly regarded as the gay capital of China.\nStaff in hotels and guesthouses may assume that a mistake has been made if a same-sex couple has reserved a room with one large bed and try to move you to another room. However, they will generally back down if you insist that it is not a problem.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\n\nPersonal hygiene\nOutside major cities, public washrooms range from mildly unpleasant to utterly repulsive. In cities, it varies from place to place. High-quality bathrooms can be found inside major tourist attractions, at international hotels, office buildings, and upper-class department stores. Washrooms in foreign restaurant chains, or any of the coffee chains listed in the drink section are usually more or less clean. While those in common restaurants and hotels are barely acceptable, those in hotel rooms are generally clean. Some public facilities are free, others cost from a few mao up to \u00a52. Separate facilities are always provided for men (\u7537 n\u00e1n) and women (\u5973 n\u01da), but sometimes there are no doors on the front of the stalls.\nThe sit-down toilet familiar to Westerners is rare in China in public areas. Hotels will generally have them in rooms, but in places where Westerners are scarce, expect to find squat toilets more often than not. Many private homes in urban areas now have sit-down toilets, and one major benefit from having a local host is that they have clean bathrooms. As a rule of thumb, a western establishment such as McDonald's or Starbucks will have a western toilet, but may not have toilet paper.\nCarry your own tissue paper (\u536b\u751f\u7eb8 w\u00e8ish\u0113ngzh\u01d0, or \u9762\u7eb8 mi\u00e0nzh\u01d0) as it is rarely provided. You can sometimes buy it from the money-taker at a public toilet; you can also buy it in bars, restaurants and Internet caf\u00e9s for \u00a52. Put used paper in the bucket next to the toilet; do not flush it away as it may block the often poor plumbing systems. There may not be soap in the public washrooms either.\nThe Chinese tend to distrust the cleanliness of bathtubs, and while in China, you should too. In hotels with fixed bathtubs, disposable plastic bathtub liners may be provided. If you feel like having a bath, use them.\nWash your hands often with soap if you can find any, carry some disposable disinfectant tissues (found in almost any department or cosmetics store), or use alcohol gel.\n\n\nFood and drink\n\n\nFood\nAlthough there are few nationally-enforced health regulations in restaurants, each major city does have an inspection regime that requires each establishment to prominently display the result (good, average or poor). It is hard to say how effective this is, but it is a start. Restaurants generally prepare hot food when you order. Even in the smallest of restaurants, hot dishes are usually freshly prepared, instead of reheated, and rarely cause health problems.\nA rule of thumb regarding street food is to make certain it is cooked thoroughly while you are watching; also, visit stalls frequented by locals, and look for plastic-wrapped disposable chopsticks.\nMinor stomach discomfort may still be experienced from street food and restaurant food alike, but is said to pass as one becomes accustomed to the local food. Ginger can be effective against nausea.\n\n\nDrink\nChinese people do not drink water straight from the tap, even in the cities. All hotels provide a thermos flask of boiled water in your room (refillable by your floor attendant), a kettle you can use to do it yourself or a sealed plastic bottle of commercial mineral water. Tap water is safe to drink after boiling.\nSome apartments and businesses have rather large water filters installed (which require changing twice a year) to improve the quality of water for cooking and washing. It still doesn't make the water drinkable from the tap, however it does improve the water quality a great deal.\nPurified drinking water in bottles is available everywhere, and is generally quite cheap. \u00a52 is normal for a small bottle. Check that the seal on the cap is not broken. Beer, wine and soft drinks are also cheap and safe.\nAlso note that much river water in China has been contaminated by chemicals that filters can not help much with, although this should only be dangerous if consumed over an extended period of time.\n\n\nPollution\n\nDue to a rapid rate of industrialization in China, pollution and heavy smog is unfortunately part of the way of life in most major towns and cities. That said, stricter environmental protection laws are slowly beginning to bear fruit, with the result that Beijing is no longer the most polluted city in the world, but there is still a long way to go. Even the countryside, depending on the province in question, is not immune.\nLong-term effects of smog particulate are unlikely to have a significant effect on your health if you are in China for a short stay (e.g. a number of weeks) and have no significant respiratory problems. If you are concerned, discuss this with a medical professional before your trip.\nPlaces at higher altitudes or plains like parts of Yunnan and Sichuan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet and outlying islands such as Hainan usually have good air quality. Visitors should be prepared to see smog, which can be quite heavy, in nearly all large cities, including those on the coast.\nThis website can provide detailed hourly pollution readings for most large cities.\nYou will also hear a lot of noise. Construction and renovation are full-time activities. Chinese and long-time residents' ears are adapted to filter and tolerate it.\n\n\nHealth care\n\nThe quality of Chinese hospitals for the Chinese people is generally not up to the standards of the West. Local doctors have been known to prescribe more expensive treatments than necessary; IV drips are routine prescriptions in China, even for minor ailments like the common cold, and doctors have a tendency to liberally prescribe antibiotics. Most locals go to the hospital even for the most minor ailments, and the concept of a private clinic effectively does not exist. You should consider keeping a significant amount of cash readily available for emergencies, since not being able to pay upfront may delay treatment.\nAmbulance services are expensive, require upfront payment, are not accorded much priority on the roads and are therefore not particularly fast. Quality of ambulance service also varies with regions, and paramedics in poorer regions are often poorly equipped and trained. Taking a taxi to the hospital in an emergency will often be much quicker.\nCommon therapeutic drugs \u2014 things like penicillin or insulin \u2014 are generally available from a pharmacist with a prescription and considerably cheaper than in western countries. You can usually ask to see the instructions that came with the box. Western medicine is called x\u012by\u00e0o (\u897f\u836f). Less common drugs are often imported, hence expensive.\nIn larger cities there are strong controls over medicine, and even 'standard' cold medicine such as acetaminophen/paracetamol or dextromethorphan may require a prescription or a foreign passport. Opiates always require a prescription, although Viagra never does.\nIn smaller cities and rural areas many medicines, including most antibiotics, are often available without a prescription.\n\nMost Chinese doctors and nurses, even in larger cities, will speak little or no English. However, medical staff are in plentiful supply and hospital wait times are generally short - usually less than 10 minutes at general clinics (\u95e8\u8bca\u5ba4 m\u00e9nzh\u011bnsh\u00ec), and virtually no wait time at emergency rooms (\u6025\u8bca\u5ba4 j\u00edzh\u011bnsh\u00ec).\nThere are private Western-style clinics and hospitals in most major Chinese cities which provide a higher standard of care at a much higher price. The doctors and nurses will speak English (with interpretation services often available for other foreign languages), and are often hired from, or have obtained their medical qualifications in Western countries. These provide an easy and comfortable way to obtain familiar Western treatment from doctors qualified in the West, although you will be paying a steep premium for these services starting at \u00a51,000 just for the consultation. Check beforehand to see whether your insurance will cover all or part of this.\nFor any significant surgery, it is worth considering traveling to Hong Kong, Taiwan or South Korea as the standard of treatment and care is more aligned to Western standards.\nEnsure that needles used for injections or any other procedure that requires breaking the skin are new and unused - insist on seeing the packet being broken open. In some parts of China it is acceptable to re-use needles, albeit after sterilization.\nFor acupuncture, although disposable needles are quite common in mainland China, you can provide your own needles if you prefer. The disposable type, called sterilized acupuncture needles (\u65e0\u83cc\u91dd\u7078\u91dd) usually cost \u00a510-20 per 100 needles and are available in many pharmacies. There should be minimal to no bleeding when the needle is inserted and removed if the acupuncturist is sufficiently skilled.\nWhile Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is ubiquitous in China, regulation tends to be lax and it is not unheard of for Chinese TCM practitioners to prescribe dangerous herbs. Do some research and ensure you have some trusted local friends to help you out if you wish to see a TCM practitioners. You can head to Hong Kong or Taiwan instead, as the practice is better regulated there.\n\n\nInfectious diseases\nAs of Oct 2023, COVID-19 restrictions have been largely eliminated, but may vary widely depending on local regulations. Health declaration forms (also known as \"black code\") are no longer needed for immigration unless one has COVID-19 symptoms. Face masks may still be required in some areas.\nIf making more than a short trip to China, it may be a good idea to get vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Typhoid as they can be spread via contaminated food, and Japanese encephalitis which is transmitted in rural areas.\nParts of southern China have mosquitoes which transmit dengue fever.\nAs of 2019 the official estimate is that nearly 1 million people in China are living with HIV/AIDS. One in four infected individuals do not know their status. Sex workers, clients of sex workers and injecting drug users are the most infected groups.\nNew diseases are sometimes a threat in China, particularly in its more densely populated parts. There have been cases of bird flu: avoid undercooked poultry or eggs.\n\n\nRespect\n\nForeigners are still a rare breed in most parts of China, which means that how you interact with people there may well shape their impression of your country or even of foreigners in general. Follow the law, be polite, and try to leave a good impression as it affects the general reputation of foreigners in China.\n\nUnlike Japan and South Korea where bowing is extremely common, in China the practice did not survive into the modern era, and is now only used in certain formal occasions such as marriage ceremonies, funerals, religious rituals, and by students greeting teachers in school. Give a soft handshake when greeting someone, which can be accompanied by a slight bow.\nBuddhist monks and nuns should be greeted by placing your palms together at chest level with your thumb and fingers pointing upwards (similar to the Thai wai), and bowing your head slightly while saying \u0112m\u00ectu\u00f3f\u00f3 (\u963f\u5f25\u9640\u4f5b).\nPersonal space more or less does not exist in China. Elevators and buses can get very crowded. It's common and acceptable for someone to come in close contact with you or to bump into you and say nothing. Don't get mad, as they'll be surprised and most likely won't even understand why you're offended.\nImportant items such as business cards or important papers are given and received with both hands.\nBusiness cards in particular are treated very respectfully and formally. How you treat someone's business card is seen as representing how you will treat the person. When accepting a business card, use both hands to pick it up by the corners, give a slight bow of your head, and take the time to read the card and confirm how to pronounce the person's name. It's disrespectful to write on a card, fold it, or place it in your back pocket (where you'll sit on it!); a nice case to keep cards pristine is preferable to a pocket.\nSmoking is increasingly less common amongst younger Chinese, but is still highly prevalent, especially among men. \"No smoking\" signs are routinely ignored in some places, and it's not unusual for someone to smoke in an elevator or even in the hospital. Some cities now forbid smoking in most restaurants, but enforcement varies. Beijing has one of the nation's strictest smoking laws: you are not allowed to smoke anywhere with a roof; again, enforcement is patchy. Western restaurants seem to be the only ones who consistently enforce the ban. Masks would be a good idea for long distance bus trips.\nIf you smoke, it's always considered polite to offer a cigarette to those you meet. This rule applies almost exclusively to men, but under certain circumstances, such as a club, it's okay to offer cigarettes to women.\nIn homes and some other buildings, slippers or sandals are worn indoors. If your hosts are wearing slippers at home, and especially if there is carpet on the floor, remove your shoes and ask for a pair of slippers before you enter, even if your host says you don't have to.\nSaving face is an important concept in Chinese culture, and this concept extends beyond the individual to one's family (including extended family), and even the country. Pointing out mistakes directly may cause embarrassment. If you have to, call the person to one side and tell them in private.\nHumility is highly valued in traditional Chinese culture, and bragging about your achievements is in general not well received. It is also customary to politely turn down any compliments you receive from others; accepting compliments with a simple \"Thank you\", as is typical in the Anglosphere, will come across as arrogant in China.\nChinese people sometimes criticize their own country, but you are highly advised not to do it yourself, as the same things being said by a foreigner tend not to be received so well.\nThe elderly are traditionally treated with special respect in Chinese society. When riding in public transport, you are expected to give up your seat for elderly passengers; failure to do so would invite scorn from your fellow passengers, and could result in you being publicly shamed on social media.\nSwastikas have been used in Buddhist temples since the 5th century to represent Dharma, universal harmony, and the balance of opposites. Like the case for other Asian countries, it does not represent Nazism.\nOutside of a business context, casual clothes are acceptable at most places, including temples and expensive restaurants. Sleeveless or low-cut tops are uncommon and may stand out. At the beach or the pool, conservative swimsuits are much more common than bikinis. However, women can generally dress more freely in China than in Japan or South Korea.\nIn rural areas, it is normal for shrines and tombstones erected for the deceased to be near the roadside. Do not take pictures of graveyards or tombstones. Doing so will provoke significant hostility if you are caught as it is believed to bring misfortune to a community, and can result in your immediate expulsion from the area.\n\n\nGifts\nWhen visiting someone's home, a small gift is always welcome. Wine, fruit, or some trinket from your native country are common. When receiving a gift, it is generally rude to open it in front of the person who gave it to you unless (s)he specifically tells you to do so. Wait until the person has left and open it in private.\nSome items are not given as gifts because of cultural associations. Some things to watch out for: black and white are important colors in funerals, scissors or knives may insinuate you want to cut off your relationship with someone, and many people see mirrors as bad luck. Other taboos are based on homophones: the word \"four\" (\u56db s\u00ec) sounds like \"death\" (\u6b7b s\u01d0), \"pear\" (\u68a8 l\u00ed) and \"umbrella\" (\u4f1e s\u01cen) sound like \"separation\" (\u79bb l\u00ed, \u6563s\u00e0n), and \"giving a clock\" (\u9001\u949f s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng) is a homophone for \"attending a funeral\" (\u9001\u7ec8 s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng). These gift taboos and others vary by region and generation, so it's a good idea to consult a local for advice, or at least search the Internet for lists of taboo gifts before you purchase one.\n\n\nEating and drinking\nEating is very important in Chinese culture, and dining out is a widespread way to honor guests and deepen relationships. Seating at a formal dinner follows a specific order, with the host or most senior person at the center. Don't pick up your chopsticks until the most senior person at the table has done so. Table manner varies from different places among different people in different scenarios. Sometimes you can see Chinese spit on a restaurant floor, pick their tooth in front of you, and yell whilst dining, but it's not always welcome. Follow what other people do.\nHosts tend to order more food than you can eat because it's considered shameful if they can't stuff their guests. Although it varies regionally, finishing your plate generally means you're still hungry and may prompt your hosts to order more food, but leaving too much can imply you didn't like a dish; leaving an appropriate amount of food on your plate is a bit of a balancing act.\nWhen offered a drink, you're expected to take it or your friends will keep pushing you. Excuses such as \"I'm on medication\" are better than \"I don't feel like drinking\". Toasts are common, and it's generally considered rude to turn down a toast (although you can take small sips with each toast).\nChina has a strong drinking culture, especially in business, and turning down alcohol can sometimes cause offense. However, foreigners may be given some slack on this. If the hard baijiu is too much for you, consider opting for a beer instead.\n\n\nPaying\nWhile splitting the bill is beginning to be accepted by young people, treating is still the norm, especially when the parties are in obviously different social classes. Men are expected to treat women, elders to juniors, rich to poor, hosts to guests, working class to non-income class (students). Friends of the same class will usually prefer to take turns treating rather than split the bill.\nIt is common to see Chinese competing intensely to pay the bill. You are expected to fight back and say \"It's my turn, you treat me next time.\" That being said, Chinese tend to be very tolerant towards foreigners. If you feel like going Dutch, try it. They tend to believe that \"all foreigners prefer to go Dutch\".\n\n\nPolitics\nFor your safety, it's best if you avoid getting involved in any political activity, and avoid discussing politics with Chinese people. Most Chinese are passive about their country's politics and are generally reluctant to talk about it, and in most cases, will change the topic of discussion.\n\nMost Chinese are ashamed that their country was forced into unequal treaties with Japan and the Western powers over the past two centuries, and are proud of the progress made by their government in the 21st century in restoring China's status as a great power. Many Chinese are also aware of alternative Western views, but you should tread lightly if you choose to discuss these.\nSupporting the independence movements of Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan or Hong Kong is illegal, so you should avoid discussing them. Most Chinese people support their government's position on these issues, and trying to advocate for these movements is going to do nothing more than getting you into the bad books of your hosts.\nDo not suggest that Hong Kong and Taiwan are not part of China. Be sure to use the term \"mainland\" (\u5927\u9646 d\u00e0l\u00f9) or \"mainland China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5927\u9646 zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 d\u00e0l\u00f9) instead of just \"China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd zh\u014dnggu\u00f3) if you are looking to exclude Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. It is also a common practice in China to refer to Taiwan as \"Taiwan Province\" (\u53f0\u6e7e\u7701), and Hong Kong and Macau as \"Hong Kong, China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd\u9999\u6e2f) and \"Macau, China\" (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6fb3\u95e8).\nAllegations of Uyghur genocide and slavery are sensitive issues that are best not discussed with locals. These are regarded by most Chinese as false allegations that were made up by Western governments for geopolitical reasons.\nAvoid discussing any of the territorial disputes China is involved in, as many Chinese have strong feelings about these issues. If you are drawn into any such discussions, it is best to stay neutral.\nJapan and its role in World War II and other wars with China is a sensitive and emotive issue that is best avoided. To a lesser extent, historical and cultural disputes with both Koreas are also sensitive.\nAvoid displaying Japanese cultural symbols like clothing in places where the Japanese military committed war crimes, particularly Nanjing, and in times of strained Sino-Japanese relations. In particular, do not display the Rising Sun Flag as that is strongly associated with Japanese imperialism, and is the equivalent of what the Nazi flag symbolises in the West.\nThanks to China's recent development, the Chinese government enjoys strong support among its people despite its authoritarian nature. Common Western views that \"they have all been brainwashed\" or \"they are just too afraid to speak up\" oversimplify things.\nOn the other hand, there are always dissidents ranging from anti-revisionist communists (who see reform and opening up policies as capitalist backsliding) to pro-democracy activists who oppose the Communist Party, but they generally remain low-profile unless there is a major incident that puts them in the spotlight.\nMany Chinese have a strong sense of ethnic nationalism. Tread particularly carefully if you are of Chinese ethnicity, even if you were born and raised overseas, as you may still be expected to align your political views with that of the Chinese government, and doing otherwise could result in you being labelled a \"race traitor\".\nThe relationships among China's ethnic minorities, and between minorities and the central government, vary widely between different minority groups, and often within those specific minorities. As a tourist, you are generally advised not to discuss these with the locals. Keep in mind that being proud of their minority language and culture does not in and of itself imply wanting independence from China. To a similar extent, this is also true for the Cantonese language and culture in Guangdong.\n\n\nDiffering cultural norms\nChinese people are sometimes puzzled when foreign visitors complain that Chinese people are rude. Many of them feel that really it's foreigners who tend to be rude. What's actually going on is that China has a different set of customs and values from common Western cultures \u2014 some Chinese behavior can be jarring to foreigners, and vice versa. People in China are friendly without being polite (unlike countries like the UK, where people can be polite without being friendly). Generally speaking, younger well-educated Chinese, particularly those from the major cities, are more likely to behave in a way that conforms more closely to Western cultural norms.\n\nChinese often ignore rules they don't feel like following, including laws. Among many other things, this includes dangerous and negligent driving (see Driving in China) such as driving on the wrong side of the street, excessive speeding, not using headlights at night, not using turn signals, and jaywalking.\nSpitting is common everywhere, including in shops, supermarkets, restaurants, on buses and even in hospitals. Traditional Chinese medicine believes it is unhealthy to swallow phlegm. Although the government has made great efforts to reduce this habit in light of the SARS epidemic as well as the Olympics, it still persists to varying degrees.\nMany Chinese do not cover their mouths when they sneeze. Picking one's nose in public is common and socially acceptable.\nAs many parts of China are ethnically rather homogeneous, people who are visibly foreign will often elicit calls of \"hello\" or \"w\u00e0igu\u00f3r\u00e9n\" (\u5916\u56fd\u4eba \"foreigner\"); you may also hear l\u01ceow\u00e0i (\u8001\u5916), a colloquial equivalent. These calls are ubiquitous outside of the big cities (and are not uncommon even there); these calls will come from just about anyone, of any age, and are even more likely from children and can occur many times in any given day.\nSimilarly, it's rather common that someone may come up and stare at you as if they're watching the TV. The staring usually originates out of sheer curiosity, almost never out of hostility.\nMany Chinese have loud conversations in public, and it may be one of the first things you notice upon arrival. China is rooted in a community-based culture, and noise means life; loud speech usually doesn't mean the speaker is angry or engaged in an argument (although obviously it can). You may want to bring earplugs for long bus or train rides.\nA fairly recent phenomenon particular to China is air rage: groups of passengers being verbally and physically aggressive towards airline staff whenever there is a delay (which is often). This is generally done in order to leverage better compensation from the airline.\nThe concept of waiting in line has not fully been adopted in China. You'll have to learn to be more assertive to get what you want, and even push and shove as others do. If you're trying to catch a taxi, expect other people to move further down the road to catch one before you.\nBe careful when standing behind people on an escalator, since many people have a look-see as soon as they get off \u2014 even when the escalator behind them is fully packed. Department stores have staff to try to prevent this behavior.\nPeople love to use elevators whenever possible, especially in large family groups. Be extra patient if you want to go around a shopping mall with a baby buggy or luggage.\n\n\nCope\n\nElectricity is 220 volts/50 Hz. Two-pin European and North American, as well as three-pin Australian style plugs are generally supported. However, be careful to read the voltage information on your devices to ensure they accept 220 V (twice the 110 V used in many countries) before plugging them in \u2014 you may cause burnout and permanent damage to some devices such as hairdryers and razors. Universal extension cords that can handle a variety of plug shapes (including British) are often used.\nLaundry services may be expensive or hard to find. In upper-end hotels, it will cost \u00a510-30 to wash each article of clothing. Cheap hotels in some areas do not have laundry services, though in other areas such as along the Yunnan tourist trail the service is common and often free. In most areas, with the exception of the downtown areas in big cities, you can find small shops that do laundry. The sign to look for on the front door is \u6d17\u8863 (x\u01d0y\u012b), or spot the clothes hanging from the ceiling. The cost is roughly \u00a52-5/item. In even the smallest of cities dry cleaning (\u5e72\u6d17 g\u0101nx\u01d0\uff09outlets are common and may be able to wash clothes. But in some areas you're going to be stuck washing clothes by hand, which is time-consuming and tiresome, so perhaps opt for fast-drying fabrics such as polyester or silk. If you do find a hotel that does laundry, usually they will put all your clothes into the wash together or even with other items from the hotel, so lighter colours are best washed by hand.\n\nSmoking is banned in public buildings and public transport except for restaurants and bars (including KTVs) - many of which are outright smoke dens, although many multinational restaurant chains do ban smoking. These bans are enforced across the country. Generally, smoking laws are most strict in Shanghai and Beijing, whilst they are more lightly enforced elsewhere. Many places (particularly train stations, hospitals, office buildings and airports) will have smoking rooms, and some long-distance trains may have smoking areas at the end of each car. Facilities for non-smokers are often poor; most restaurants, bars and hotels will not have non-smoking areas apart from top-end establishments although many modern buildings have a smoke extraction systems which suck cigarette smoke out of the room through a ceiling vent - meaning that the smoke doesn't hang in the air. The Chinese phrase for 'May I smoke?' is 'k\u011by\u01d0 ch\u014duy\u0101n ma?' and 'No Smoking!' is 'b\u00f9 k\u011by\u01d0 ch\u014duy\u0101n!'.\nPublic holidays in China are worth being aware of. Although you will never be truly alone in the most popular tourist sites, which includes the popular hikes in particular mountains, on weekends and public holidays these areas can be nearly impassible due to local tourism. What you may have planned as a quiet contemplative hike may turn into a many-hour queue! Know the national holiday dates and plan accordingly.\n\n\nMedia\n\nMedia in China diversified substantially after Mao, with independent outlets offering increasing competition to the state-run agencies of Xinhua (press agency publishing in many formats), CCTV (more than 40 TV channels), and the People's Daily newspaper. These state-owned media tend to be accurate in terms of general news, but always stick to the government's policies and ideology in terms of politics.\nEach province and city in China is also home to its own local channels, often being subordinated or having close ties to the local government, with a stronger focus on local events. Some of these channels also broadcast in the local dialect or ethnic minority language.\nStill, the press remains tightly controlled, with restrictions on what news is reported and what opinions may be aired. Certain topics are strictly off limits (such as criticizing China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan), and the vagueness of boundaries for acceptable topics leads to further self-censorship. The biggest threat to state-controlled media has been the rise of text messaging and Internet news, although these are restricted by the government's firewall and internal censorship.\nChina has some local English-language news media. CCTV News channel is a global English channel available 24/7 in most cities, with French and Spanish variants as well. CCTV 4 has a short newscast in English every day.\nChina Daily (generally subdued, if a bit dry) and the Global Times (a notoriously nationalistic tabloid) are two state-run English-language newspapers available in hotels, supermarkets and newsstands. There are also a few English magazines such as China Today and 21st Century.\nForeign magazines and newspapers are not generally available in bookstores or newsstands except at top hotels.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s and business services\n\nChina has more Internet users than any other country in the world and Internet caf\u00e9s (\u7f51\u5427 w\u01cengb\u0101) are abundant. Most are designed for online gaming and are not comfortable places to do office-style work. It is cheap (\u00a51-6 per hour) to use a computer, albeit one with Chinese software. Internet caf\u00e9s are supposed to require users to show official identification although enforcement varies by region. Browsing of Internet pages may well be monitored by the Public Security Bureau (the police).\nFor printing, scanning, photocopying, and other business services, go to one of any number of small shops in most towns or print shops near university areas. Look for the characters \u590d\u5370 (f\u00f9y\u00ecn) meaning \"photocopy\". Printing costs about \u00a52 per page and photocopies are \u00a50.5 per page. These shops may or may not have Internet access so bring your materials on a flash drive.\n\n\nWi-Fi access\nFree Wi-Fi, which may require registration either with a Chinese mobile number, or your WeChat login, is abundant. The quality and speed of the Wi-Fi is not proportionate to the provider; i.e. your expensive hotel's free Wi-Fi may be nowhere near as fast nor more reliable than the Wi-Fi found on the bus you paid \u00a52 to get on.\nMany hotels and some caf\u00e9s and restaurants provide Wi-Fi, typically free, of varying speeds and quality. Some caf\u00e9s, especially in tourist areas such as Yangshuo, even provide a machine for customer use.\nBusiness hotels typically have wired Internet service for your laptop in each room: 7 Days Inn and Home Inn are two nationwide chains meeting Western standards for mid-range comfort and cleanliness that consistently offer Internet and cost \u00a5150\u2013200 per night. Wi-Fi may also be provided in one's room, perhaps for an extra charge. On occasion, for a bit more, hotels will have rooms with older computers in them as well. The better hotels often have satellite TV in the rooms.\n\n\nInternet security\nSince public computers and the Internet are not secure, assume that anything you type is not private. Do not send sensitive data such as banking passwords from an Internet caf\u00e9. It may be better to purchase a mobile data card for use with your own computer instead (these generally cost \u00a5400 and data plans run \u00a510-\u00a5200 per month depending on your usage).\nIf you are connecting to the Internet with your own computer, some websites in China (especially college campuses) require you to use Microsoft Internet Explorer and to install dedicated software on your system and/or accept certificates to access their websites.\nThere are increasing cases of misuse of photocopy, in which your submitted photocopies are illegally disclosed to spammers and fraudsters by the receiver of your photocopies. Always state the purpose of your photocopies on the photocopies clearly, as this leaves evidence in favour of you should any legal matters arise.\n\n\nInternet censorship\n\nInternet censorship is extensive in mainland China. Pornographic and political sites are routinely blocked, as are many other sites with a broad range of content, including sites that are popular internationally. The government call their censorship system \"Golden Shield\" (\u91d1\u76fe); others call it the Great Firewall of China, GFW, or simply the wall, while circumventing Internet censorship is often referred to as \"scaling the wall\" (\u7ffb\u5899).\n\nCensorship is often tightened during sensitive periods, such as the annual meeting of China's legislature in March, the CCP congress every fourth October, and anniversaries such as the National Day in October and the Tiananmen massacre in June.\nFew hotels offer uncensored Internet access. These hotels generally cater to foreigners, but obviously do not advertise this facility. Try browsing to known restricted sites to see if your hotel supports this.\nFor tourists and short-term visitors, the most effective circumvention is to simply roam on a non-Mainland Chinese SIM as mobile data is typically routed through foreign gateways. There is a thriving marketplace of eSIM providers that resell roaming access on various foreign networks, and mobile providers in Taiwan and Hong Kong market \"Greater Bay\" and Mainland roaming SIMs to travelers proceeding onwards to Mainland China. 3HK is a popular low-cost Hong Kong roaming SIM provider that is friendly to foreign customers.\nFor expats, the most popular way to access blocked websites is to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or V2ray proxy which provides users with relatively stable and reliable access to the Internet through a computer in another country. The best ones have a monthly fee on the order of US$10\u201330; free, ad-supported VPNs are also available. Other ways to bypass censorship include software such as Freegate, Tor (with an obfs4 bridge), and Psiphon. Any of these should be downloaded before entering China as access to their official websites is generally blocked. Be warned that VPNs in China are not as reliable as they used to be\u2014you may want to download more than one so that you have a backup, and be prepared for a lot of frustration and waiting for things to load. Students of foreign educational institutions can try using their institutional VPN. Travelers with the technical know-how are well-served to setup their own private V2ray relays to minimize the risk of detection.\nChinese law enforcement is sometimes able to pinpoint (and arrest, if needed) users who access restricted sites using VPNs, especially if they access them frequently. On at least one occasion, the police pinpointed and fined a netizen who accessed Wikipedia through a VPN. Moreover, it's a criminal offence to upload and submit any materials seen as subversive. However, enforcement is sporadic and mostly targets journalists and high-profile public figures.\n\n\nTelephone\n\n\nArea codes\nThe country dialing code for mainland China is 86. The dialing code is 852 for Hong Kong, 853 for Macau, and 886 for Taiwan.\n\nMajor cities with eight-digit numbers have a two-digit area code. For example, Beijing is (0)10 plus an eight-digit number. Other places use seven- or eight-digit local numbers and a three-digit area code that does not start with 0, 1 or 2. So for example: (0)756 plus 7 digits for Zhuhai. The north uses small numbers, the south has larger numbers.\nNormal cell phones do not need an area code. The numbers are composed of 130 to 132 (or 156/186) plus 8 digits (China Unicom, GSM/UMTS), 133/153/189 plus 8 digits (China Telecom, CDMA) or 134 to 139 (or 150/152/158/159/188) plus 8 digits (China Mobile, GSM/TD-SCDMA). Additional prefixes have been introduced; a good rule of thumb is that an 11-digit domestic phone number that starts with 1 is a mobile number. Mobile phone numbers are geographic; if you attempt to dial a mobile number issued outside of the province you are in from a landline, you will be prompted to redial the number with a zero in front for long-distance.\nThere are two additional non-geographic prefixes. A number starting with 400 can be dialed from any phone and is treated as a local call with associated airtime charges, while a number starting with 800 is totally free but can not be dialed from mobile phones.\nTelephone service is more of a mixed bag. Calling outside China is often difficult and usually impossible without a calling card, which can often only be bought locally. The good news is that these cards are fairly cheap and the connection is surprisingly clear, uninterrupted and delay-free. Look for IP Telephone Cards, which typically have a value of \u00a5100 but sometimes can be had for as little as \u00a525. The cards have printed Chinese instructions, but after dialling the number listed on the card English-spoken instructions are available. As a general indication of price, a call from China to Europe lasts around 22 minutes with a \u00a5100 card. Calls to the US and Canada are advertised to be another 20% cheaper.\nIf you end up with an IC Telephone Card instead, those are only intended to be used in payphones. They may be sold at a slight discount off of face value, but rarely below 20% off when purchased off the street. At a China Telecom payphone, domestic calls will cost \u00a50.1/minute, calls to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, the US, and Canada will cost \u00a51/minute, and calls to all other countries will cost an uneconomical \u00a58/minute.\nIf your line allows for international direct dialling (IDD), the prefix for international calls in China is 00. To make an overseas call, dial 00-(country code)-(number). Calls from the mainland to Hong Kong and Macau require international dialling. IDDs can be expensive. Ask the rate before calling.\n\n\nMobile phones\n\nMobile phones are widespread and offer good service in China. They play an essential role in daily life for most Chinese and for nearly all expatriates in China. As of 2022, China is one of the world leaders in 5G mobile phone technology.\nChina mainly used the TD-LTE 4G standard, which is incompatible with the FD-LTE standard used elsewhere. Some Chinese providers have FD-LTE networks provided as a courtesy to foreign tourists for roaming purposes, though its coverage is not as good as TD-LTE. Having a FD-LTE/TD-LTE dual-mode phone will get you better coverage while roaming in China, but such phones tend to be expensive.\n2G and 3G are gradually being phased out in China. China Unicom began shutting down its 2G network in 2020 and China Telecom is preparing to shut down both its 2G and 3G networks by 2024. China Mobile, on the other hand, has not yet announced a date for shutting down their 2G network, although they have already finished shutting down their 3G network.\nIf you already have a compatible 3G (UMTS/W-CDMA 2100) or 4G mobile phone, you can roam onto Chinese networks, subject to network agreements, but calls will be very expensive (\u00a512\u201335/min is typical). Check with your home operator before you leave to be sure.\nRoaming data is not censored by the Chinese authorities, meaning you will be able to retain access to websites that otherwise would be blocked, without having to deal with getting a separate VPN. If your provider offers reasonably priced roaming in China, you should consider taking advantage. Alternatively, depending on if you are transiting somewhere before arriving in China, you may consider buying a SIM from there that roams in China at a discount. There is a wide selection in Hong Kong, Macau, and Southeast Asian countries as well as a few affordable options in certain parts of Europe (for example, Free Mobile in France includes 25GB of roaming in China per month on their 20\u20ac plan).\nIf you need a phone, prices start around \u00a5300 used or \u00a51000 new for a smartphone (as of 2020). Chinese phones, unlike those sold in some Western countries, are never \"locked\" and will work with any SIM card you put in them, but some phones don't have Google services or the Play. Some stores can install this for you at time of purchase, so you can ask. However, Google services sideloaded in this manner may not be as stable as when pre-installed as part of the system package. Phones purchased in China frequently come with built-in detection and censorship system of certain keywords that are deemed to be \"detrimental\" to the Chinese communist regime. The system cannot be uninstalled and some Western governments advise their citizens to avoid buying these phones.\nIf your provider doesn't offer affordable roaming, for a short visit, consider renting a Chinese mobile phone from a company such as Pandaphone. Rates are around \u00a57 a day. The company is based in the US but has staff in China. Toll-free numbers are \u260f +1-866-574-2050 in the U.S. or \u260f +86 400-820-0293 in China. The phone can be delivered to your hotel in China prior to your arrival and dropped off there at the end of your trip, or shipped to you in the US. When you rent the phone, they will offer you an access code for calling to your country, which is cheaper than buying a SIM card from a local vendor and dialling directly.\nIf you're staying for more than a few days, it will usually be cheaper to buy a prepaid Chinese SIM card; this gives you a Chinese phone number with a certain amount of money preloaded. Chinese tend to avoid phone numbers with the bad-luck digit '4', and vendors will often be happy to offload these \"unsellable\" SIM-cards to foreigners at a discount. \nMost shops selling SIM cards require a standard swipeable Chinese ID card (a citizen's ID card, or a foreigner's permanent-resident card) to purchase a SIM card. If you want to purchase a SIM card using a passport as your identity document, you may be asked to go to the cell-phone company's main office, probably somewhere in the city center. The staff will take your photograph for their record, along with the photocopy of your passport.\nChina's three big operators are China Mobile (Chinese only), China Unicom and China Telecom. Most SIMs sold by them work nationwide. Domestic roaming charges have largely been abolished, so you no longer need to worry about taking a SIM from one part of mainland China to another. Roaming in Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Macau, however, still requires a separate activation step and additional charges.\nInternational calls have to be enabled separately by applying for China Mobile's \"12593\" or China Unicom's \"17911\" service. Neither provider requires a deposit, though both require applications. Usually there will be an English speaker, so let him/her know what you want. Ask for the \"special\" dialing code, and for \u00a51/month extra, this will be provided to you. Enter the code, the country code, then the local number and you will be talking cheaply in no time. Don't be fooled by cellphone shops with the China Mobile signage: be sure to go a to a corporate store. The employees will wear a blue uniform and there will be counter services. China Mobile is the cheaper of the two with calls to North America and Asia around \u00a50.4/min. You can also use prepaid cards for international calling; just dial the number on the card as with a regular landline phone, and the charges will go to the prepaid calling card.\nTo recharge, visit the neighborhood office of your mobile service provider, give the staff your number and pay in cash to recharge your account. Alternately, many shops will sell you a charge card, which has a number and password that must be used to call the telephone company to recharge the money in your account. You will be calling a computer and the default language is Chinese, which can be changed to English if you understand the Chinese. Charge cards are sold in denominations of \u00a530, 50 and 100. (If you have WeChat Pay, this is a more convenient way to recharge your account, and foreign credit cards are accepted).\nFor mobile data addicts who are willing to deal with the Chinese website blocking, mobile data on local SIMs is cheaper than ever. China Mobile has 4G plans starting at \u00a529 for a low rate of \u00a50.10/minute voice and 3GB data with additional data costing only \u00a55/GB (as of 2021). Many locals have access to special online-only offers that provide a very large amount (or even unlimited) data for a low cost, but only some of these are accessible to foreigners; some can be purchased on top of any SIM if you have the carrier app installed (and can understand Chinese to use it), others require special online-only starter packs that foreigners can not purchase due to the requirement to submit a photo of a Chinese ID card when purchasing SIMs online. China Mobile only uses the \"standard\" LTE frequency bands of 3 and 8 in large cities and uses a different set of frequency bands for its data services outside major cities; if your phone does not support TD-LTE on bands 38, 39, 40, and 41 and you plan on going outside the biggest cities, then China Unicom or China Telecom is recommended instead.\nMany internationally widespread apps are banned in China, and Chinese people typically use Chinese apps that are sometimes close copies of their foreign equivalents instead. The most important is WeChat (\u5fae\u4fe1 W\u0113ix\u00ecn), which Chinese people use instead of the internationally popular WhatsApp. WeChat is a combination messaging app, social network, and mobile payment service, and downloading it is essential if you want to start making friends in China or stay in the country for an extended period. The interface can be set to English, Chinese, or various other languages.\n\n\nFax\nInternational fax (\u4f20\u771f Chu\u00e1nzh\u0113n) services are available in most large hotels for a fee of a dozen renminbi or more. Inexpensive faxes within China can be made in the ubiquitous photocopy outlets that have the Chinese characters for fax written on the front door.\n\n\nMail\nPostal services are provided by China Post, which is generally reliable and sometimes quick. There are a few things you need to adapt to:\n\nIncoming mail will be both faster and more reliable if the address is in Chinese. If not, the Post Office has people who will translate, but that takes time and is not 100% accurate.\nIf you don't know the exact postal code of where your recipient lives, you can fill in the first two digits (which correspond to the prefecture city/municipality/province), and fill the rest with 0s. Alternatively, you can search your destination's postal code at this website.\nIt will be helpful to provide the receiver's phone number with packages or expedited mail. The customs and delivery drivers usually need it.\nDo not seal outgoing packages before taking them to the Post Office; they will not send them without inspecting the contents. Generally it is best to buy the packing materials at the Post Office, and almost all Post Offices will pack your materials for you, at a reasonable price.\nMost Post Offices and courier services will refuse to send CDs or DVDs, this can be circumvented by placing them in CD wallets along with lots of other things and finally packing the space in with clothes, giving the appearance of sending your stuff home, it is also easier to send by sea as they care less.\nYour ID is now required when sending parcels. When sending parcels domestically, write the receiver's name correctly; it will be compared with their ID, as all parcels are now tracked end to end.\nHong Kong and Macau run their own postal services separately, so stamps from mainland China cannot be used to send mail from Hong Kong or Macau and vice versa.\n\n\nEmergency numbers\nThe following emergency telephone numbers work in all areas of China; calling them from a cell phone is free.\n\nPatrol Police: 110\nFire Department: 119\n(Government-owned) Ambulance/EMS: 120\n(some areas private-owned) Ambulance: 999\nTraffic Police: 122\nDirectory inquiries: 114\nConsumer Protection: 12315\n112 and 911 do not connect you to emergency service personnel.\nIt is also possible to contact the police by sending SMS message to 12110XXX, where XXX is the area code of the prefectural-level city you are located.
