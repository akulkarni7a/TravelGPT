It is 76 km from Riohacha.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThere is no ATM in the bus terminal, you'll have get a taxi driver to drive you to the city center.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Mosque of Omar Ibn Al-Khattab (Mezquita de Omar Ibn Al-Jattab). It stands out as one of the largest mosques in all of Latin America. The mosque was built in 1997 to accommodate the city's notable Arab and Muslim population, mostly composed of Lebanese immigrants, though their numbers have been dwindled. It's quite a beautiful site and a must-visit if you're in the area. Also referred to locally as Mezquita de Maicao.   \nThe Monumento a la Identidad is a sculpture made by Cartagena artist Alfredo Tatis Benzo. This monument is also known as \"El Abuelo de las Barbas del Ma\u00edz\" (lit.\u2009'The Grandfather of the Corn Beards') in reference to how Maicao received its name.\nThe Plaza Bolivar has a statue of Simon Bolivar by the artist of the municipality, Vespaciano Ruiz Pich\u00f3n.\nSan Jos\u00e9 Church  is the patron saint of the municipality.\n\n\nDo\nMaicao is a great border town. Everything is for sale here, most of it of dubious legality. The city sits on one point of a triangular shaped smuggling operation. Home appliances and large goods come here via Panama, offloaded at the port of Puerto Bolivar. Gas, food and other subsidized goods come over the border from Venezuela, using primarily Indian footpaths.\n\nA trip to the vast market is a must for any visitor. Everything from fake iPods, to outdated American department store merchandise and Amazonian fruits is on offer. Negotiate hard.\n1 Montes de Oca Natural Reserve (in the township of Carraip\u00eda, south of Maicao). This protected area has at least 14,400 hectares, and is the source of water for part of the population of Maicao. There are approximately 200 types of plants and 177 species of birds. Montes de Oca is home to endangered forest species such as Guayac\u00e1n.  \n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\nThe trading atmosphere of Maicao means a broader range of options than elsewhere in the region. Of particular note are the two Arab restaurants in town, which serve reasonable shawarma, chicken, and hummus, along with fries.\nOther options include roast chicken, soups, with both Colombian and Venezuelan flavors.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nGo next",
