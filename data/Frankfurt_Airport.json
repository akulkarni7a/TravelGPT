  "extract": "Frankfurt Airport (German: Flughafen Frankfurt am Main; FRA  IATA) is the largest airport in Germany and a global aviation hub on the outskirts of Frankfurt am Main in the state of Hesse.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nFrankfurt Airport is among the busiest in Europe, fourth in passenger traffic after London Heathrow Airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport; it is also the twelfth  busiest airport in the world. This is due to various factors: Frankfurt is Germany's financial capital, and is centrally between western Germany's major metropolitan regions (the Ruhr and Munich).\nFrankfurt is the main hub of German flag carrier Lufthansa. Lufthansa and the airport have had a symbiotic relationship for decades and both have grown enormously as a result. Lufthansa holds some shares in the airport, with most of it still publicly owned (Lufthansa was fully privatized in the 1990s but retains informal political connections). Most of Lufthansa's long-haul flights originate or terminate in Frankfurt. Many other airlines also serve the airport, including almost all other Star Alliance carriers. Easyjet and Wizz Air are the no frills airlines with a minor presence at the airport; Ryanair no longer operates here. Lufthansa still flies all domestic routes to and from Frankfurt despite having transferred other domestic routes to its subsidiary Eurowings. Lufthansa also uses some ICE trains from Stuttgart and Cologne as \"feeder flights\" to the airport as part of its air rail alliance with Deutsche Bahn.\n\n\nFlights\n\n\nTerminals\nThe airport has two terminals, with a third scheduled to open in 2026. Frankfurt Airport is still in the same place where it was built in the 1930s, and the main Terminal 1 opened in 1972. This means capacity increases have been achieved by constantly improving and expanding existing infrastructure, so Frankfurt Airport is in many ways quite compromised and not as efficient or pleasant as newer German airports, such as Munich Airport.\nAll Airlines A-Z Terminals Halle on Airport Frankfurt Airport\n\n\nTerminal 1\nTerminal 1 is separated into Concourses A (inside Schengen passport control), Z (the level on top of A, Non-Schengen passport control), B and C (which seems to be for certain destinations with higher security requirements such as Israel, with the exception of Schengen gate C1). Be aware that if you are changing planes to an international flight on a Z gate, you will be required to go through a checkpoint where you present your passport before you get to the concourse.\nTerminal 1 is a multi-level maze with poor signage. Level 1 is arrivals, Level 2 check-in and departure, Level 3 is an access bridge to hotels and the long-distance rail station, Level 0 has access to parking, below which is the regional rail station. Lufthansa tries to reduce confusion for Business Class passengers (and Gold & Silver Star Alliance card holders): they have a designated check-in area in Terminal 1 A. First class passengers of Lufthansa and Swiss, as well as Lufthansa HON Circle card holders, are allowed to check-in in the first class terminal on the right side of Terminal 1, which has its own driveway. All Star Alliance economy class travellers and other Star Alliance partners are checked in in Terminal 1B & 1C.\n\n\nDepartures\nTerminal 1: Schengen flights use gates A and B1-B19. Non-Schengen flights depart from gates Z (access from Level 3 after passport control, utilizes the same A gates), B20-B63 (access from B concourse passing the Schengen gates) and C.\nTerminal 2: Departures is on zone D and E at levels 2 and 3. If you are travelling on a non-Schengen flight, you must clear passport control at Level 3 and the securities are right before the gates.\nIf you have difficulty walking, request assistance getting to the departure gate, it can be up to a kilometer away. Once you pass the passport control for non-Schengen flights, you will not be able to return to the Schengen area.\n\nYou can check on departures in real time at: Departures Frankfurt Airport\n\n\nArrivals\nNot all planes park at a gate and you will often have to take a bus to get you from the plane to the terminal. If you are in a hurry, rushing off the plane does not always make things quicker, being last on the bus standing next to the door is key. Sometimes for flights with tight connection times you have to take a different bus from the tarmac.\nIf you are a frequent user of Terminal 1B you can make passport control quicker by applying for retina recognition. Next to passport manual check control, where there are often long queues, there is a machine which can scan your passport and then your eyes. To register there is an office in the corner of Terminal 1 landside, section A level 2. Terminal 1Z has automatic face recognition machines which will work with new European passports.\nOn arriving at Terminal 1Z and 1B do not be surprised to have to ascend and descend many stairs, or with Terminal 1A expect a long walk. When coming into 1B you enter the main concourse before baggage claim. Look for the escalators heading down in the middle of hall B.\n\nYou can check on arrivals in real time at: Arrivals Frankfurt Airport\n\n\nTerminal transfers\nAll concourses at both terminals are connected (both landside and airside) by a free Sky Train (monorail). There is also a free shuttle bus. Luggage carts are not allowed on the Sky Train.\nThe transfer between Terminal 1 and 2 on foot takes around 15 minutes.\n\n\nGround transportation\nSituated in the center of Germany, the airport has good connections to the whole country and is a stepping stone to other parts of Europe and the world.\n\n\nBy train\nFrankfurt airport has two dedicated railway stations, one for regional trains (S-Bahn, RE) and one for long-distance high-speed trains (ICE/IC). Regional trains from Frankfurt and other local towns come into the Regionalbahnhof on the lowest level of Terminal 1 and have two sets of escalators to check-in. Long distance trains arrive at the international station which is connected to Terminal 1 by a walkway (5 to 10 minutes).\n\n\nRegional trains\nThe regional train station, 1 Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Regionalbahnhof.   , with convenient connections to the city of Frankfurt and other local towns and cities, is on the lowest level of Terminal 1 (entrances in section A and B).\nTo get to the city with the S-Bahn (fast commuter train), take lines  S8  or  S9  in the direction of Offenbach Ost and Hanau. If you want to go downtown, get off at Frankfurt Taunusanlage, Frankfurt Hauptwache or Frankfurt Konstablerwache, which are in the heart of the city. If you want to change to long-distance trains get off at Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (Frankfurt Central Station) or Frankfurt S\u00fcdbahnhof (Frankfurt South Station). The ride from the airport to the central station takes around 20 minutes. Be sure to purchase a ticket at the vending machines in the train station before boarding the train. The adult ticket costs \u20ac5.80 and \u20ac3.40 for children (April 2023). Day tickets are usually profitable up from the second travel within the respective zones. Check the RMV webpage and Frankfurt#By public transport for journey and ticket details.\nTo get to the airport with the S-Bahn, take the S8 or S9 in the direction of Wiesbaden or Mainz. Don't take the  S1  \u2014 while it has the same general direction and leaves the central station at the same platform, it will go along the wrong side of the river Main. The line S1 does not stop at the airport.\nRegional-Express trains (RE) to Mainz, Frankfurt Hbf, Frankfurt-S\u00fcd and Hanau stop at the same place as the S-Bahn.\n\n\nLong-distance trains\n\nThe long-distance train station, 2 Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Fernbahnhof.   , was built after the Regionalbahnhof when traffic levels grew beyond the capacities of the latter. It is one of only two train stations in Germany only served by long-distance (Intercity and ICE) trains. The station is in a separate structure reached via a walkway above Hall A at Terminal 1 check-in hall or shuttle bus from Terminal 2. The walk to the terminals is marginally longer than from the regional station, but this is balanced by the numerous direct connections to places as far away as Munich, Amsterdam and Basel. There's also an Austrian Nightjet sleeper train two nights a week, north to Brussels and south to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck.\nAfter disembarking from the train and following the signs of the airport, turn right for the Level 3 and the check-in halls of Terminal 1 or turn left for the shuttle to Terminal 2 and the arrival level of Terminal 1.\n\n\nBy car\nThe airport is in the south-west quadrant of Frankfurter Kreuz the Autobahn intersection of the A3 and A5; the busiest motorway intersection in Europe.\nTerminal 1 and Terminal 2 are reached by separated exits of the (B)43. Drop off is possible in-front of both terminals just outside of check-in halls; simply follow the signs for the required terminal (Departure:Abflug, Arrivals:Ankunft), but there is a 15-minute limit on waiting which is controlled and it is often very difficult to find a space.\nFor parking in Terminal 1: P1 is closest to check-in (5 minutes walk) being only one floor above or below entry to the main complex. P2/3 and P5 are also close but add an extra 5 minutes waiting for the elevator. Parking for Terminal 2 is conveniently under the check-in hall. Special parking spaces are available for barrier-free travel (P4 and P8), women (P1-5 and P8) and motorcycles (free parking near arrival hall C). Vehicles taller than 2.10 m will not fit into the regular parking facilities \u2013 use the bus parking at P36 instead. Be aware that individual parking spaces tend to be quite narrow (between 2.30 and 2.50 m). If you need extra width, consider using the slightly more expensive P1 and P4.\nAlthough the long distance rail station and Hilton hotel can be clearly seen from the Autobahn, getting to them is not self-explanatory. To park there follow signs to The Squaire and take a short monorail trip. If you're just dropping someone off, go westbound on the B 43, just after the Terminal 2 exit get in the far left lane.\nThere is also holiday parking south of the airport on Airportring and a number of private long-stay parking facilities in surrounding towns and suburbs of Frankfurt such as in Frankfurt-Niederrad.\nOccasionally the Autobahn is clogged with traffic. A few tips for getting round the jams:\n\nFrom the north if hold-ups on the A5 or from the north-west if the A3 is blocked, take the A66 to the (B)40 direction Kelsterbach. This road will get you to the access roads, K823 Airportring, from where you can get to the terminals.\nFrom west if the A67/A3 is block and from the south if the A5 is blocked take the (B)486 to M\u00f6rfelden. Take Virolles-Ring, the first(last) road on the west of the village. This will get you to Airportring, but as it has to go round the runway and has a number of speed cameras on the route only use if the autobahn is a total standstill.\nFrom the East when the A3 is busy there is little alternative; the only possibility is to head into Frankfurt and get onto the (B)43 from there.\n\n\nBy rental car\nMost major car rental companies have offices in Terminal 1 level 0 section A and in Terminal 2 just after arrivals baggage exit.\nIf you are new to driving in Germany, this is a baptism of fire. The airport is at the crossroads of the A3 and A5 providing you with good access to all of Germany and Central Europe.\nCar return is to the airport parking: for Terminal 1 P30; for Terminal 2 P8. There is an Esso fuel station hidden on the traffic island off the B43 exit to Terminal 2 and a Shell on Airportring west of Terminal 1, neither of which you will find using the normal approaches to the airport. Unfortunately there are no other fuel stations near the airport so best to refuel at the service stations on the autobahns or head into a nearby town such as Frankfurt, R\u00fcsselsheim, Kelsterbach or Langen if you have time.\n\n\nBy bus\nTake bus line 61 to Frankfurt S\u00fcdbahnhof (Frankfurt South Station).\n3 Frankfurt Airport intercity bus station (Terminal 1)\nSome European long distance buses and Intercity buses in Germany (e.g. Flixbus) stop at the airport although more serve a stop closer to Frankfurt's main station. The pick-up and drop off point is car park P36 which is outside just north east of Terminal 1 (arrivals level). It is within walking distance of Terminal 1, there are also airport shuttle buses to and from the area to the terminals. At the airport bus station there is only a small toilet area and an outside seating area.\nThere are some airport shuttles, particularly to/from Hahn.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThis is a large airport to walk around on both sides of border control. If you are looking for shops and restaurants landside of border control, consider that the closest options may be on one of the levels above or below you in both terminals.\nThere is a people mover and a bus between Terminals 1 and 2. When changing terminals by bus make sure to use the yellow terminal shuttle buses, as they are free of charge. There are public buses that connect both terminals on their way to Frankfurt or other surrounding cities, however to ride them you need a valid ticket. Getting caught on one of these buses without a ticket will result in a \u20ac60 fine. If you are unsure about the buses, the \"SkyLine\" people mover is always free of charge.\nIf you are departing with a non-Schengen flight, in Terminal 1 you will have to first go through security and will find yourself at the Schengen terminal, after which you will have to pass passport control which leads to the non-Schengen part of the airport.\n\n\nWait\n\n\nLounges\nThese lounges are also accessible to all passengers for a fee:\n\n LUXX Lounge (Terminal 1, between concourses B and C - gallery level, next to the Travel Market). 07:00-19:00 daily.

In other words, it is a fairly boring place to spend hours waiting for your plane. If you are departing on a flight that leaves Europe, there are several options to choose from.\n\n\nLonger stays\nIf your layover is very long, you may be interested in the nearby bird reserve, the Schwanheimer D\u00fcne (Dunes of Schwanheim).\n\n\nEat and drink\n\n\nTerminal 1\nThere are many possibilities both sides of border control in Terminal 1.

Opened end of 2019 on the  S8  or  S9  line. Less than 5 minutes from the airport regional station.   (updated Jan 2020)\n\n\nNiederrad\nMany hotels billed as \"Frankfurt Airport\" are in the district of Frankfurt-Niederrad between the airport and city proper.\nFrankfurt-Niederrad S-bahn is just three stations away from the airport station (and on some regional trains is the only stop before the city centre). The hotels are within walking distance of the train station, but most at a distance you would not want to drag a suitcase.\n\n\nNearby\nMainz and its surrounding area is a more pleasant area to stay than the airport's environs but it is on the other side of the Rhine, and the limited bridge crossings could lead to your being stuck in a traffic jam on your way back to the airport - potentially problematic for morning flights.  However there are direct and reliable train connections to the airport, making Mainz nearly as convenient as Frankfurt.\nIf your final destination is not Frankfurt but another city in Germany it is often better to take the train than get a connecting flight. In bad weather the first thing that happens is that inland flights are stopped. Also check with your airline (or with Deutsche Bahn) whether they offer rail&fly, which means that your plane ticket includes a train ride both to and from your airport in Germany connecting to any train station in Germany as well as Basel (CH) and Salzburg (AT). This is often the cheapest and most comfortable option and sometimes even faster overall.\nIf you have a connecting flight that is cancelled due to strike or bad weather check with your airline or with Deutsche Bahn whether they have a good for train agreement in place. Domestic connections should not be a problem at all, but they can sometimes offer you inner-European connections as well. If you have reason to believe that you will be held up for two or more days even long distance train rides become an option if they are available with your ticket. Some airlines offer this service for flights to and from Germany but others don't, so check in advance. More information at rail air alliances.",
