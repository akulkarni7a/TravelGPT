  "extract": "Cycling allows you to see places close up and at a slower pace. It keeps you aware of your surroundings and you get to experience a place more intimately than you would as a bus or taxi passenger. You'll see more of street life and meet people going about their daily business.  It is also a great way to return from your holidays fitter and healthier than when you left, and puts less burden on the environment.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe bicycle can be used as a vehicle for transportation, as well as a piece of sport equipment.\nFor tourists and adventurers, there are definitely better and worse places to cycle, but there's not many places you can't reach by bike. The good news is that cycling is becoming easier in many western countries for both getting around town or for long distance touring. In Europe, Canada, the U.S. and Australia, money is being invested in converting old railways, building dedicated cycleways and putting in cycle lanes on busy roads. In Asia and Africa, the pattern is very different. In China, Vietnam and India, the bicycle was often the dominant mode of transport. Here, cycling is in decline, and has been thought of as a sign of past poverty. There are some signs of a return to bike transport in these countries, because of congestion and health benefits, particularly in China. Even in India, cycling is beginning to benefit as it is taken up by parts of the middle classes. Somewhat surprisingly, the bicycle has long been marginalized in Africa, despite being a cheap way to provide local mobility.\n\n\nUrban cycling\nMain article: Urban cycling\nCities offer many opportunities for cycle tourism, especially in places that provide for it. In some cities cycling is the preferred method of locals to commute, run their errands and get to leisure activities.  Some cities have designated bicycle paths, and even bike sharing programs for short-term bike rental (minutes or hours) as well as rental for hours or days in shops.  See Bike rental below.\n\n\nTour cycling\n\nMain article: Tour cycling\nTour cycling is cycling as a means of transportation over long distances, over one or several days. Touring is quite a popular kind of adventure holiday, and you can find many blogs detailing people's experiences, cycling independently in places you really wouldn't expect.\nCorrectly packed bikes can be taken on most trains, ferries and planes, and even sometimes on buses. In some countries a bike can often be taken aboard as is.\nYou can tour by yourself, or you can go with a commercial guided tour. These have the advantage of making all the logistical and accommodation arrangements, and usually bringing your luggage along in a van, but can be very pricey.\n\n\nMountain biking\nMain article: Mountain biking\nHilly, less accessible places make exhilarating riding, but you will want a bike built for it. If you are going off public roads, check the relevant legislation (e.g. in England biking is allowed along public bridleways, but not along public footpaths).\n\n\nSport cycling\nCycling can also be pursued as an amateur sport. There are open annual events around the world, such as V\u00e4tternrundan, part of the Swedish Classic Circuit.\nCycling is also pursued as a professional sport, with the pinnacle of the sport being the Three Grand Tours namely the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, the Giro d'Italia and the most prestigious of them all, the Tour de France, all of which are broadcast on television. Cycling is also contested at the Olympics, where it is divided into four disciplines: road cycling, track cycling, mountain biking and BMX.\n\n\nGet in\n\nIn some cases a traveler may be able to bring a bicycle from home, by cycling or by loading it on private or public transport. Otherwise you need to rent or buy at the destination.\nBringing the bike on buses and trains can be one of the fastest and cheapest ways to move out from a large urban area towards a rural one, and sometimes over long distances. Also taking your bike on a plane may be possible. However, the transportation system is quite heterogeneous in terms of rules, comfort and experience.\nOn flights and other intercity transport, the handlebars and pedals often need to be turned or removed to fit the bicycle into a \"bike box\". Airlines may or may not accommodate bikes; exact policies vary and change so much that you should rather check with your airline directly.\n\n\nBy plane\nMain article: Flying with bicycles\nAirlines may require any or all of the following: that you fix the pedals in position; that you lower the pressure in your tires (emptying them entirely leaves the rims with little protection). To give your bike good protection it's best to pack your bicycle in a special box (most bike shops are happy to give you the sturdy cardboard box bicycles are delivered to them in), and the airlines often require this. Airlines vary about permitting a bicycle as a free item of checked baggage: some allow this, some require that you pay an extra fee. Shop around before buying a ticket. In almost all cases you need to inform the airline in advance that you wish to check a bicycle. Read the regulations yourself before checking in, as the airline's staff may attempt to charge you when the bicycle should be carried for free. To pack a bicycle back into a shop-box you will need to remove the pedals and front wheel, and remove or rotate the handlebars.  Larger boxes and bags can be purchased if the size is acceptable to the airline.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nBuses may have luggage compartments under the seating area, a cargo areas inside the bus, or roof-racks, all of which may accommodate only one or two bikes or several, or they might not carry bicycles at all. Buses may also require a bike to be dismantled and placed in a case or box. Again, check when planning your route, and at least when booking.\n\n\nBy train\nTrains may have lots of space for bicycles, for example if they include baggage cars, and at the opposite extreme they may not carry them at all. If the train requires that you book a seat, you may need to inform them at the time of booking that you will be carrying a bicycle, and it may need to be boxed. If you're travelling on a service that doesn't require booking try to avoid peak times; many commuter services either charge extra for bicycles at peak times, allow bikes only outside rush hours, or simply do not have room in the carriages for bicycles. Commuter trains may have onboard racks inside the car. Folding bikes may sometimes be easier to get aboard a train, but you may not want to do a cycling trip of any length on a folding bike.\n\n\nBy boat\nFerries tend to be a very bike-friendly form of transport and most will carry bicycles without a problem. Some will charge a small extra fee for this. On a car ferry, you will usually ride on and off with the rest of the vehicles and be directed to an area where you can place your bike, normally with ropes to secure it. Some ferry companies will let you leave panniers on the bike during the voyage, but be sure to take everything you need for the crossing, and anything valuable.\n\n\nThe bicycle\n\nThere are several bicycle models. Those which are most commonly used for personal transportation are:\n\nA utility bicycle is a traditional bicycle model suitable for urban cycling. It usually ships with a bell, a stand, a rack, and other equipment absent on racers and mountain bikes. It has a simple gear system or no gears at all.\nA racing bicycle is made for road cycling, usually with narrow tires inflated to a high pressure, which gets uncomfortable with even slight bumps in the road. Often built for light weight above everything.\nA mountain bike is made for offroad cycling. If they are fitted with lights, a bell and other safety equipment, they are useful for urban cycling as well.\nA cargo bike has a cargo hold in the front, which can also be used for a passenger.\nAn electric bicycle has a supportive electric motor. They may or may not be legal on bike trails depending on local laws and the speed at which the electric assistance switches off. In the EU, for example, Pedal-assisting electric bikes are designated as bikes if they only assist up to 25 km/h, but are considered mopeds at higher speeds. It may be possible to use it like a bike without turning on the motor.\nAn electric kickbike can be available in some bikeshare schemes, and a very casual option for urban cycling.\nA personal transporter is an electric personal vehicle, including brands such as Segway and Hoverboard. In many jurisdictions, they are classified as bicycles.\nA beach cruiser has very wide tires and is best adapted to loose soils and lower speeds. Some bikeshare bikes fall under this category.\nA fat bike has even wider tires, for loose soil.\nA rickshaw is used to carry one or a few passengers, usually as a taxi service.\nA folding bicycle can be folded to fit into a small space.\nThere is also often a difference made between \"men's bikes\" and \"women's bikes\". The main difference is in the frame, which is better adapted to riding with a skirt in the case of women's bicycles. Sometimes they may also have slightly different saddles, but if you plan to spend much time in the saddle, you should get one fit individually for you.\n\n\nBike rental\nSee also: Urban cycling#Bike sharing programs\n\nInstead of bringing your own bike, you can rent a bike in most towns, for a few hours, a day or longer. Price per hour usually goes down quickly as rental time increases. Places to ask include bike shops, tourist businesses and tourist information points. Think beforehand about what type of bike and what equipment you need. Some firms charge extra for racks, headlights and locks even when such are more or less necessary. Some equipment you find necessary may not be easily available.\nThere are two fundamentally different brake systems: hand brakes and foot brakes. The former are used on nearly all sport bikes, while the latter are the ones used on robust gearless bikes. Three-gear bikes (for everyday use) also have foot brakes, often complemented with a hand brake for the front wheel. If you are used only to one system, be careful if you rent one with the other, at least until you have got your reflexes working.\nSimilarly there are internal gears (on three-gear bikes) and external gears. Changing gear requires slightly different techniques (stopping your feet for a moment or moving them gently while the gear changes).\nSometimes it is cheaper to buy a used bike locally than to bring your own or rent. These may be available, e.g. at thrift shops, pawn shops, and garage sales. Many cities also have semi-regular auctions of bikes abandoned on the street, which can be good deals, but are often frequented by professional resellers who drive prices. Check the condition, as fixing any fault can be inconvenient and time consuming when you do not have the needed tools, and new spares can easily cost as much as the bike itself.\nIn some cases buying a new bike can be an option, if you know you will find what you are looking for and are going on a longer tour. Bikes do drastically use value from \"new\" to \"used\" even after only a couple hundred kilometers or a few months of use, so trying to sell a used bike will almost always net you a significant loss over your initial purchase price; do not base you budget on recouping most of the investment in a new bike.\n\n\nEquipment\nSome bicycles are delivered without equipment which is mandatory or recommended, such as a bell, lamps, and luggage carriers. Riding a bike without proper equipment can give a fine, or put the rider in danger. Make sure you get the bike equipped for street use.\n\n\nMaps and routes\nCycling information and routes are usually found online, often from local authorities websites.  OpenStreetMap has user compiled cycling routes available rendered as a layer on its main website, and cycling routing maps available to download to Garmin devices that you can mount on your bike.  There are many apps that can be downloaded to smartphones that take advantage of OSM data.\nGoogle Maps has a cycle route layer, and both Google and Apple Maps have cycling directions.\n\n\nCycling organizations\nSimilar to motorists, cyclists have formed associations for mutual assistance as well as political lobbying soon after the invention of modern cycling. Some organizations in fact date back to before the first motorist associations. Besides political advocacy, they usually offer roadside assistance, maps for cycling trips, lists of \"bike-friendly\" accommodation, discounts with their partners and a newsletter. Other minor benefits may be included as well. The biggest associations usually exist in countries with a healthy cycling tradition and most European cycling clubs cooperate in the European Cyclist Federation. In the USA the League of American Bicyclists that was founded (under a different name) in 1880 is the major nationwide cycling organization.\nMany cyclist organizations evaluate the \"bicycle-friendliness\" of cities in regular intervals. Cities are judged along criteria such as public policy, availability of facilities, the general attitude towards cycling and other factors. As these reports are intended to shape public policy they are usually available for free in their entirety. They are a good resource to determine where cycling is a breeze and where it is a challenge.\n\n\nDestinations\nYou can bike anywhere, but there are places where cycling is particularly good or easy. These are some of the more popular destinations and cycle routes, to give you a taste of what's possible.\n\n\nAfrica\nSee also: Cycling the Western Sahara\nCycling in Africa has declined, and is below western levels in most countries. This seems to be in part because of poor infrastructure design in most cities and a perception of cycling as dangerous or as associated with poverty. Cape Town has a few cycle paths and lanes, but it is an exception even in South Africa.\nCycling the length of the African continent is one of the great touring challenges. Heat, disease, wild animals, poor roads, bike maintenance and logistical challenges stack up against experiencing the extraordinary landscapes and peoples.\nIn Madagascar cycling is still a good way to explore the country, but be wary of poor infrastructure.\n\n\nMauritius\nCycling is ambivalent in Mauritius; while it is a means of transportation for the poorest in countryside\u2019s villages, a sporty cycling scene is emerging in the more affluent areas. A few mountain and road bike races are held annually. \nGiven its small size (~2000 km\u00b2), crossing the island by bicycle is doable in one day. From Souillac (southernmost point) to Cap Malheureux (northernmost point) there are around 80 km.  The east and west coast are about 50 km apart. However, being a volcanic island, Mauritius' central plateau culminates at ~500 m. The south west of the island has more relief than the north which is flatter.  Therefore, depending on the area traveled, a good physical condition is required.\nThe road network is in an overall good state but potholes are unavoidable especially when crossing villages. Older roads tend to be quite narrow and may represent a safety risk for cyclists when being overtaken by careless drivers. However, Mauritian drivers are usually respectful of cyclists. There could be high traffic on some roads (especially the west coast road from Port Louis to Tamarin). There are only limited cycle paths separated from the main axes. A cycle road from Curepipe (central plateau) to Flic en Flac is being built (as of 2024) with the section between Curepipe and La Marie already in use. Cycling at your own risk is allowed on the highway.\nThe use of mountain bikes permits avoiding main roads through shortcuts in the sugar fields and will render the experience more pleasant by allowing exploration of hidden places.\nA negligible threat can be encountered in the form of packs of stray dogs. While being peaceful most of the time, some may start to chase the cyclist, pulling the entire pack with them. In this case, slow down, dismount, talk to them and walk until you exit their territory. Athletes may attempt to outrun them by sprinting, but a very good condition is required.\n\n\nAsia\n\n\nChina\n\nSee also: Cycling in China\nChina still has a high proportion of cyclists, although traffic can be dangerous. Cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Suzhou continue to have very good cycle infrastructure, even if car traffic is much more dominant than it once was. There is a 70 km segregated cycle lane between Shanghai and Suzhou. \nThe Yunnan-Tibet Highway has become a particularly popular challenge for touring cyclists. The end part of route isn't easily navigable for foreigners, however, because of restrictions on entry to Tibet, but it still possible to cycle on that route if you make arrangements through a local travel agency in advance. See also Yunnan tourist trail and Overland to Tibet.\nThe Karakoram Highway leading south from western China to Pakistan is a popular, though very challenging, cycle route.\nCycling across Tibet is possible, but foreigners are required to join an organized tour to do so. There are several Tibetan tour companies that specialize in cycling tours.\n\n\nHong Kong\nHong Kong is in general less bike-friendly than the mainland; there is a lack of cycling paths in the downtown areas, as well as a general lack of consideration for cyclists from motorists. However, cycling is an excellent way to savour the scenic landscapes of rural Hong Kong, with a network of dedicated long-distance cycling paths across the New Territories stretching 60 km from Tuen Mun in the east to Ma On Shan in the west. Southern Lantau Island can also be a good place to cycle as motor vehicle traffic is heavily restricted on the roads there, though the mountainous terrain can make it a challenge for those who are not physically in top shape.\nYou are not allowed to cycle across the border from mainland China, but you can bring a bicycle across the border through the Lo Wu crossing onto the MTR provided the front wheel is removed. You can alight at Sheung Shui station and continue the rest of your journey by bicycle if you wish.\n\n\nJapan\nSee also: Cycling in Japan\nJapan can be a good place for cycling. Drivers are more polite than almost anywhere else and cycling is quite common in some cities, like Kyoto. There are many well-known, well-supported bike routes like the island-hopping Shimanami Kaido Bikeway that connects the main island of Honshu to Shikoku.\nNearly every large city and many small cities have bike rental options, usually for a single day at a time but longer rental options are sometimes available. In areas with well-known and popular cycling routes, there are certain to be places to rent bicycles, so it is not necessary to bring a bike to Japan unless you are planning more original routes or traveling across country.\n\n\nSingapore\nSingapore may not be the most bike-friendly place in the world, but things are improving. Dedicated bicycle lanes are rare on public roads, and there is a general lack of consideration for cyclists from motorists. However, Singapore has a network of off-road cycling paths that can be a good way to explore the city state's hinterland, with a number of park connectors that link the various parks that dot the island nation, as well as the Rail Corridor from north to south largely along the path of the now-decomissioned Malaysian railway line.\nAll cyclists riding on public roads are required by law to wear a helmet, while a white front light and red rear light are mandatory if you are cycling at night. Cyclists are also prohibited from all expressways, road tunnels and certain specific viaducts.\nIf you are coming from Malaysia, you can cycle across the Causeway into Singapore; use the motorcycle lanes and complete your immigration formalities at the manned motorcycle counters on each side. Bicycles are prohibited from crossing the Second Link as it is served by expressways on both sides.\n\n\nTaiwan\nCycling in Taiwan is improving,  with new cycle paths, but driving standards are quite poor. Kaohsiung has 150 km of cycle lanes and a city bike hire scheme.\nThe Taiwanese government has been encouraging cycling as a green form of recreation, and there is now a network of long-distance cycling routes, and a government web-site where you can search for them. The centrepiece is the Taiwan Cycle Route No. 1 (\u74b0\u5cf61\u865f\u7dda) that circumnavigates the entire island, covering about 958km.\n\n\nThailand\nThe Samoeng Loop is a 100-km ride that departs Chiang Mai, heads into the mountains to the west, and loops back to the city. Popular with bicyclists and motorcycle aficionados alike.\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nOne of only three countries in the world which mandates bicycle helmet wearing for all ages (the others being Australia and New Zealand) and, of course, it can be hellishly hot. Fuel and air conditioned vehicles are as cheap here as anywhere in the world and both recreational and commuter cycling is paltry.\n\n\nVietnam\nMost people still use bicycles in Vietnam, so cycling there can be a good choice. However motorised traffic is rapidly coming to dominate Vietnam's roads, especially near Saigon, meaning it is no longer the cycling paradise it perhaps once was.\nNational Highway 1 is a well-known route for long cycle tours, being Vietnam's main north-south road. There are plans to upgrade it to a six lane highway however, so it may not be a great route for much longer. The southern 1,100 km tends to be more popular, as it is reputedly more scenic and include long stretches of beach.\nA popular alternative is to choose parts of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which was the network of supply routes used by the Communist north to supply their troops in the south during the Vietnam War. This takes in the rural areas, crosses into Laos, and is much tougher cycling.\n\n\nPakistan\nCycling in Pakistan is very common. Cyclists often cycle the Karakoram Highway through the Hunza Valley in Pakistan to China. The Khunjerab Pass, at 4863 m, is the highest paved international border crossing in the world and the highest point on the Karakoram Highway. Organised tours and books about the journey are available.\n\n\nIndia\nCycling in India is very common, and is becoming more popular as a leisure activity. There a number of informally known routes that are popular, but few that are officially designated. A few areas and routes worth mentioning would include:\n\nManali to Leh \u2014 around 500 km through parts of the Himalayas\nGujarat\nSikkim\nAlibag coastal, flat, prone to wind\nPune to Panshet Dam taking in Sinhagarh Fort\nKerala\nBangalore\n\n\nAustralasia and Oceania\n\n\nAustralia\nSee also: Cycling in New South Wales\nAustralia is making efforts to improve cycling, and cities like Brisbane have better routes and city hire schemes. Australia was the first country in the world to impose uniform national mandatory bicycle helmet legislation, beginning in 1990, and it is illegal to ride without a helmet (except that in the Northern Territory there is an exemption for adults cycling along footpaths or on cycle paths).\nFormer railway lines in all states of Australia have been developed into rail trails. There is rail trail information available for the following regions of Australia:\n\nNew South Wales\nQueensland\nSouth Australia\nTasmania\nVictoria\nWestern Australia\nVictoria is a particularly good state to explore by bike, with a variety of scenery, many rail trails and a good public transport network.\n\n\nNew Zealand\nCycling is not a major commuter activity in New Zealand (except in Nelson), although it is increasingly popular as a sport and leisure activity and mountain biking is particularly well developed in Nelson.\nBeware of buses and trucks on main roads as many drivers will not give you sufficient overtaking clearance; proportionately, five times as many cyclists are injured and killed on New Zealand roads as in the Netherlands or Singapore! You should also be prepared for the large distances between towns and cities and the generally windy weather. While there are some areas of New Zealand that are flat, most tourists cycling in New Zealand will find that they need to be able to cope with long hill climbs and variable weather conditions.\nA network of cycleways is being built around New Zealand, with some safe and beautiful routes already constructed:  NZ Cycleways. Helmets must be worn by law.\n\n\nEurope\nMain article: Cycling in Europe\n\nMost Western and Central European countries have well-developed tourist routes, in addition to commuter cycling in cities. Netherlands and Denmark are especially well-known for their bicycle infrastructure. In France, cycling is a national sport, although cycling in most cities is not as good as in northern Europe. Bike-share schemes have become increasingly common in European cities. See the \"get around\" sections of the corresponding city articles for more detail on that.\n\nCycling in the Netherlands\nCycling in the Achterhoek\nCycling in Denmark\nCycling in Copenhagen\nCycling in Germany\nCycling in Sweden\nCycling in Switzerland\nCycling in England and Wales\nCycling in Scotland\n\n\nMiddle East\n\n\nBeirut\nBeirut's downtown has a car-free Sunday.\n\n\nJordan\nPetra & Wadi Rum\n\n\nNorth America\n\n\nCanada\nOttawa, Vancouver and Montreal have good and developing systems of local bike routes. Edmonton in the Prairies and Victoria in the West are said to be among the most bike-friendly in the country.\n\n\nTouring in Canada\nThe following are Canadian cycling routes:\n\nThe Trans Canada Trail is a set of linking trails connecting east, west and north Canada.\nThe Route Verte has 4,600 km (3,059 mi) of tracks in Quebec, including leisure and commuter routes. It is claimed to be the most extensive network in North America.\n\n\nUSA\nMain article: Cycling in the United States\nAlthough car culture is strong in the United States, cycling does exist in the country. Cycling is especially popular in Portland and Minneapolis, and other cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Boston, and Fort Collins have decent cycling options. There are also several long bicycle trails in the United States which are all at least a thousand miles long.\n\n\nMexico\nRuta de los Conventos del Popocat\u00e9petl \u2014 A challenging week long bicycle tour visiting the earliest 16th-century monasteries on the slopes of Popocat\u00e9petl. Along the way you\u2018ll cross two national parks, an active volcano, and more historical sites than any reasonable person would ever want to visit.\n\n\nCentral America and the Caribbean\n\n\nNicaragua\nIn Nicaragua cycling is a good way to get around medium sized towns like Le\u00f3n and Granada, whereas Managua is anything but a bike-friendly destination. Traditionally locals prefer motorcycles if they can afford them, but poverty means that you will be seeing bikes and even horse-drawn carts and horses on city streets, flowing through normal traffic. Most cities and many hotels have bike rentals for around US$10/day or less and you can buy a cheap bike even in remote places like San Carlos, Rio San Juan starting around US$70\u2013100. Traffic on most highways is not that high, but then again, neither is the quality of roads. Drivers are accustomed to sharing the road with horses and pedestrians so as long as you are visible enough they should be able to react accordingly. Keep in mind that city-drivers, and especially those driving a taxi, can be reckless next to the suicidal, this is \u2013 once again \u2013 especially true in the greater Managua area.\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\nBrazil\nBrazil has some reasonable cycling in some cities. Rio de Janeiro has a few good cycle paths and cycle hire. S\u00e3o Paulo has dedicated cycle ways, and nearby Guaruj\u00e1 has extensive cycle paths. Curitiba has over 100 km of cycle ways, one of the largest in the country. Overall, cycling is common, but traffic conditions don't make cycling as easy as it could be.\n\n\nColombia\nColombia is a particularly avid cycling nation, for the sport and the activity. Bogot\u00e1 has an extensive cycle network. Medellin regularly blocks major roads on Sundays for motorized traffic so joggers and cyclists and use them safely, a few shops set up along these roads and rent bicycles for cheap.\n\n\nEcuador\nEcuador is an excellent cycling destination, specially for mountain biking. There are multiple competitions and events organized almost every weekend. Quito, the nation's capital has a weekly event called Ciclopaseo in which every Sunday major roads are closed for motorized traffic. Cyclists, joggers, inline skaters and other athletes use it safely, and can enjoy the city. Along the roads you can find multiple shops where you can rent bicycles for cheap.\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nCars\nWhen biking along cars, especially where there are few bikers, it is essential that you are easily seen. Wear brightly coloured clothes. There are rear reflectors sticking out on the side of the traffic (left in most countries) to remind drivers to keep the distance. From dusk to dawn you should have good head and rear lights and reflectors also on the spokes and pedals.\n\n\nTheft\n\nBike thefts are common in many countries. Although locks cannot prevent theft entirely, they can discourage it. This is especially true if there are easier targets nearby, ideally posher than yours. A good lock is both hard to pick or decode, and hard to bypass with cutting tools or brute force. Fasten the lock in some stationary object when possible, and ideally through any quick release wheels as well. In some areas, bikes should not be left outdoors overnight.\nSome \"Smart Bikes\" have integral tracking devices and regular bikes can be fitted with aftermarket ones (e.g. the Apple AirTag). These depend on their own battery supply, data connection, and ability to remain inconspicuous after being stolen, and if any one of them fails, you'll be out your bike. Some are capable of sending alerts to your phone if they are being moved while locked, so if you are nearby you may have time to catch a thief in the act. Remember that your ability to get your stolen bike back is only as good as the desire of the local police to get it. Inside the European Union, unfortunately, there is not yet a cross-border tracking system for stolen bikes or their frame register numbers, even though the borders are largely open to the free flow of goods, capital, and people.\nMountain bikes and racing bikes typically have quick release valves, and other loose equipment, which make them easier to steal. If you use that kind of bike for urban cycling, it would be wise to refit it with traditional nuts and bolts, and to avoid making an expensive bike your daily driver.",
