  "extract": "Rio de Janeiro is a state in the Southeast of Brazil. It is a small coastal state wedged between S\u00e3o Paulo to the west, Esp\u00edrito Santo to the northeast, and Minas Gerais to the north. Rio de Janeiro is most famous for the sun, sand, and samba of its eponymous capital, but the state hosts a wide range of other environments, with quaint colonial villages, rugged mountain parks, lazy coastal towns, and hip beach resort destinations.\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n1 Rio de Janeiro\n2 Angra dos Reis - Beautiful two-hour coastline including 365 islands\n3 Maca\u00e9 - Brazil's booming oil capital.\n4 Niter\u00f3i - Just across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, go here to see Oscar Niemeyer's amazing Niteroi Museum of Contemporary Art (shaped like a UFO).\n5 Nova Igua\u00e7u - Famous for its violence and crime. This city has a myth of the only Brazilian volcano (scientifically not a volcano).\n6 Paraty - A 18th century well-preserved colonial town on the coast, just 260km West from Rio de Janeiro on the green coast\n7 Penedo - A Brazilian version of \"little Finland\" with euro architecture, cobblestone streets, small shops and lots of trout restaurants. Just outside of Resende.\n8 Petr\u00f3polis - A lovely city in the tops of the mountains.  A good place to cool off from the Rio sun!\n9 Teres\u00f3polis - A very nice city in the mountains close to Rio de Janeiro\n\n\nOther destinations\nAgulhas Negras - Mountain climbing at Itatiaia National Park\n1 Ilha Grande - Near Angra dos Reis, this island boasts some beautiful beaches.\n2 Serra da Bocaina National Park\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nGo next\nEsp\u00edrito Santo \u2014 Although somewhat off-the-beaten path, the state north of Rio de Janeiro has much to offer tourists. The capital Vit\u00f3ria's beautiful bay and bridge; Vila Velha's Convento da Penha (a 16th-century hilltop Franciscan convent); Guarapari's beaches and summer parties; the German-colonized town of Domingos Martins; Pedra Azul State Park's beautiful blue rock; and Ita\u00fanas's dunes and forr\u00f3 (a Northeastern Brazilian dance); are some of the main attractions that should guarantee tourists a good time.",
