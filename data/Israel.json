The modern State of Israel was established in 1948 as a homeland for the Jewish people, but the region contains thousands of years of history for many peoples and religions in addition to the Jews. Israel is considered part of the Holy Land (together with areas of Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian territories), and of the Levant and in ancient history of the Fertile Crescent. The three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, as well as the Baha'i Faith, have strong ties to this land, and their holy and historic sites are major destinations for pilgrims and tourists from around the world. The Israeli population is about 74% Jews, 21% Arabs, and 5% non-Arab Christians and others. Most of the Jews are descended from Olim (\"returnees\" from the Jewish Diaspora), and their diverse origins (Russian, German, Moroccan, Yemeni, and Ethiopian, to name a few of the prominent ones) can be seen in various aspects of modern Israeli culture.\nIn contrast to its long ancient history, Israel is a highly urbanized, economically developed, first-world society. It remains in conflict with the Palestinians and some of its other Arab neighbors. \nSince 1967, Israel has controlled most of the West Bank (often called \"Judea and Samaria\" in Israel) as well as the Golan Heights. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan, but most other countries, except the United States, reject the annexation, and consider these areas and the West Bank (which Israel did not annex, and Israeli law does not apply to the area) to be occupied Arab territories. Wikivoyage takes no stance on these political issues, but notes that in practice, current visitors to these areas will need Israeli visas and permits.\n\n\nRegions\nIsrael possesses a number of diverse regions, with landscapes varying between coast, mountain, forest, and desert, with just about everything in between. On a single winter day, for example, you could go skiing at the Hermon mountain on the Golan Heights, and then sunbathe next to the Dead Sea. The metropolitan areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv form very much their own regions; from north to south, however, Israel's regions are as follows:\n\n\nDisputed territories\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Jerusalem \u2013 the capital and largest city of Israel; a diverse city sacred for millennia to the three Abrahamic religions (Jews, Christians and Muslims). It has an abundance of historic sites from five millennia.\n2 Tel Aviv \u2013 the center of Israel's economy and modern culture, this vibrant city is known as the \"White City\" for its Bauhaus architecture. It is home to beautiful historic architecture in its Old Jaffa district, and towering skyscrapers, sandy beaches, bustling markets, a vibrant LGBT scene and the largest nightclub scene of the Middle East.\n3 Akko (Acre) \u2013 an ancient town with a historic port and the most sacred Baha'i site. Its coastal old town is particularly beautiful\n4 Be'er Sheva \u2013 the de facto capital of the Negev region\n5 Eilat \u2013 the 'Goa of the Middle East', Israel's window on the Red Sea, a vibrant resort city\n6 Haifa \u2013 the largest city in northern Israel, this city possesses beautiful seaside views from its peak on Mount Carmel, as well as a rich heritage as a major port city. The city is home to historic Ottoman and Mediterranean-style architecture, with red rooftops, cobbled streets and palm trees. It is home to the ornate Baha'i World Center (a  UNESCO World Heritage Site), and its picturesque gardens, which are considered the city\u2019s major attraction.\n7 Nazareth \u2013 the hometown of Jesus, now the largest Arab city in Israel\n8 Safed (Tzfat) \u2013 a fascinating mountaintop city filled with artists and mystics, home to ARI school of Kabbalah\n9 Tiberias \u2013 a modern resort town with an ancient background, on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Old City of Jerusalem \u2013 a historic walled area within the modern city of Jerusalem split into four quarters: the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian. Tourists of different religions and nations come from around the world to visit its holy sites, which include the Dome of the Rock, the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A UNESCO World Heritage site.\n2 Old City of Acre \u2013 One of the oldest port cities in the world, a UNESCO World Heritage site\n3 Sea of Galilee region \u2013 the home of Jesus of Nazareth and the largest freshwater lake in the country\n4 Dead Sea \u2013 a sea of hypersalinated water that keeps people afloat and the lowest point on Earth\n5 Jezreel Valley \u2013 an extensive inland valley, largely rural, extending inland from east of Haifa to the Jordan Valley\n6 Judaean Desert \u2013 an arid landscape with an array of hills, canyons, and hidden historic sites\n7 Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Gardens and World Center \u2013 center of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, home to the Shrine of the B\u00e1b and Terraces, in the northern city of Haifa\n\n\nProminent national parks\n8 Masada \u2013 high on a plateau above the Dead Sea, the scene of the Zealots' last stand against the might of Rome. A UNESCO World Heritage site.\n9 Ein Avdat \u2013 beautiful steep canyon and a popular hiking spot\n10 Caesarea National Park  \u2013 an ancient Roman and Crusader city with well-preserved remains\n11 Beth Shean Valley \u2013 the core of the north Jordan River valley\n12 Belvoir Fortress \u2013 a Crusader fortress on a ridge in the eastern edge of the Galilee.\n13 Nimrod Fortress \u2013 remains of a medieval fortress in the northern Golan Heights, 800 meters above sea level.\n14 Rosh Haniqra \u2013 spectacular caverns on Israel's Mediterranean coast in the Western Galilee in the north of Israel, near the northern border with Lebanon.\n\n\nProminent nature reserves\n15 Ramon Crater \u2013 40 km long crater-like landform in the middle of the Negev desert, the largest of three similar craters found in Israel. Offers breathtaking desert vistas.\n16 Mount Hermon \u2013 The mountain is partly in Israel and partly  in Syria and Lebanon. The Israeli summit of the mountain is 2,224m above sea level and is the highest location in the country. The total area of the Hermon nature reserve is 76,250 hectares. Most of the nature reserve is in a restricted military area (except for Hermon Ski resort and the Banias springs area at the slopes of the mountain which are popular visited destination).\n17 Carmel Range \u2013 a forested hilly region along the Mediterranean coast, southeast of Haifa\nSee also #Do for parks and reserves.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nUntil the Middle Ages\n\nWhile the current state of Israel is a relatively new country founded in 1948, the \"land of Israel\" has a long, complex history stretching back thousands of years to the beginnings of human civilization. It's been invaded by virtually every Old World empire including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Crusaders, Mongols, Ottomans, French (with Napoleon as general), and British. It is the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, and also contains sacred sites of Islam and the Baha'i Faith.\n\nIsrael has been inhabited for tens of thousands of years, with Neanderthal remains from the region dating back 50,000 years. Its strategic location serving as a land bridge from Asia to Egypt and the rest of Africa made Israel an ideal target for conquerors through the ages. The first nation to conquer the land was Egypt, in the 16th century BC. In the Fifth Year of Pharaoh Merenptah (roughly 1208 BC) Israel is mentioned on a stele as having been \"laid waste\" (likely a propaganda exaggeration), which constitutes the first mention of Israel known to history. Incidentally that same year is also the date of an inscription on behalf of the same Pharaoh mentioning the \"Sea Peoples\" who are often blamed for the virtual collapse of urban and writing society in the eastern Mediterranean of the time, ushering in - among other things - the \"Greek Dark Ages\" and the collapse of the Hittite Empire. In approximately 1000 BC, an Israelite kingdom was set up under King Saul. According to the Biblical account, King Saul was succeeded by kings David and Solomon, but after Solomon's death the kingdom split in two (though many historians contend that the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were never united but instead were always rival kingdoms). The northern kingdom was conquered by Assyria in 722 BC, and the southern kingdom by Babylonia in 586 BC. Both conquests were accompanied by an exile of the Israelites from their land.\nSeveral decades later, the Persian empire conquered Babylonia, and allowed the Jewish exiles to return and reestablish a province centered around Jerusalem. The Persian empire was in turn conquered in ~330 BC by Alexander the Great. In ~166 BC, the Maccabees rebelled against the Seleucid Greeks and established an independent Jewish state, but this state was conquered in 63 BC by the Roman Empire. Around 30 CE, Jesus of Nazareth began his ministry in the Galilee.\nPeriodic Jewish revolts against the Romans had some temporary success, but eventually led to destruction and exile for the Jews. The Roman/Byzantine Empire continued to rule the area until the 7th century, when the area was conquered (very briefly) by the Persians, and then by the Muslim Arabs. In the Crusades (11th-13th centuries), Christians were temporarily able to conquer the Holy Land from the Muslims. After 1290, when the Crusaders were expelled by Saladin, the land was ruled by different Muslim rulers. The last of those Muslim rulers was Ottoman Turkey, which was defeated in the First World War. After the war, the area that is now Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan became the \"League of Nations Mandate for Palestine\", intended in part as a homeland for Jewish people.\n\n\nSince World War I\nSee also: Holocaust remembrance\nDuring the 1920s, the British were handed a mandate to prepare the region for a future Jewish state. Arab pressure led to the eastern part of the mandate being split off into the Arab kingdom of Transjordan (now Jordan) and declared off-limits for Jews.\nThe first two major waves of modern Jewish immigration were in 1882 and the early 1900s, under Ottoman rule, followed by refugees from Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. Before 1948, immigration was almost exclusively by Ashkenazi Jews, who spoke mostly Yiddish and/or the national languages of their countries of residence. Initially, religious Jews were largely opposed to the idea of Zionism, and as such the first waves of immigrants were dominated by idealistic but secular Jews.\nWhile several Arab leaders and individuals welcomed Jewish immigration to develop the largely agricultural land, starting in the 1920s the Arab majority was vocally hostile to Zionism. Both Zionist and non-Zionist Jews were attacked during the riots of 1929 and the later Arab revolt of 1936-1939. During World War II, Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, openly allied with Nazi Germany and called for an Arab state with no Jews in it. The Jewish population formed several armed groups to defend themselves \u2013 the Haganah (precursor to the modern Israeli army) was the largest and most important, but there were also more violent and extremist offshoots like the Irgun. In 1939 the British decided to appease Arab radicals with the \"White Paper\", which severely limited Jewish immigration just as the Nazis were about to begin World War II. This was bitterly opposed by Zionists. When the British continued to prevent the immigration of Holocaust survivors after the war, Jewish underground groups became heavily involved in illegal immigration, and the more radical groups conducted violent attacks on the British government.\nAfter two years of growing violence between Jews, Arabs, and the British government, in the fall of 1947 the British decided to withdraw from the area. The UN recommended that the territory of Palestine be partitioned into separate Jewish and Arab states, which was agreed to by both the United States and the Soviet Union. The Jews accepted the plan, but the Arabs firmly rejected it. Nonetheless, on 14 May 1948, the Jews declared independence as the State of Israel. The Arabs responded with a military invasion. The Israelis won a decisive victory. As a result of the war, approximately 600,000 Arabs were displaced from the territory of the newly-proclaimed Jewish state. This event is known as the Nakba (lit. catastrophe) to Palestinians, and to Israelis as their War of Independence. A comparable number of Jews were displaced from Arab nations in the late 1940s and 1950s, and many of them settled in Israel.\nAt first, France was Israel's most important ally and arms supplier, though Czechoslovakia had also been an important supplier of weapons up till 1949. Israel would participate in the Suez Crisis on the side of France and the United Kingdom in 1956, during which it would gain control of the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. However, under American and Soviet pressure, Israel would be forced to withdraw from Sinai in 1957, though the agreement would also guarantee Israeli ships free passage through the Straits of Tiran. Further fighting continued over the next few decades, and in the Six-Day War of 1967 the Israelis won another decisive victory against the Arabs, during which it regained control of Sinai from Egypt, and also gained control of the Golan Heights from Syria. Despite urgent pleas by Israel asking Jordan not to attack (Israel had enjoyed a less belligerent relationship with Jordan than other Arab neighbors), King Hussein was ultimately convinced by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser to do so. The Jordanian attack led to Israel quickly capturing East Jerusalem and the West Bank, leading to the ongoing and controversial situation in both places.\nIn 1973, Anwar Sadat, who had succeeded the deceased Nasser as leader of Egypt, decided to launch a surprise attack on Israel during Yom Kippur, one of the highest holidays in Judaism. While the Israeli secret service had hints of an impending attack, Prime Minister Golda Meir decided not to launch a pre-emptive strike for fear of a negative reaction by other countries, particularly the U.S. Despite early gains by the Arab side, Israel ultimately gained the upper hand, aided by U.S. arms shipments which helped cement what is seen today as one of both countries' strongest and longest-lasting alliances. In 1979, a peace treaty was concluded between Israel and Egypt (with Sinai returned to Egypt) with American mediation, and in 1994, a similar peace treaty was signed with Jordan again with American mediation. Both agreements have held to this day. However, a peace process with Palestinian Arabs that began in the early 1990s failed in 2000, and little progress has been seen since then. In the 21st century, other actors than the U.S. have tried to mediate in the conflict, but neither the EU nor the Arab League have had more luck than U.S. mediation. Israel normalized relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 2020 with U.S. mediation, making them the first Gulf states to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. In the same year, Israel also normalized relations with Sudan with U.S. mediation - the first peace deal with a country that had actually fought a war with Israel since the Jordan peace deal. In December 2020, Morocco became the sixth Arab nation, and second North African nation to normalise ties with Israel.\nIsrael remains officially at war with neighboring Syria and Lebanon, and has similar hostilities with the Hamas organization which controls the Gaza Strip. However, these borders are usually quiet \u2013 infrequently shells or rockets will be fired across them, and on rare occasions a full-scale conflict will break out (for example, in 2014 and 2023\u20132024). There are also occasional cases of individual violent attacks between Israelis and West Bank Palestinians, who have significant interaction in the West Bank and Jerusalem.\nAlthough it's in Asia, due to hostility from the Arab countries, Israel participates in European rather than Asian regional bodies.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nIsrael has a technologically advanced market economy with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial sectors since the 1980s. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, aircraft, high-tech defense systems, chemicals and chemical products, machinery and equipment, transport equipment, rubber, plastics, textiles and services in various fields are the leading exports. Large reserves of offshore natural gas have been discovered since 2009.\nFor many years Israel posted sizable current account deficits, which were covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. However, tight fiscal policy and high growth rates led Israel to a budget surplus. Roughly half of the government's foreign debt is owed to the U.S., which is its major source of economic and military aid.\nIsrael's economy grew rapidly in the 1990s due to immigration from the former USSR, the opening of new markets at the end of the Cold War, the optimism of the peace process, and the dot-com boom. However, in 2000 the combination of a second intifada and the dot-com bust led to a severe recession. Since 2004 the economy has resumed growing, and Israel was one of the world's most resilient economies during the 2008 \"Great Recession\". From the 2010s, Israel\u2019s economy has grown rapidly, largely due to the country\u2019s high-tech industries. Today, Israel is a developed country and in 2022 has a GDP per capita similar to the European Union average. The cost of living \u2013 especially in big cities like Tel Aviv \u2013 is surprisingly high and there is a long-standing debate about the problem of economic emigration.\n\n\nSociety\nThe most obvious division in Israel's society is between Jews \u2013 who make up 75% of the population in Israel proper and 15%\u201340% in areas captured by Israel during the Six-Day War (West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights) \u2013 and non-Jews (mostly Arab Palestinian citizens of Israeli), who make up nearly all of the rest. In addition, some 350,000 people who emigrated to Israel from the former Soviet Union are not considered Jews according to the standards of halakha (Jewish law), though most have some Jewish ancestry and they largely identify with the Jewish mainstream. In terms of religious affiliation, 77% of Israelis are Jewish, 16% are Muslim, 4% are Christian Arabs, and 2% are Druze (a Muslim offshoot considered heretical by mainstream Islam).\nThere are also deep divisions within Jewish society. First is the cultural division between the 'Ashkenazim', whose ancestors came from communities that developed over hundreds of years in Central and Eastern Europe, who dominated statebuilding in Israel's first decades as a state, and were traditionally considered wealthier and better connected politically (particularly those from Germany and other central or northern European countries), and the 'Sephardim' and 'Mizrahim', who immigrated from the Balkans, Middle East, Yemen and North Africa. Sephardi and Mizrahi immigrants from Europe tend to match the socioeconomic profile of Ashkenazim. However, the divide between these ethnic groups has greatly narrowed, and intermarriage has become common. Massive immigration of Ethiopian Jews in the 1980s and Russian-speaking Jews in the 1990s has added additional notable demographics to Israel's population. Despite the majority of the world's Jews being Ashkenazim and despite Zionism initially being largely an Ashkenazi phenomenon, these days there are more Mizrahim/Sephardim in Israel than Ashkenazim, and Mizrahi/Sephardi culture is by far culturally dominant in today\u2019s Israel. Further, marriage between Jewish ethnic groups has increased year-over-year in Israel, and a plurality of Israeli Jews today are of mixed Jewish backgrounds (for example, it's common for someone to be descended from Polish Jews on one side of their family, and Tunisian Jews on the other).\nWhile ethnic divisions have weakened as the native-born population has increased, religious tensions between 'secular' and 'Orthodox' Jews have increased. The spectrum ranges from the stringently Orthodox 'Haredim' (who form only 9% of the population but wield a disproportionate amount of power, thanks to Israel's fractious coalition politics), to 10% who are 'religious' (similar to 'Modern Orthodox' outside Israel), 15% 'traditional-religious', 23% 'traditional', and 43% 'secular'. While secular and traditional Jews are widespread throughout all of Israel, Orthodox Jews tend to be concentrated in some cities, such as Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, and Ashdod, while Tel Aviv is known for being one of the most socially liberal cities in the world, on par with major American and Western European cities. Despite the common perception of religious Jews being more ardent Zionists and secular Jews being more open to \"land for peace\" deals with the Palestinians, Ultra-Orthodox Jews (a term rejected as pejorative by many) are actually largely opposed to the current Israeli state and some consider Zionism blasphemous as they believe that only the Messiah can restore Israeli statehood. On the other hand, large groups of Russian-speaking or Mizrachi Jews are relatively secular but vote for parties generally considered to fall into the \"hawkish\" camp and are opposed to the principle of \"land for peace\" and highly skeptical of negotiations with Hamas, Fatah or those neighbors with whom Israel does not maintain official diplomatic relations.\nJewish travellers from the English-speaking world may affiliate with non-Orthodox Jewish religious movements such as Reform/Liberal, Reconstructionist, and Masorti/Conservative. However, travellers should be aware that while these movements do have a presence in Israel, they are dwarfed by secular Jews and the Orthodox; institutional support for organized non-Orthodox religious life is minimal.\nIn any case, if a traveller wishes to (e.g.) attend Shabbat services at a synagogue or at a family\u2019s house, they should do advance planning and research, or at least join a local contact person to help with the little details (where to sit, when to come, what\u2019s expected etc).\n\n\nHolidays\n\n\nShabbat\nIn Israel, the workweek is from Sunday to Thursday. Friday is a day when most Israelis don't work, and the street and the markets in the Jewish cities during Friday will be crowded than usual. On Friday, shops, markets, and Kosher restaurants close between 14:00 and 16:00, and public transportation (except East Jerusalem and Nazareth) usually ends on Fridays around 16:00 and restarts on Saturday around 18:00 in the winter or 21:00 in the summer. This is because of Shabbat (the sabbath), which begins Friday afternoon around sunset, and ends Saturday around sunset, though many places do not reopen/renew service until Sunday morning. The same holds true for major Jewish or national holidays. This is critical if you rely on the bus or train to explore the country or go to/from the airport (planes do fly on Shabbat, except for El Al airline). So plan your itinerary accordingly. Sherut (shared minibus taxis) will often operate on Shabbat, and can be used for intercity travel if you must travel between Friday evening and Saturday evening.\n\n\nPublic holidays\nDifferent levels of activity stop in Israel depending on the festival or holiday, and different areas will see different levels of activity on these days. Public transportation usually stops completely on most holidays. Holidays in Israel follow the Jewish calendar, which means that the Gregorian date will vary from year to year although tending to fall within the same 6-week period. In the Jewish tradition, a new day begins at sunset, meaning that Jewish holidays begin on the eve of the official date (not at midnight). A list of Gregorian dates matched with the National holidays and Jewish holidays can be found at the holidays section of the \"GoIsrael\" site or at Hebcal. A more elaborate list of Jewish holidays and dates can be found at the Jewish holidays section of the Chabad site, although some of the holidays mentioned there are scarcely celebrated or have no influence on day-to-day activities.\nHolidays on which stores and public transportation are closed (similar to Shabbat) are marked with a plus sign (+):\n\n+  Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year). falls between 5 September and 5 October. It is two days long.   \n+  Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). falls between 14 September and 14 October. The holiest day in the Jewish Calendar on which EVERYTHING comes to a halt: all businesses, banking, shopping, entertainment, restaurants, public and private traffic, etc. Children on bicycles, rollerblades, and skateboards flood the streets of secular towns. Emergency vehicles have limited mobility. Do not drive a car in Jewish areas on Yom Kippur - you are likely to run over kids who are playing in the street.   (updated Oct 2019)\n+  Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles/Booths). falls between 19 September and 19 October, and lasts 7 days. Only the first day is a national holiday with stores and public transportation closed, but some disruption occurs during the other days.   \n+  Shemini Atzeret (Simchat Torah). falls between 26 September and 26 October; it is effectively the 8th day of Sukkot. Street festivals and dancing are common in most cities and towns on the preceding evening.   \n Yitzhak Rabin's Remembrance Day (Yom Hazikaron le Yitzhak Rabin). falls between 25 October and 9 November. It is a memorial day. Also, on the Saturday adjacent to 4 November a memorial rally is held on Rabin square in Tel Aviv, and other locations.   \n Hanukkah. falls between 27 November and 27 December, and lasts 8 days. It is celebrated by lighting candles and eating jelly doughnuts, sufganiot.   \n Purim. falls between 24 February and 26 March (outside Jerusalem). Children and adults dress in costumes and street parades are common on this day. In Jerusalem, Purim is celebrated one day later than in the rest of Israel and is officially known as Shushan Purim.   \n+  Pesach (Passover). is seven days long; the first day falls between 26 March and 25 April. (Only the first and last days are national holidays with stores and public transportation closed, however there may be some disruption during the intermediate days.) No leavened bread or grain products are sold or served in most places during this week (including beer and some alcohols). On the evening after Passover ends, the custom of \"Mimouna\" is celebrated, involving hospitality and traditional home-made cuisine.   \n Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day; Yom HaZikaron LaShoah VeLaGevurah). falls between 7 April and 7 May. A memorial sirens sound at 10:00; the entire country observes 2 minutes of silence in memory of victims of the Holocaust. Restaurants and entertainment establishments are closed on this day and its eve.   \n Yom HaZikaron (Fallen Soldiers Remembrance Day; Yom HaZikaron LeHalaley Ma'archot Israel VeLenifga'ey Pe'ulot Ha'eiva). falls between 14 April and 14 May. A memorial sirens sound on the eve (20:00) and in the morning (11:00); the entire country observes a silence in memory of its fallen soldiers and terror attack victims.   \n+  Yom Ha-Atzmaut (Independence Day). falls between 15 April and 15 May. Large street festivals, city-wide parties and fireworks displays are held on the eve. The day is usually celebrated by sightseeing and picnicking. Yom Ha-Atzmaut always falls the day after Yom HaZikaron, and as the Jewish day traditionally begins and ends at sundown, the transition from sorrow to celebration on streets all around Israel as night falls is truly something special.   \n Lag Ba'Omer (33rd day of the 'Omer'). bonfires are common on the eve.   \n Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day). parades and festivals occur in Jerusalem.   \n+  Shavuot (Pentecost). falls between 15 May and 14 June   \n Tisha B'Av (9th of Av fast). commemorates the destruction of the First and Second Temples.   \n\n\nElectricity\n\nThe voltage in Israel is 230 V, and the frequency is 50 Hz. The electric outlets used are type H and rarely Type C. Type H is a three-pronged standard unique to Israel, but most modern type H outlets can also accept type C European two-pronged plugs. In fact, most electronic devices in Israel use type C plugs. For more information on plug types, please see our Electrical systems article.\n\n\nClimate\nSummer in Israel is uncomfortably hot; the coastal areas are hot and humid, and areas to the east are hot and dry. The other three seasons, in contrast, have absolutely beautiful weather and are ideal for travel. In spring and autumn the temperatures are comfortable and nearly all days are sunny. Winter is mild with a mixture of cold, rainy days and cool, sunny days which are great for hiking and touring.\nEspecially during summer, it is important to protect yourself from the sun and drink plenty of water. Also, hilly inland areas in Israel (particularly Jerusalem and the north) occasionally experience snowfall in the winter, sometimes heavy enough to disrupt transportation.\n\n\nVisitor information\nGo Israel tourism information\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Hebrew phrasebook, Arabic phrasebook\n\nHebrew is the official language of Israel, while at least 20% of the population speak Arabic as well. Israelis share much pride in the Hebrew language, and learning the language is considered necessary to fully integrate into Israeli society. Until 2018, Arabic was a co-official language. While speaking Hebrew slang, words of Arabic origin are commonly used. For example: \"Walla?\" (Is that so?), \"Yalla!\" (Come on, let\u2019s move!), \"Sababa\" (great, fine, okay, or signals agreement or acknowledgment), \"Akhla\" (good), \u201cAhlan\u201d (hello), \"Sachbak\" (friend who takes care of me), and many more. Street talk is also much affected by military jargon, which is second nature to many Israelis. \nArabic, the main language of the region as well as the first language of the many Arabs who live in Israel, is spoken by 20% of the population. Israeli Jews also learn Arabic in school (mainly Modern Standard Arabic, MSA). Palestinian Arabic is the main dialect spoken by Israeli Arabs.\nEnglish is the most popular foreign language, and Israelis study it in school from an early age. Nearly anyone you meet on the street will be able to communicate with you in English. The main exception is Hasidic Jews (\u201cHaredim\u201d), who rarely study English, and instead speak Yiddish. Also, English proficiency can vary wildly. All street and road signs (and many others) have English, as well as the Hebrew and Arabic names.\nMass immigration from the former Soviet Union since the 1990s brought a large number of immigrants who speak Russian, and it is the most widely spoken non-official language in Israel. \nOther encountered languages in Israel, reflecting the diverse origins of Israelis, include Persian, Turkish, Romanian, French, German, Polish, Amharic, Marathi, Malayalam and Spanish, though with the exception of French and Amharic among first-generation immigrants, these languages have become rare to encounter in Israel. Some of the older members of the population and most Chasidic Jews speak Yiddish, a Central/Eastern-European Germanic Jewish language. Foreign workers from China, the Philippines, Thailand, and other Asian countries can be seen everywhere in central Israel. You can hear a mix of a dozen languages while on buses, trains or walking in transportation hubs, especially in the Tel Aviv central bus station.\n\n\nGet in\nIf you are Jewish and aged 18 to 26, you are entitled to a free 10-day all expenses paid trip to Israel run by Birthright Israel. As part of this trip, you will be taken to the various Jewish holy sites around Israel, and also get a chance to interact with soldiers of the Israeli military.\n\n\nEntry requirements\nSee also: Visa trouble\n\nAll foreign nationals entering Israel must have a visa or an electronic travel authorization (ETA-IL). Electronic travel authorization is available to citizens of certain countries and allows to visit Israel for tourism for up to 90 days. Travelers can check eligibility and apply for an ETA on the official website, the cost is \u20aa25 (waived during pilot period).\nBefore January 2025, having an ETA is optional.\nCitizens of the following countries/territories are eligible for an ETA (official list here): all European Union member states, Albania, Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eswatini, Fiji, Georgia, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Jamaica, Japan, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Macau, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Suriname, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay and Vanuatu.\nIf, however, you are suspected of illegal activities, being of Arab descent, Muslim, or a political activist, there is a possibility of you being subject to additional questioning, searches and/or denied entry, if they are not satisfied after questioning, according to the US Department of State. Holding citizenship in one of the above listed countries does not guarantee entry. Decisions are left to the discretion of immigration officers.\nA visa or residence permit will not be granted to you, if you, or the organization you're part of, have knowingly issued a public call to boycott the state of Israel or pledged to take part in such a boycott.\nGerman citizens born before 1 Jan 1928 do have to apply for a visa in advance. This visa will be given if you were not heavily involved in persecution during the Nazi era and will be valid for the whole time your passport is valid.\nEgyptian citizens do not need a visa for stays of up to 14 days if entering through Taba and visiting up to Beer Sheva only.\n\nFor some Arab states it constitutes a crime for their citizens to enter Israel at all. Even if you're an Arab-born citizen of a European or North American country, having entered Israel may have consequences when going to your (other) country of citizenship.\nIsraeli Customs and Immigration officers may take a dim view of travelers arriving from Arab countries, but you are unlikely to face anything worse than very time-consuming and repetitive but polite questioning. Depending on the situation, if you have stamps from other Arab countries in your passport, you should expect to be taken to one side (without any explanation) and eventually questioned. This can take anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours. The key thing to remember is this: if you have nothing to hide, then, other than the inconvenience of questioning, you should have nothing to be worried about. If you are a young backpacker, especially if you travel alone, it is much more likely you will be detained for questioning in Ben Gurion Airport. There is a \"selection committee\" of 2 security guards waiting when you go up the escalators from your flight, and if you seem suspicious they will not hesitate to stop you. If you dress up nicely or seem a part of another group or a family they are less likely to bother you.\nIf you're in Israel on a tourist visa (B2) and decide to renew your visa for a longer term, you may do so at the Ministry of the Interior Visa office for a small fee. Just call Ministry of Interior Call center at \u260f +972 2 629-4666 to find out where is the office near you. Alternately, citizens from most European and North American countries can renew their visas by crossing into Jordan and back at the Arava border crossing near Eilat or by crossing into Egypt and back at Taba.\n\n\nBy plane\nAs of October 2024, there is only one international airport.  \n\n1 Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV IATA). Israel's main international airport. Located on the outskirts of Lod, it is about 20 km (12 mi) southeast of Tel Aviv and about 45 km (28 mi) northwest of Jerusalem. The airport is of extreme strategic importance because it is one of the few convenient entry points to the country. It is the main hub of Israeli flag carrier El Al.   (updated Jul 2022)\n2 Ramon Airport (Ilan & Assaf Ramon Airport, ETM IATA) (On Hwy 90, 20 km north of Eilat). This domestic-only airport opened in 2019, and now handles all flights to Eilat, plus it acts as the diversion airport for Ben Gurion.   (updated Oct 2024)\n3 Haifa Airport (HFA IATA), \u260f +972 3-975-8303. Flights to Eilat and Lanarca are scheduled to commence in late 2024.   (updated Oct 2024)\nFlights to Israel are subject to extra security measures at their points of departure. This means that you will be subject to intense questioning at check-in, and pass through an additional security screening at the boarding gate.\n\n\nBy boat\nIt is surprisingly difficult for the individual traveler to reach Israel by boat, and there are no regular ferries. Lots of large cruise ships call at Haifa and Ashdod but these are not available for point-to-point trips. Salamis Cruises very occasionally runs short cruises from Limassol in Cyprus to Haifa (and, if you prefer, to Beirut), and conversely, the Haifa-based line Mano operates short cruises round the Mediterranean. These may be available as point-to-point trips but you would probably have to pay the full cruise fare, carry only light luggage as landing is by small tenders, and make other arrangements for return as there might not be another such cruise till the following summer. With your own yacht or other small craft, from abroad you may land in Israel at Haifa, Herzliya, Tel Aviv or Ashkelon. Call ahead before entering Israeli waters to arrange immigration and customs clearance. Eilat does not specifically list marina arrival facilities, but it is of course a 24-hour commercial port of entry.\nSee also Ferries in the Mediterranean and Freighter travel.\n\n\nBy road\nThere are land routes from Egypt and Jordan to Israel; these border crossings have security measures similar to the airports. There are no land routes to either Syria or Lebanon, owing to the fact that these countries do not officially recognize Israel's existence.\n\nJordan has three crossings with Israel: the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge (the shortest way between Amman and Jerusalem, the busiest crossing); the Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein Bridge (in the north); and Arava/Yitshak Rabin (2 km from Eilat). It's fairly straightforward to cross using a series of buses, though pay attention to the childish Aqaba border taxi Mafia. If you cross the King Hussein Bridge you will not be given an exit stamp for Jordan, and you will not be stamped on re-entry if you choose to return. Mentioning West Bank destinations in your itinerary will arise suspicion \u2013 it is just best to avoid mentioning the Palestinian Territories at all while passing the border.\nFrom Egypt you can cross the border at the Taba Border Terminal, near Eilat. From the terminal to Eilat, take bus number 16, 30, or a taxi. The terminal is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with the exception of the Jewish Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) and the Muslim Eid al-Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice).\nIsraeli rental cars are not generally permitted across the borders for insurance reasons; in addition, it may not be advisable to travel in Arab countries while displaying an Israeli number plate.\nTravelers leaving Israel by land will need to pay an exit fee at the border. (No fee needs to be paid at the airport \u2013 it may be included in the ticket cost.) As of 2021, the fee is \u20aa176 for Allenby Bridge, and \u20aa101 for all other border terminals.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n\nFrom Amman\nThere are weekly buses to Nazareth via the Sheikh Hussein bridge (near Beit Shean), call the operator (+972 4 657-3984) for details. From Nazareth there are buses to Haifa, Tel Aviv, and other destinations.\nAlternatively, you can take a bus to the Sheikh Hussein bridge, cross the border on foot, and get to Israeli destinations by taxi/bus.\nIf you don't have Israeli citizenship, you can also use the King Hussein border crossing near Jericho\u2014see link for more details.\n\n\nFrom Cairo\nThere are twice-weekly buses to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem (USD90 one way) via Eilat, operated by Mazada tours (Tel +972 2 623-5777). You still have to change buses at the border. (Use Mazada tours at your own risk! They subcontract the Egyptian side of the journey and do little to nothing to help if there is any mix up. At least one Mazada group from Tel Aviv/Jerusalem reportedly was held at the Taba Border - Egyptian side for 7 hours because the Israeli company failed to pay the Egyptian company.)\nAlternatively, you can take a bus to Taba, then cross the border to Eilat on foot.\n\n\nGet around\nSee also: Public transit in Israel\nIsrael generally has a modern, sophisticated travel network, although public transit service is not as good as in Europe or East Asia. It is safe and easy to get around the country, although it can be slow (due to traffic, or slow or infrequent buses). Israelis are always willing to help a lost tourist, so never be afraid to ask people for directions or advice.\nTravelers should also be aware of Shabbat (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea) the Hebrew word often spelled \"Sabbath\" in English. From Friday at 16:00 until Saturday at 18:00 (November to March) or 21:00 (April to October), With the exception of Nazareth, Haifa, East Jerusalem and Eilat, public transport services are completely stopped. Included to Tel Aviv airport. In Tel Aviv during the Shabat the municipality operates shuttles with a frequency of every 20 minutes, information about which is available at the bus stations, and in the Google Maps and moovit applications. There will be limited taxi service, and a weekend surcharge applies. \nPublic transport is used heavily by soldiers traveling to/from their bases, so a bus or train packed full of soldiers (some armed) is a common occasion and does not indicate any special occurrence. There is a particularly large number of soldiers mainly in the intercity transport on Thursday afternoon and on Sunday morning.\nThe official national call center for public transportation information (available in English as well) is on *8787 or 072-2588787 (for phone with no access to *star numbers). There is no fee except for regular call-charge. Public transit planning mobile apps are helpful, see Public transit in Israel #By Internet and smartphone.\nJerusalem has a single light rail line with more planned and under construction, while Tel Aviv has a light rail system under construction. The oldest subway in the Middle East is \"Carmelit\" in Haifa, which is worth taking for the novelty, but of limited use otherwise, as it only serves one rather short line.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses are the most common form of public transportation for Israelis and travelers alike. Bus travel is the cheapest way to get around Israel, and is safe and reliable. Israeli soldiers travel for free on most public bus routes, so travelers will often see armed soldiers on buses. The largest bus company in Israel  is Egged  (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3), which was formed in 1933. Egged operates 30% of the country's public transportation service lines.\nIntercity buses typically begin and end their routes at central bus stations, and also pick up and drop off passengers along the route. Buses do not have toilets on them, But on journeys lasting more than three hours, the driver stops to refreshing for about 15 minutes at a gas station. Except of the buses to Eilat, there is no need and it is not possible to purchase tickets in advance.\nThe signage at the bus stops and buses in languages other than Hebrew is limited. Ask people around you for help or use mobile apps. If you are unsure where to get off the bus, sit near the front and ask the bus driver to help you. Most drivers are willing to help, as are most passengers.\nGoogle Maps or Moovit apps offer directions for travel in Israel based on bus schedules.\n\n\nBy Sherut\n\nA sherut (Hebrew for service) or servees (Arabic) is a shared taxi that seats more than four people (the usual capacity is ten). Depending on the circumstances, a driver will follow a predetermined route like a bus, or will transport a group of people from one location to another based on demand. A sherut can be hailed from anywhere, but can be easily found outside major bus stations. They are usually quicker than buses, and will usually stop at any point along the route (not just predetermined stations). Prices vary depending on the length of the trip and are not negotiable. Drivers may wait until their vehicle is full before beginning their journey. Most Sherut lines do not operate during Shabbat and holidays, with few exception depending on the location and popularity. \nThis form of transportation is best when traveling from a large bus station to a surrounding town or suburb, with a precise destination in mind.\n\n\nBy train\n\nTrains are generally quicker and more comfortable than buses. Except in the Galilee, the Dead Sea and the Negev Desert. Israel's train network reaches most of the main cities as well as Ben Gurion Airport, the main entry point for foreign visitors. The main destinations reached by the train are Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Be'er Sheva, Acre and Beit Shean. Unlike the train stations in Europe, the train stations are usually not within walking distance of the urban attractions and require the use of an additional means of transportation.\nTrains run 2-3 times per hour in peak travel times and at least once an hour at off peak hours. Trains on the Nahariya-Haifa-Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion Airport-Be'er Sheva line run through the night too. However, after midnight, trains stop in Haifa at the Hof Hacarmel station only, in Tel Aviv at Merkaz (Central) only, and in Be'er Sheva at Merkaz (Central) only. All other Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv and Haifa stations close after midnight. One must also remember that trains operate only on weekdays (there are no trains from Friday afternoon till Saturday evening). In fact, the trains stop several hours earlier on Friday than buses do. The Tel Aviv-Jerusalem line via Ben Gurion Airport is the first electrified line in the country and trains reach up to 160 km/h (99 mph). You'll find a lot of double decker trains reminiscent of those found in Germany and IC3 multiple units like those found in Denmark. Most of the rolling stock has been bought in the 21st century and is therefore modern and comfortable.\n\nIsrael Railways runs intercity lines from Nahariya to Be'er Sheva via Haifa, Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion airport, from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, and suburban lines radiating from Tel Aviv to Binyamina, Ashkelon, Kfar Sava, Raanana, Rishon LeZion, Modiin and Bet Shemesh. There is also a suburban line between Be'er Sheva and Dimona.\nTel Aviv has 4 train stations, Haifa (including its eastern suburban neighborhoods) has 6, and Be'er Sheva has 2, providing easy access to many parts of those cities.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTo differentiate from a shared taxi (sherut), a regular Israel taxi is sometimes called special (using the English word). The driver should use the meter both inside and outside cities (in Hebrew, moneh), unless the passenger agrees to prefix a price (agreeing to go off the meter is almost universally in the driver's favor). There are surcharges; for calling a taxi by phone (\u20aa5 as of January 2013), for luggage (\u20aa4.20 a piece), for more than 2 passengers (\u20aa4.70 (fixed), passengers that are children under the age of 5 are not taken into account), for taking toll-routes and for hailing a taxi at airports or seaports (Ben Gurion airport - \u20aa5, Haifa seaport - \u20aa2).\nDrivers are known to try to scam tourists by not turning on the meter to begin with and then fighting about the cost at the end of the ride. It is best to specify that you absolutely require the 'moneh' to be activated before you leave unless you know how much the trip should cost, in which case you can make a deal. However, if you are caught off guard some drivers will become extremely rude or even violent if you refuse to pay despite the meter never having been switched on. It is best to try to avoid this situation, but it is better to avoid any conflict with the driver by paying and learning rather than saving your money and risking an unpredictable escalation. Noting the taxi's number (clearly visible on the outside of the cab) and contacting the local taxi authority is an efficient form of redress.\nA good way of avoiding scams is to order taxis with the Gett/GetTaxi smartphone app. Gett use only licensed taxi drivers and the same fare structure as any other taxi ride. It gives the fixed price or meter price directly to you, allows for credit card payment (none of the \"I have no change\" nonsense), and you can put in your specific destination and see that the driver isn't taking a roundabout route to run the meter up.\nIsraeli taxi drivers do not expect a tip, and neither should you generally offer one. In addition, they are more likely to round the fare down to the nearest shekel than up.\nAll Israeli taxis are numbered, and all print out an official receipt on printers attached to their meters (if you request), useful if you are traveling on business.\nRidehailing is available in Israel. Gett is a local option, Uber works also in Tel Aviv and Yango works in Ashdod, Ashkelon, Beer Sheva, Haifa, Herzliya, Hod HaSharon, Petah Tikva, Rishon Le-Zion and Tel Aviv.\n\n\nBy thumb\nMost major junctions have a shelter and are well lit throughout the night.\nHitchhiking is more accepted in rural areas, particularly sparsely populated areas like the Golan Heights or between smaller towns in the West Bank that have little bus service, than in cities. Local West Bank settlers rely heavily on hitch-hiking for transportation. Almost every car will stop and suggest a lift if you stand in any settlement's gate as most of them are defended by IDF soldiers. Nevertheless, inside the West Bank you should never hitchhike from Jewish settlements/cities to Palestinian areas (or vice-versa); this is dangerous.\nDo not hitchhike in a car that stopped for you unprompted.\nRead through Wikivoyage general guide, which provides a lot of good advice on the how, where and when of Hitchhiking.\n\n\nBy car\n\n\nRoad system\nIsrael has a modern highway network, connecting all destinations throughout the country. In general, avoid traveling by car: traffic is significant in all hours, drivers are aggressive, road signage is confusing, and parking is scarce and expensive.\nRoad signs often follow city names (rather than compass directions). That means that you will see signs to Road 1 Jerusalem and Road 1 Tel Aviv, rather than Road 1 West and Road 1 East, so generally you must follow the name of the largest city at the direction of your destination, even if it is not marked. For example, when traveling from Haifa to Be'er Sheva, you will need to travel southwards which means to follow signs directing you to Tel Aviv. When approaching Tel Aviv, you will start to see directions to Be'er Sheva. When getting directions, it's best to ask for the name of an exit as well as the exit just before it.\nRoads are numbered according to orientation and significance. In general, east-west roads are given odd numbers, and north-south roads are given even numbers. Numbers generally increase from south to north, and east to west. The most significant national highways are numbered using one or two digits, while the least significant local roads are numbered using four digits. Exceptions to these rules do exist.\n\n\nDriving regulations\n\nTraffic in Israel drives on the right. Traffic signs and regulations are standard and resemble those of Western Europe. Highway signage is usually in Hebrew, Arabic, and English, although sometimes just in Hebrew and English. Having signs in 3 languages (Hebrew, English, Arabic) usually makes signs overloaded with text, thus only the name of the destination is written in text and a pictogram is used for the type of destination. Usually, each traffic light has an arrow on top, and the traffic light then controls travel to the indicated direction, with a green light guaranteeing that all conflicting traffic faces a red light. Lights without arrows above them control all directions. Red light always means stop. Turning right or left at a red light is strictly forbidden. There is no turning left or right while yielding to opposite traffic, since conflicting traffic always faces a red light, even in the absence of arrows (however, this is not always the case with pedestrians, particularly when turning right). As in several other countries, the green phase is preceded by a red+yellow combination phase. A flashing green light indicates that the yellow light is about to appear, but can usually be found only on roads with speed limits of at least 60 km/h.\nWhite road markings are used to separate both traffic travelling in the same direction and in opposite directions. Yellow lines are used to mark the outer edges of the road (do not cross these, except if stopping at a shoulder), and orange or red lines are used in road works zones or following a change in road signs. Traffic circles (roundabouts) are very common; one gives way to cars already in the circle. There are no all-way stop signs like the ones the USA, Canada, and South Africa. All stop signs require drivers to yield to all conflicting traffic after coming to a complete stop.\nHeadlights must be turned on (even during the day) on intercity highways from November to March. Motorcyclists have to have their headlights on in all months of the year. Seat belts must be worn at all times in all seats. Using a mobile phone without a hands-free system is forbidden. If one must exit the vehicle on the shoulder of a highway, it is required to put on a reflective vest in order to promote visibility. It is required to keep the reflective vest at all times within the passenger's cabin of the vehicle, and not in the trunk. Car rental companies are required to supply such a vest and it is usually inside the glove compartment.\nParking regulations are indicated by curb markings:\n\nRed and white \u2014 Parking is prohibited, although this rule is often flouted outside weekday daytimes. However, just because others are doing so, doesn't mean your car won't be fined or towed.\nRed and yellow \u2014 Reserved for certain vehicles, such as buses at bus stops.\nBlue and white \u2014 Parking only with a parking permit purchased at a machine. There is not always a machine nearby, if so, cellphone payment system must be used. In some areas, such as in parts of Tel Aviv, blue and white markings are restricted even at night to residents only. A sign at the beginning of the street, usually in Hebrew only, will detail the specific restrictions.\nRed and Grey \u2014 Reserved for residents, but might only be reserved at specific times as stated in signs.\nGrey \u2014 Areas are free to park at, unless a parking sign at the beginning of the street requires payment or restricts it.\nBlack and White \u2014 Marked for curb visibility, when no other coloring apply.\nIsrael uses the metric system of measurements. Default speed limits are 50 km/h in residential zones, 80 km/h on intercity roads without a physical separation median between opposing lanes, and 90 km/h on intercity roads with a physical separation median. By default, all major freeways (identified by the standard blue European motorway sign) have a speed limit of 110 km/h; however, in practice, speed limit signs bearing a lower limit (usually 90 km/h or 100 km/h) limit the speed on these roads.\nPolice presence on the roads is generally very significant, and speed and red light cameras are common. Both radar (mostly stationary) and LIDAR (laser, hand-held) are in use for speeding enforcement.\nPolice vehicles in active duty may have their blue lights turned on for the duration of their trip. Unlike most countries in the \"First World\", in Israel this is not a sign that they want to pull you over. If they do, they would either turn on their siren or use a loudspeaker to instruct you to stop on the shoulder. A verbal request, although usually made in Hebrew, will usually include the make of the car. It is advisable to comply.\n\n\nToll highways\n\n Highway 6 (Kvish Shesh - \u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9 6), \u260f +972 3 9081111, +972 3 9086116. electronic-toll-highway, unique in having no toll booths. Vehicles using it are identified by license plates and/or electronic tags, and bills are sent to the vehicle's registered owner. The price is determined by the number of road segments that are used::*On the main section (from 'Iron interchange to Sorek interchange) the minimum charge is for 3 segments (even if you drove through less segments) and the maximum charge is for 5 segments (even if you drove through more segments).:*On the northern segment (one segment from 'Iron interchange to Ein Tut interchange) there is a separate special charge, as it's not a part of the main section.:*The southern section (from Sorek interchange to Ma'ahaz interchange) is free of charge.:Various subscriptions are available. Consult your rental company regarding payment of highway 6 rides, as they often carry a surcharge.   (updated Mar 2021)\n18 6 North (Shesh Tzafon - 6 \u05e6\u05e4\u05d5\u05df), \u260f +972 3 9533929. The northern segments of Road 6. the road segments are: Yokneam tunnels (Toll), road 70 (Free), Somech tunnels (toll). 10 ILS for cars for all 6 North segments combined.  (updated Sep 2022)\n19 Carmel Tunnels (Minharot Ha'Carmel - \u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05de\u05dc), \u260f +972 4 6895424. A set of 4 tunnels (2 in each direction with the Neve Sha'anan interchange between them) that crosses Haifa under the Carmel mountain. The price is determined by the number of segments that you use (1 or 2 segments). Every vehicle must report at entry toll booths and again at an exit toll booth. 9.91 / 19.82 ILS for cars.   (updated Mar 2021)\n20 Fast Lane to Tel-Aviv (Hanativ Hamahir - \u05d4\u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05de\u05d4\u05d9\u05e8) (Entrance from Route 1 just before Ben-Gurion airport (thus no direct access from the airport itself)), \u260f +972 73 2100400, tofes@fastlane.co.il. 06:00-23:00. A 13km stretch from Route 1 (near Ben Gurion Airport), ending at the second highway exit to Tel Aviv, the Kibbutz Galuyot exit (only one direction). Vehicles going through the whole route must be registered in advance. The price is determined by the number of vehicles entering the lane, to keep traffic flowing smoothly. The maximum toll is \u20aa105, but is usually much less. Vehicles with at least 4 passengers (including the driver) may use the lane for free by making a stop at the toll booth. There is an unspoken agreement that if a uniformed soldier is with you in the car, the toll booth attendant lets you pass free even if there are only 3 passengers in the car (especially in the morning weekday hours). A formal free alternative is to leave your vehicle inside the lane's parking lot (which may get full very early in the morning), and take a free shuttle bus (every 15 minutes) to Tel Aviv (Kaplan road, mainly) or Ramat Gan (diamond exchange district, \"Bursa\"). With this alternative, after returning to your car with the shuttle bus, you must drive with the direction to Jerusalem or Rishon Le-Zion. Price depends on congestion of route 1, and may rise up to 105 ILS.  (updated Mar 2021)\n\n\nLicensing information\nAll drivers in Israel must carry a driver's license or ID. International driver permits, as well as licenses from foreign countries are accepted. Drivers of motor vehicles must be at least 17 years old, while insurance is mandatory. Driving a motorcycle or a moped is permitted starting at age 16. A driver's license is mandatory for two wheel vehicles as well! All cars in Israel must undergo an annual safety inspection, and a sticker bearing the month and year of the next inspection should appear on the front windshield. Every car is required to carry a yellow reflective vest at all times. Theoretically, the police could stop you at any time and ask to see it. If you stop on the edge of the road, and have to get out, you are required by law to wear the vest. All rental cars should have one, so it is a good idea to check before you leave. In Israel while you are driving, the police are allowed to stop you for any reason whatsoever; mostly they do so for license checkups. Shabby-looking vehicles get stopped far more often.\n\n\nSafety issues\nCar accident fatalities in Israel are on par with most European countries and less than half that of the US. However, Israeli drivers are known to be aggressive and impatient. Take this into consideration if you decide to drive in Israel, and use caution - be prepared for other drivers not to yield when they normally should and not to respect your right of way. Be especially cautious on two-lane intercity roads, especially when passing other vehicles. While most major highways have a physical separation median, many lower-traffic intercity roads do not. Also be particularly cautious when driving in the Negev desert, since most roads in that region have only two lanes carrying fast-moving traffic, and trips tend to last hours in the heat. Take care while traveling on Friday night and Saturday, the Jewish Shabbat, as roads tend to be emptier and invite faster, and occasionally more reckless, drivers. Also be more cautious in winter when it rains, as roads will be unusually slick. The first rainy days in fall are particularly dangerous, since the oil/grease and other substances that accumulated on the road all summer are released.\n\n\nCar rental\nMost major international car rental companies as well as many Israeli ones provide car rental services.\nYou will be charged VAT for your car rental if you do not produce a visa (for example, if you entered via Allenby and avoided the stamps, although the paper will do).\nIf you are going to Palestinian areas in the West Bank, your rental insurance may not cover the trip. Clarify exactly where you plan to go with the company before renting.\nCompanies:\n\n Hertz. \n Avis. (updated Oct 2024)\n Budget. \n Sixt (Shlomo). (updated Oct 2024)\n Europcar (Albar). \n Eldan.

The flight time is between 30 and 45 minutes. Expect 4-8 daily flights during wintertime and roughly hourly during the peak vacation times in July and August. The twp operators are Arkia and Israir. Despite its popularity, the Haifa-Eilat route is inactive since the previous decade.\nPrivate operators can arrange charter flights to one of the many airfields in the country (Rosh Pina, Kiryat Shmona, Meggido, Fik, Rishon LeTzion, Be'er Sheva, and Herzliya).\nFor aviation adventurers check Bar Yehuda Airfield (MTZ IATA), at 378 m (1,240 ft) below mean sea level the lowest airport in the world can be quite an experience.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nWhile there are some areas with a bikeshare system and even something of a cycling culture, Tel Aviv chief among them, and while you can see kids in secular cities fill the streets on their bikes on Yom Kippur, in general Israel is not a cycling country. Still, distances are short and some roads have not much traffic. Unfortunately there's not really any awareness of the tourism benefits of bikes and on some routes a four lane highway with no shoulder in the scorching desert sun are all your options. Bike carriage on Israel Railways is free outside of rush hour, however.\n\n\nOn foot and navigation\nIsrael is an excellent place for hiking and trekking, providing many interesting trails. However, due to the often remote nature of these trails (like the Ramon Crater or the Negev), it is important that you are well prepared and have a proper and reliable map with you. In addition, using GPS adds an extra layer of safety, both in cities as well as the countryside. For reliable (offline) maps, GPS navigation, comprehensive trails and map information, consult OpenStreetMap, which is also used by this travel guide, and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd and Mapy.cz. Or just download the according GPX or KML files through Waymarked Trails for such trails on OpenStreetMap. (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID to download additional GPX or KML files through the same link.)\n\n\nSee\n\n\nReligious sites\n\nIsrael is the core of the Holy Land, and both its land and its main sights are holy to billions of people of different faiths. Some of the world's most famous religious monuments are found here. Israel's capital Jerusalem is the holiest city in Judaism, and one of the holiest in Christianity and Islam. Jerusalem's walled Old City holds famous religious sites including the gold-plated Dome of the Rock, the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the al-Aqsa Mosque. Bordering Jerusalem (but administratively part of the Palestinian Territories) is Bethlehem, sacred in Christianity as the birthplace of Jesus. The Galilee region is also full of religious sites, including major Christian sites like Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee, as well as notable Jewish sites like the kabbalistic city of Tzfat and the pilgrimage site Meron. Along the Mediterranean coast are holy sites of the Bahai religion - the beautiful  Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Gardens in Haifa with the golden-domed Shrine of the B\u00e1b, and the Shrine of Baha'u'llah in Akko. The main pilgrimage site of the Druze religion, Nabi Shu'ayb, is also in the Lower Galilee.\n\n\nHistoric sites\nIn addition, Israel contain numerous fascinating historic sites from across its thousands of years of recorded history. The City of David in Jerusalem contains remains from when King David conquered the city and made it his capital (around 1000 BCE), and even earlier. In Jerusalem, Megiddo, and Hatzor, you can explore underground water supply systems, tunneled through rock, from the Israelite period. Some of the most impressive ruins in Israel are from the Roman period. Masada, a stunning mountaintop fortress surrounded by cliffs near the Dead Sea, was used by Jewish rebels against Rome, and in modern times has become a symbol of Jewish heroism. Caesarea and Beit Shean are among the Roman cities in Israel, where you can see well-preserved commercial streets and amphitheaters. Later on, the Crusaders left castles in places like Akko (a beautiful seaside walled city) and Belvoir. Meanwhile, the equally impressive Nimrod fortress in the Golan Heights was built by their Muslim rivals. Other ruins from the Muslim period included the iconic walls of Jerusalem, and the underground cistern of Ramla, which you can explore by boat.\n\n\nThe people\nLively and modern Tel Aviv has a completely different atmosphere from Israel's historic sites, with a bustling nightlife (it is known as \"the city that never stops\") and young atmosphere. But try to get a glimpse of Israel's other different cultures too. Go to the Negev and partake in the hospitality of Bedouin Arab nomads, or go north and see a Druze village. And perhaps visit Meah Shearim in Jerusalem, where Haredi (\"Ultra-Orthodox\") Jews live as if they were still in a European shtetl. Whatever city you go to, be sure to see the local market - Jerusalem's Machaneh Yehudah and Tel Aviv's Carmel market might represent the Israeli people better than anything.\n\n\nNatural sites\nDespite its small size, Israel contains a wide variety of beautiful and sometimes-unique natural sites. The Dead Sea is the lowest place on earth, and its extremely salty water allows you to float on top while reading a newspaper. Israel has a long Mediterranean coastline, much of it consisting of relaxing beaches, some of it made of rock formations or lined with sandstone cliffs. The Red Sea coastline in Eilat is much shorter, but gives you the chance to scuba dive around coral reefs, or swim with dolphins. The Galilee is full of scenic forested mountains (with the bright blue Sea of Galilee nestled between them), while the Negev desert contains stark canyons and beautiful oases, including the Ramon crater which is the world's largest erosion crater. As the only way to get between Africa and Eurasia without crossing oceans, Israel is one of the world's best places for bird watching. The Soreq Cave with its stalagmites and stalactites is much like Israel as a whole - small compared to its peers elsewhere in the world, but packed with features in comparison to its size.\n\n\nMuseums\nJerusalem is home to the excellent Israel Museum, with a collection that includes the Dead Sea Scrolls and other archaeological treasures as well as works from artists such as Picasso, Rodin and Matisse. Equally impressive despite its sad theme is Yad Vashem, the largest Holocaust museum in the world. In Tel Aviv, Beit HaTefutsot is the best place to learn about the Jewish diaspora.\n\n\nDo\n\nHiking \u2014 Israel is a great place for wilderness backpacking, hiking and camping. A large variety of forest, desert, mountain, and coastline landscapes are all close together, close to cities and historic sites. Keep in mind the important guidelines.\nIsrael National Trail \u2013 a marked leisure trail (hiking or cycling) covering 940 km from north to south.\nJesus Trail \u2013 a hiking trail from Nazareth to Capernaum covering 65 km that connects major Christian sites in the Galilee.\nThe Nativity Trail, The path that Joseph and Mary followed to get to from the Sea of Galilee to Bethlehem\nNational parks and Reserves. Well maintained, brimming with beauty and history, these sites often come with interpretive material and maps in English and other foreign languages.\nThere are about 75 national parks and nature reserves in Israel. The entrance fees are between \u20aa20 and 40 and most of the time are discounted for international students.\nHistoric sites in Israel are heavily dotted with informational signs in Hebrew, English, and Arabic. This, in addition to the pamphlet you are given upon entering national parks, makes it easy to understand the significance of everything you see. In contrast to many other countries (Italy comes to mind) where signs are rare and you need to hire a tour guide to understand what you are seeing, here the sites are much more self-explanatory.\nIsraeli National Parks are usually closed before 8 and after 16/17:00 (winter/summer), which gives the opportunity for a free and spectacular sunrise or sunset (like the recommended one in Masada).\nArchaeological digs \u2013 given how much history took place here, archaeology has been a national pastime of modern Israel (though less now than a generation ago). In the early years of the state, archaeologists like Yigael Yadin became political leaders, while leaders like Moshe Dayan tried their hand as amateur archaeologists. There are still plenty of things left to find in the ground, and visitors to Israel can take part in a current archaeological dig. The shortest option is two hours long, in the Temple Mount Sifting Project in Jerusalem. For a longer dig, try Dig for a Day in Beit Guvrin. There are also many organized archaeological digs where you can volunteer for a period of weeks or a semester \u2013 for a list, see here.\nRafting on the northern Jordan River.\nRappelling or off-roading in the Negev.\nDiving: Israel has three seas: Red, Med and Dead. You only want to dive in the Red. Locals dive along the Mediterranean coast, and important marine archaeological finds are being made in those waters, but conditions are more challenging and there's far less to see than in the Red Sea. The Dead Sea has actually been dived, in the sort of kit you'd need to explore Venus, but there's no coral or fish. And then there's the freshwater Sea of Galilee: simply no reason to dive it. The Red Sea coast is all of 4 km in the city of Eilat, sandwiched between the Egyptian and Jordanian borders. It's easy reef diving and snorkeling, and the highlight is the Marine Park around Moses Rock. But it's a small coastline to absorb a lot of floundering bodies. It's good for learning, but experienced divers will probably only want a couple of days diving there as part of a broader tour of Israel.\nClubbing in Tel Aviv\nSkiing at the Hermon snow resort (open only in mid-winter)\nMany Israeli website guides have an English version and can be used for making plans:\n\nTiuli \u2014 hiking and field trips\nIsrael National Trail \u2014 Maps and other resources\nKKL-JNF\nTimeout - Digital edition\nTripAdvisor\n\n\nBackpacking\nIsrael is not a big backpacking/hosteling country. In addition, hitchhiking is not that common anymore (though still possible), which makes it hard and time-consuming for a traveler on a shoestring to save money.\nWhereas in the West Bank or Jordan it is common to get a discount when turning up at an accommodation directly, in Israel only a few hostels appreciate such or direct bookings without using the monopolistic middle man. And you might even end up paying more when turning up out of the blue.\nMany beautiful nature sites in Israel have been converted into national parks, which demand an entrance fee of \u20aa20-40. There is a combined park ticket available, which might save you some money if you plan to visit 10 or more over a couple of weeks. This makes it even harder for backpackers who are out in the open very often and just want to let themselves drift through the country.\nHowever, besides those troubles, there are some great hikes and nature spots in Israel (even for free), and many free camping options if you bring a tent.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nCosts\nIsrael is expensive. Prices are similar to the upper end prices of western and northern Europe.\n\n\nMoney and payments\n\n Israel's currency is the New Israeli Shekel (\u05e9\u05e7\u05dc \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9 or \u05e9\"\u05d7), which is often known simply as the Shekel. It is shortened in English to ILS or NIS. It's denoted by the symbol \u20aa. One shekel is 100 agorot. The plural of \"shekel\" in Hebrew is \"shkalim\".\nThe coins in use are 10 agorot, \u20aa1/2 (copper), \u20aa1, \u20aa2, \u20aa5 (nickel) and \u20aa10 (bi-metallic; copper core, nickel rim). Banknotes in use are \u20aa20, \u20aa50, \u20aa100 and \u20aa200.\nContactless mobile/card payments with Google Pay, Apple Pay, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover are widely accepted and commonly used.  Card payments (but not mobile payments) over 300 shekels require PIN code verification.\nSmaller shops may not accept mobile/card payments, but it's okay to ask. Self-service at fuel pumps requires a physical card.\nOnly some taxi drivers accept mobile/card payments. If you prefer not paying drivers directly, Uber and Gett apps operate in Israel.\nIf using cash, avoid using large bills for small charges. Avoid using foreign currencies, it will be at a rip-off exchange rate.\n\nATMs are available everywhere. Some ATMs have usage fees (they are displayed).\n\n\nVAT return\nA VAT of 17% is included in most prices. You can get VAT refunds when leaving the country, though be prepared to queue at the airport. VAT refunds are only granted for individual receipts in excess of \u20aa400 and subject to a few other conditions. Eilat is a VAT-free city for citizens as well as for foreigners, but being a resort city it is often more expensive to begin with. See VAT refund guidelines at the Israel government services portal and consult the Israel Post website, which provides the refund.\n\n\nTipping\nOutside of the food industry, tipping is not common. The norm for waiters is a 15% tip unless the service was horribly disrespectful. In bars where you sit down at the bar, tip 15%. In fast food restaurants, food stands, and in bars where you order your drink and go, don't tip.\nIn some fine-dining restaurants or when large groups are involved, it's possible for the service charge to be included in the bill. If this is the case, don't tip.\nFood delivery tip is commonly 10 shekels if service is good. For food app deliveries (e.g. Wolt) and restaurants that add a delivery charge, it's becoming less common to tip.\nIsraelis do not tip taxi drivers. Some taxi drivers attempt to guilt tourists to tip.\nSimilarly to the US, inappropriate tip solicitation has become widespread (tip jars, tipping screens, etc.). It's always okay not to tip when being solicited for tips. Never tip at tipping screens.\n\n\nBusiness hours\n\nIsraelis work five days a week, Sunday through Thursday. Friday and Saturday are considered the weekend, though schools are open Friday morning.\nIn Jewish areas, most shops are closed on the Sabbath (Shabbat), from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday. Shops are open Friday, but typically will close at about 14:30\u201315:00 with some shops closing as early as 12:00. Many shops, especially in malls, will re-open on Saturday evening, at about 19:00 in winter, and 20:30 in summer. Some shops, especially in Tel Aviv or outside city limits or in tourist areas, as well as 24-hour convenience stores (mostly found in fuel stations), remain open on Saturdays. In Arab towns, shops are generally open 7 days a week.\nShops in malls and on major shopping streets are generally open 09:30\u201321:00 daily. Banks, post offices, and some smaller shops follow unusual opening hours, so it's best to check.\nMarkets usually open and close early.\n\n\nBargaining\nBargaining in Israel is relatively common. A general guideline: sales agents, exaggerated prices, or no displayed prices \u2013 bargain. Anything that looks established or corporate \u2013 don't. In shops with displayed prices where you are not dealing with a sales agent \u2013 don't.\nBargaining in bazaars and rural markets is common yet subtle. Vigorous bargaining which is common in some countries will likely get you nowhere and is improper. If you are given a fair price, don't bargain for sport \u2013 it is frowned upon. Prices in tourist traps such as the Old City of Jerusalem can routinely be haggled down to as low as 25% of the asking price. Be sure to go shopping on your own, as some guides receive a commission for bringing in business.\nPrice comparison sites are Zap or Ret.\nIf you are bringing a large group of people to a club or a bar, it may be possible to negotiate a discount before arriving with the group. If you are already there, bargaining won't get you anything substantial.\n\nBargaining with taxi drivers over fare is possible, though rarely to your advantage. It is best to instruct them to use the meter (\"moneh\") if they don't already do so as required by law.\n\n\nEat\nWhile many popular dishes in Israel are typical of Middle Eastern cuisine, its cuisine is as diverse as the population. Food is generally of a very high standard, and immigrants from around the world brought almost every genre and type of food to Israel. Kosher food is widely available. Even restaurants without Kosher certificates follow some guidelines of Kashrut to some extent. Tipping is very common in sit-in places that have waiters \u2013 not tipping in sit-in restaurants is frowned upon, but is accepted for signaling atrocious service. It is standard to give 10%\u201315% (or more for exceptional service). A 20% tip is considered generous. Including a service charge in the bill is no longer legal in Israel and should not be paid. Restaurants may charge a \"security fee\" \u2013 roughly \u20aa1\u20132 per person. However, this fee is not mandatory, and it is common to ask for the fee to be removed from the bill, as well you should. Most restaurants accept credit cards, but do not accept personal checks. If you wish to include the tip in your credit card charge, state this before paying. Restaurants are required to allow this.\nPerhaps surprisingly, most culinary items that are typically associated with Jewish cuisine in much of the English-speaking world, such as bagels and pastrami, are not widespread in Israel, though they can still be found in eateries operated by American or Canadian immigrants. \nIf you need an English menu, ask for a \"tafrit b'anglit\".\n\n\nFast and popular\n\nIsraelis tend to consider falafel and hummus as national dishes, although these dishes do not originate in Israel and are eaten throughout the Levant region. A serving of Falafel includes falafel balls, which are small fried balls of mashed chickpeas and/or fava beans, usually served inside a pita bread (or its larger cousin, the lafa bread) with hummus-chips-salat (hummus, French fries and vegetable salad) and tahini. A selection of more salads is usually available, and you can fill your pita with as much as it can take. This is usually the cheapest lunch available (\u20aa10\u201315), and it's vegetarian (and often vegan). You can also order half a serving (\"hatzi mana\"). If you don't know which falafel joint to go to, pick one with a good flow of customers, because falafel balls are tastiest when extremely fresh. Hummus is a popular dip made of chickpea granules and various additions (such as olive oil, fresh garlic, lemon juice and tahini) and usually eaten with pieces of pita. At places that specialize in Hummus (commonly referred to as \"hummusiot\"), you can find the dish topped with chopped lamb, fried chicken breast, and many other different toppings, such as cooked masabacha grains, shakshuka, ground beef, pine nuts, fried onions, mushrooms, etc.\nAnother popular option is shawarma \u2013 sliced turkey or lamb meat, also served inside a pita/lafa with hummus-chips-salat toppings. Many other things can fit your pita: for example, Me'orav Yerushalemi (Jerusalemite mix), which contain several types of offal meat, or perhaps even schnitzel, a batter fried chicken breast which is somewhat inspired by the Viennese original.\nAnother street food gaining popularity is the Iraqi-origin sabikh: a pita bread stuffed with a hard boiled egg, batter-dipped deep fried eggplant, hummus, tehini, potatoes, and salad.\n\n\nDietary restrictions\nDue to the taboo against pork in Judaism and Islam, pork is rare in Israel, and the import of live pigs and pork products is illegal. That said, exceptions are made for the Christian minority to rear pigs and produce pork products domestically, so pork can be found at shops and restaurants catering to the Christian community, but expect to pay a steep premium for it.\n\n\nKosher food\n\nIsraeli cuisine is heavily influenced by the ancient Jewish laws of kosher food. The word kosher means anything that is allowed by Jewish religious laws, in this case food laws. Among other things kashrut requires complete segregation of meat and dairy foods, dishes and utensils; select types of fish are kosher but most 'sea foods' are not; meat must undergo a ritual slaughter process; and all foods must be prepared under controlled and monitored conditions. Kosher restaurants and hotels display a valid, dated certificate issued by local rabbinical authorities; kosher restaurants close for the Shabbat. Because of the meat-and-milk restrictions, kosher restaurants bill themselves as either \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9 (b'sari, \"meat\") or \u05d7\u05dc\u05d1\u05d9 (chalavi, dairy). Dairy restaurants will also serve fish (as Jewish law does not consider fish to be meat), and egg products. If you find cheeseburgers or pizzas with meat toppings in a kosher restaurant, they are made from soy or other substitutes for either the meat or the cheese.\nDue to the secular nature of much of Israel, both kosher and non-kosher foods and restaurants can be found. Restaurants in Arab areas rarely follow kosher laws (unless they cater to a mixed clientele), though they often follow halal laws (the Muslim equivalent).\nExcept some boutique hotels, all the hotels in Israel observe kosher rules.  Breakfast is dairy: meat at breakfast \u2013 especially bacon and sausages \u2013 is impossible to find in hotels and cafes in Israel. On the other hand, during lunch and dinner you'll not be able to get milk for your coffee or butter for your bread (although soy milk and spread are common substitutes). Most big supermarkets sell only kosher products, but more and more non-kosher supermarkets and convenience stores have appeared, due in part to the many secular Jews who have immigrated from the former USSR. With restaurants, things vary by location: in Tel Aviv a large proportion of restaurants are non-kosher, while in West Jerusalem nearly all restaurants are kosher. Restaurants that remain open on Shabbat cannot receive kosher certification. So some restaurants serve kosher food while not being certified, but not every restaurant that claims this is strict about the other kosher rules.\nOne attraction for practicing Jewish (and other) tourists is the kosher McDonald's restaurants. Most of the branches are not kosher, so ask before ordering. Burger Ranch, an Israeli burger chain, is kosher. Pizza Hut branches in Israel are kosher, and thus will not serve pizzas with meat toppings, while Domino's chains are not kosher, and serve a toppings selection similar to their Western branches.\nOne pitfall with finding kosher food is that some con-men have found they can make money by selling fake kashrut certificates. Therefore, someone looking for kosher food should look for a certificate from the local rabbinate or a recognized kashrut agency. Certificates from unknown organizations should not be relied upon.\nThe word for kosher is pronounced kasher (\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e9\u05b5\u05e8) in Modern Hebrew, while the Hebrew word for \"fitness\" is Kosher (in Israel, gyms are known as kheder kosher, i.e. fitness room). The words have the same root \u2013 kosher food is food that is \"fit\" to eat for religious Jews.\n\n\nDietary restrictions during Passover\nAnother series of strict restrictions come into force during the seven days of Passover, when leavened bread (Hametz) \u2014 taken to include any grain product that may have come into contact with moisture and thus started fermenting \u2014 is banned. The religiously defined limit is 18 minutes. Any grain product that's come into contact with water for more than 18 minutes is considered \"hametz\". Some Jews even widen the ban to cover rice and legumes. The main substitute for the bread is matza, the famously dry and tasteless flatbread, and you can even get a matzoburger from McDonald's during Passover.\n\nReligious sectors will completely remove Hametz from their properties. Because the restriction is only for 7 days, many shops don't remove Hametz from shelves and vending machines, but only cover them or visually hide them. In more observant shops, cashier machines will not recognize the Hametz products during Passover, so it'd be hard to purchase them even after they are un-hidden. Note that as hametz owned by Jews must be nominally sold to a non-Jew before the holiday and cannot be repurchased on the Sabbath, many restaurants that are normally open on Shabbat will be closed the day after Passover when it falls on a Saturday, or will continue to serve their Passover menu.\n\n\nProminent local snacks\n\n Krembo (\u05e7\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\u05d5 A hybrid of the words KREM and BO, \"Cream\" and \"In it\", respectively). A favorite Israeli chocolate snack. It is composed of a round cookie, on which cream (most often vanilla-flavored, but there is also a mocha variety) lies, covered with a chocolate shell. Krembos come wrapped in aluminum foil, and are very delicate. They are rarely found in the summer due to their tendency to melt in hot weather.   \n Bamba (\u05d1\u05de\u05d1\u05d4). A popular peanut butter-flavored snack which is one of the leading snack foods produced and sold in Israel. Israelis have low rates of peanut allergies, because they eat Bamba as kids.   \n Bissli (\u05d1\u05d9\u05e1\u05dc\u05d9). A popular wheat snack sold in various flavors such as onions, Falafel and barbecue.   \n\n\nEthnic food\nJews immigrating to Israel from different parts of the world brought with them many different cooking traditions. Most of these are now served in a handful of specialty restaurants, so check the individual chapters and ask around. Among the selection: Ashkenazi (Eastern European Jewish), Bulgarian, Turkish, North African, Iraqi, Iranian, Indian and Ethiopian. One can also enjoy excellent local Arab cuisine served in areas with large Arab populations, mostly in the north of the country and in the vicinity of Jerusalem.\n\nOne dish, however, is known across nearly the entire Jewish Diaspora. Known in Europe as Cholent and in the Middle East and North Africa as Chamin, it is a sort of stew that has simmered for many hours over a low fire. It is traditionally a Shabbat dish, originating from the prohibition on lighting fire and cooking on Shabbat. The exact ingredients vary, but it usually contains meat (usually beef or chicken), legumes (chickpeas or beans) and\\or rice, eggs, and vegetables such as potatoes, onions, and carrots. Chamin is served in some restaurants on Saturday, and can be bought in delicatessens on Friday.\nMost Israelis enjoy instant coffee and will order it in restaurants and shops. The quality of this coffee is often quite high. However, Israelis also appreciate a caf\u00e9 culture. While concoctions such as \"botz\" (mud) coffee, also known as \"cafe turki\" or Turkish coffee (an inexpensive extra-finely ground coffee, often spiced with cardamom, that is cooked on a stove and served unfiltered/unstrained) are popular, the coffee culture in Israel has become refined and the quality has drastically increased in the last couple of decades. High quality espresso has replaced instant coffee as the base of most coffee drinks. There are several highly popular local coffee chains and numerous independent coffee shops. Many Israelis like to just spend time sipping their caf\u00e9 latt\u00e9 (the most popular coffee in caf\u00e9s) and chatting with friends. You can also have a light meal with sandwiches and salads. Aroma is Israel's largest coffee chain that has good coffee. You can order sandwiches there in three sizes and choose from three types of bread. Arcaff\u00e9 is slightly more expensive, but their coffee is a little better. Other chains include Elite Coffee, cafe cafe, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, and Cafe Hillel (of which some branches are Kosher dairy). Israelis frown upon US-style coffee, and Starbucks failed miserably in Israel because their coffee was considered inferior by the locals.\n\n\nVegetarians and vegans\n\nVegetarians and vegans should have a relatively easy time eating in Israel. Due to the kosher law against mixing meat and milk, there are many \"dairy\" restaurants that serve no meat, which makes them popular with vegetarians. Be aware that these often serve fish. In some parts of the country you can also find vegan restaurants. Amirim is a vegetarian/vegan village in the Upper Galilee with several restaurants. \"Israeli Salad\" (sometimes called Arab or Chopped salad) is a chopped salad of finely diced tomato and cucumber. It is very common and can be found virtually in every food-serving establishment. It is common for sit-down restaurants to indicate on their menus which dishes are vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nAlcoholic beverages\nThe drinking age in Israel is 18. Drinking and driving is illegal and actively prosecuted. Also, sale of alcohol outside of bars and restaurants and public drinking are prohibited between 23:00 and 05:00.\nThe most active nightlife can be found in Tel Aviv and Eilat. Tel Aviv, \"the city that never sleeps\", is Israel's party capital with a vast number of bars and clubs. Compared to much of Europe, drinking is rather expensive and the steep prices in Tel Aviv in particular are sometimes cited as a reason for the rather large community of young Israeli expats in Berlin.\n\n\nBeer\n\nThere are three main brands of Israeli beer:\n\nGoldstar \u2014 a Munich-style dark draught, it is the most popular Israeli beer in Israel. Can be found in bottles and cans of 0.5 and 0.3 liters (1 pint and half a pint, respectively), or \u05d7\u05e6\u05d9 KHE-tsi and \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05e9 shlish (Hebrew for \"half\" and \"third\". Referring to the amount based on litres, as Israel uses SI units). It is also available from tap (\u05de\u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea meh ha-kha-VIT, Hebrew for \"from the barrel\"). Some say it pairs deliciously with Bissli, a snack food indigenous to the area.\nMaccabee \u2014 a pilsner, lighter and smoother than Goldstar. Comes in bottles, cans or from tap. This beer has a bad reputation in Israel as being of foul taste. Its recipe has been changed and the beer has been regaining popularity in Israel. Still, due to its bad reputation many bars do not serve it. The local variety of Maccabee tastes differently than the exported one.\nNesher \u2014 comes in bottles, mostly malt.\nPalestinian beers are also available:\n\nTaybeh \u2014 made in the first micro-brewery in the Middle East, \"Taybeh Beer Brewery\" is from Taybeh village, a short taxi ride distance from Ramallah, an extremely fresh and delicious beer that is popular with many Palestinians, Israelis and tourists alike. It is mainly found in Israeli Arab communities, Jerusalem, and Palestinian cities. Taybeh Brewery offers free tours of the facilities and has \u20aa5 beers for sale at the brewery. Taybeh village also hosts its very own Oktoberfest-style beer festival held annually during the first week of October. The festival well-attended with foreign tourists and is growing in popularity.\nLately, several brands of micro-breweries have established themselves, and a wide selection of boutique beers such as Sins-Brewery, Bazelet, Golda, Laughing Buddha, Asif, Dancing Camel and many others can be found in selected alcohol houses and in some chain retail stores.\nIn addition, a wide variety of international brands are available throughout Israel, some of which are locally brewed. Among the most popular are Heineken, Carlsberg and Tuborg.\n\n\nLiqueurs\nA common liqueur in Israel is Arak. It is clear, and anise-flavored, quite similar to Pastis or the Colombian Aguardiente. It is usually served in a glass of about 0.3 L, mixed with equal amount of water and ice leading to a characteristic milk-like opaqueness. Some like to drink it mixed with grapefruit juice. Arak is usually kept in the freezer. A common brand is called Aluf Ha-Arak and Elit Ha-Arak (both of the same distillery) with the former of higher alcohol per volume and the latter of stronger anise flavor. They are of slightly different volume although the price is accordingly different.\n\n\nWines\n\nThere are several local big vineyards and a growing selection of boutique ones, some of them of high quality. Wine is mentioned in the Torah and Israeli winemaking tradition goes back to before the Roman conquest. Much of Israeli wine is kosher. Kosher wine has historically had a terrible reputation that is mostly unjustified in the 21st century and has been fading due to the good quality of many kosher wines becoming more widely known among connoisseurs and the wider public alike. The Golan Heights are among the premier wine growing regions under Israeli control.\n\n\nSoft drinks\nMost of the regular Western soft drinks are available, and many have local variants that aren't very different in taste. The Coca-Cola Company, RC Cola, and PepsiCo fight for the soft drink market aggressively. Israeli Coca-Cola is thought by Cola connoisseurs to be tastier and more authentic than elsewhere, because it is made with sugar, not with high-fructose corn syrup. Tempo (not to be confused with Tempo Industries, Ltd. which is the brewer of most Israeli beer and bottler of most soft drinks including the local Pepsi) and Super Drink are dirt-cheap local variants, at times sporting very weird tastes.\nThe generic name for Coke or Pepsi is \"cola\", and it usually implies Coca-Cola; if the place serves Pepsi, they will usually ask if it's fine. \"Soda\" generally means \"soda water\", and is not a generic name for carbonated soft drinks.\nThere are several more authentic soft drinks:\n\nTropit \u2014 cheap fruit flavor drink which is usually grape. Comes in a tough aluminum-like bag with a straw. The bag is poked using the straw to make a hole through which you drink. A very portable drink (until holed), which has become very popular in summer camps. In the newer varieties there is a marked area where the straw should be inserted. Even then it can sometimes take practice to insert the straw without the juice squirting out, it's similar to \"Capri Sun.\"\nChocolate milk \u2014 there are a number of brands of sterilized chocolate milk (SHO-ko) which comes in plastic bags and small cartons. The tip of the bag is bitten or clipped off, and the milk is sucked out. As with Tropit, it is very portable (although due to its milky nature, not as much) until opened, after which it is impractical to reseal. Chocolate milk in a bag is usually served cold, and it would be a very bad idea to warm it.\nSpring Nectar \u2014 fruit flavored drinks that come in cans or 1.5L bottles. Sold in most supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations, as well as many take-away stands. Comes in a number of flavors such as peach, mango, and strawberry.\nPrigat \u2014 fruit flavored drink that comes in plastic bottles. Is sold at pretty much every supermarket, petrol station and corner-store around Israel. Comes in many flavors including grape, orange, apple, tomato and a few more exotic options as well.\nPrimor \u2014 fruit juice in plastic bottles. Sold pretty much everywhere. Comes in many flavors, mostly citrus and apples.\n\n\nSleep\n\nIsrael is host to a huge variety of accommodation options, from camping and hostels through to 5-star luxury hotels. Accommodation in Israel is similar to Western standards in general both in terms of price and what you can expect as service. Hotels in Israel do not have star ratings, so beware that where these are seen, they are awarded by the hotels themselves.\nHostel/hotel owners in Israel do not appreciate it when you turn up onsite and ask for the best price leaving out the monopolistic middle man. Hence, you should instead book online (through their website, or one of the many commercial websites) or by phone, and take the best price you can get. Also, accommodations seem to use confusing US$ quotes and then demand shekels on purpose to prevent comparability. Make sure to always get the shekel (NIS) quote and demand to pay what was agreed on in shekels.\nThere are many free camp grounds available in Israel, especially in the Negev, which offer a great alternative to save some money. Most of the time you won't even need a tent, because rain and mosquitoes (and such) are sparse in the Negev.\nFurther remarks:\n\nIsrael Hostels (ILH), a network of 40 independent hostels, guest houses and lodges designed for independent travellers. They hand out visiting cards you can use at the next ILH to get 5% discount, so ask for them. Even so, make sure to confirm the price beforehand by calling or online, the quoted prices from their website/flyers do not always seem to be reliable.\nIsrael Youth Hostel Association (IYHA) runs a thriving network of youth hostels, but is generally more expensive than the former one.\nThe Israel Hotel Association (IHA)  is the umbrella organization for Israel's hotels and also represents them. About 350 hotels, from Metulla in the North to Eilat in the South, are members of the IHA.\nA large number of kibbutzim now include bed and breakfast accommodation among their activities.\nA number of private residencies (popular in northern communities) offer a room to let (commonly known as \"zimmer\", from the German word for room).\nIsrael has a number of 3\u20134 star hotel chains.\nIsrael has a large number of boutique hotels and one large chain of boutique hotels, Atlas Hotels\nIn the Negev Desert, there are multiple Bedouin camps that offer shelter and an unforgettable desert experience. You may be able to ride a camel, depending on the camp.\nDue to a Jewish religious prohibition on couples sharing a bed during certain periods in the woman's menstrual cycle, most king-sized beds at hotels are actually two smaller beds pushed together, which can be separated if necessary. It is therefore possible for two travellers who are not in a romantic relationship to book a room with one king bed if nothing else is available, then separate it into two separate beds.\n\n\nLearn\nTraditional Jewish culture places a strong emphasis on education and scholarship, and the country has many well-regarded universities. Special programs for students from abroad are offered by the Rothberg International School at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the Lowy School for Overseas Students at Tel-Aviv University and the Ginsburg-Ingerman Center for International Student Programs at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Be'er Sheva. Also the Technion in Haifa and Recanati International School in the Interdisciplinary Centre in Herzliya offer international programmes for foreign students.\nThe International School for Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem in West Jerusalem also offers a variety of educational options relating to the Holocaust or you could also use your time in Israel to study Hebrew. Hebrew school is called Ulpan (pl. Ulpanim).\nThere are even ways to learn Hebrew online from outside Israel - try Hebrew Online Guide, or Virtual Ulpan if you want some basic background for free.\nA good starting point for finding more information on study and volunteering programs, can be found on the website of the World Zionist Organization.\nIf you are interested in learning firsthand about the social, political and cultural aspects of life in Israel, there are several programs and organizations offering courses, workshops or learning tours, such as: The All Nations Caf\u00e9 in the Jerusalem - Bethlehem area.\n\n\nWork\nIf you are Jewish and plan on moving to Israel (aliyah), you will have more help finding a job. Generally speaking, it is close to impossible to immigrate to Israel unless you are Jewish or married to an Israeli citizen. Non-Jewish foreigners are typically restricted to working in Israel for no more than 5 years.\nOne of the iconic activities in Israel is working (\"volunteering\") on a collective farm: a kibbutz or a moshav.\nAnother popular option is to volunteer for work on an archaeological excavation, mostly conducted in summer at a variety of locations. Most Israeli excavations offer college/degree credit for international students.\nWorking on a tourist visa is illegal.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nEmergency phone numbers:\n\nPolice (mish-ta-RA) \u2014 100\nAmbulance Service (\"Magen David Adom\"-MADA, literally \"Red Star of David\") \u2014 101\nFire department (me-kha-BEY ESH) \u2014 102\nHome Front Command (civil defense) \u2014 104\nA list of rights for people who have been harmed during 2024 fighting, along with physical and mental support centers, is provided at the National Insurance website.\nWhen there is no fighting on the Lebanese or Gaza Strip borders, travel to Israel is quite safe, and crime rates are well below those found in most other Western countries. Some Palestinians have deliberately driven cars or other vehicles into crowds waiting for the Jerusalem Light Rail, for example. However, statistically, the chances of being involved in a traffic accident are much higher than the chances of being involved in an attack.\nIt is still a good idea to stay informed of developments before and during your stay. Caution should be used particularly in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and areas surrounding the Gaza Strip (particularly the cities of Sderot and Ashkelon, which have been targeted by rockets from the Strip). If you see anyone acting suspiciously, or find an unattended parcel, notify the police. Also, never leave a bag unattended in a public area, as it may be suspected as a bomb.\nPolice in Israel wear light blue or very dark navy clothing with flat caps, while Israeli Border Police (similar in function to Gendarmerie) wear dark grey uniforms with green berets or police ball caps. It is not unusual to see plenty of soldiers (and sometimes civilians) carrying firearms (military rifles and handguns) in public. Most of these soldiers are simply on leave from their base. Soldiers have no authority over civilians, except in specially designated zones near borders or military bases, where they are allowed to detain you until the arrival of a police officer.\nIn terms of typical crime, Israel is a very safe country with one of the lowest crime rates in the world. You can walk around the cities and towns at night without fear, as mugging and drunken violence are rare. Single women should still take care late at night, but the risks here are far lower than practically anywhere in Europe and America.\nIt is very common (even required by law) to see private armed security guards at every public doorway (for malls, stores, restaurants, etc.). The guards ask to look in your bags and may use a metal-detector on your body. When entering underground parking lots, the trunk of your car will be inspected. Do not be alarmed: this is just national policy. If you carry a huge backpack, you can often get away with showing a passport, and the guards will be just as relieved as you.\nIsrael's relations with its neighbors should always be something that a traveler should be familiar with, as evidenced by the Israeli\u2013Lebanese conflict of 2006. Despite the current ceasefire there remains a low danger that the conflict will again erupt. Israel has stable relations with both Egypt and Jordan, with which Israel signed peace treaties in 1979 and 1994 respectively. The frontier between the Israeli-ruled part of the Golan Heights and Syria has also generally been quiet since 1974, but there have been attempts by Hezbollah to place missile batteries in the Syrian-controlled part of the Golan Heights, and some stray rockets from the Syrian civil war have hit the Israeli-controlled part of the Golan Heights.\nFighting and hostilities resumed in mid-2014 between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, affirming that all travel to the Gaza Strip area should be avoided, and in the past several noted foreigners (even volunteers) have been kidnapped by armed militants during escalations. As of spring 2024 there is a full-scale Israeli invasion, with the intent of eliminating Hamas; 1\u20132% of the population have been killed. Israel does not allow travel to the Strip; the only way in is via Egypt. And even then, Egypt keeps the border shut most of the time. You might have better luck if you're a journalist, though.\nBecause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Muslim-Jewish disputes over the status of the Temple Mount/Haram el-Sharif, violent clashes can sometimes break out in and around that holy place, and these often include stones being thrown at Jewish worshippers at the Western Wall below. Check on current conditions before going to that part of the Old City of Jerusalem.\nHiking trails in southern Israel (and in the Golan) are adjacent to military fire practice areas. If you are not certain where you are going, do not hike in this region. These firing areas are marked on the official hiking maps.\nOn a similar note, especially near border areas, hiking or leaving the roadways, be aware of standing and fallen fences with a sign (yellow with a red triangle on it). These areas are considered off limits due to the possibility of land mines being present. It could take another 100 years to clear out all those areas. Also refer to the War zone safety article.\nIf it's raining or there's a possibility of rain in the area, do not hike in or near rivers or in the desert. Flash floods are common and dangerous. They are very sudden. If you're hiking in a river bed or in a low area and it starts raining, immediately seek higher ground. Stay away from river banks next to fast moving waters as they tend to collapse unexpectedly.\n\n\nRocket attacks\nWhen a rocket attack is detected as being fired towards Israel, alerts are provided in several means:\n\nA rising-and-falling audible siren alarm\nNotification messages on smartphone apps\nTV notification \u2013 major TV channels show an overlay with an orange colored notification\n\nSmartphone apps that provide such an alarm work either by GPS location, or pre-defined alert location. Some of these apps are:\n\n Home Front Command - Official App\u200f. provides alerts, the official and up-to-date guidelines and information in real time according to location and areas of interest, along with updates during emergencies. The app supports smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs. The app is available in Hebrew, Arabic, Russian and English. Their website includes real-time alerts (as do most Israeli news websites), additional information, and long term alerts log. (updated Oct 2024)\n Tzofar-Red Alert (\u05e6\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d1\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d3\u05d5\u05dd). An additional app, with alerts provided through google-chrome extention, browser tab, and alert logs and maps through telegram, WhatsApp, X (Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook. (updated Oct 2024)\nRed Alert:Israel\nPlease note that due to the need to stay online 24/7 these apps may prevent devices from going into energy-saving and data-saving modes (depends on device and capabilities), so they may drain faster than usual.\nUpon receiving an alert for a rocket attack, the time you have to defend yourself may vary. As a general rule, the closer you are to the launch site the less time you have following the start of the alert. If you are in a border town, for example, you only have fifteen seconds before the rocket lands.\nWhen an alarm sounds, you must take cover according to these instructions:\n\nEnter a nearby Shelter. Depending on the building the shelter can be inside apartments, a shared shelter for every floor in the building, or a shared basement shelter for the entire building. About half of all buildings in Israel have a shelter, and there are public shelters available in many common areas within Israeli cities. If you are in public, look for where other people go.\nIn a building without a shelter, enter the most protected room. This may be the inner-most room, or a staircase (when it is not external). If you are in a building, be sure to note where your nearest shelter is.\nwhen outside head for a building, and place yourself as far as you can from windows, or other fragile objects near the windows.\nWhen no building is nearby, lie down on your belly and put your hands on your head.\nWhen in a vehicle and not enough time to leave it, bend down below the windows height, and use your hand or nees to protect the head.\nThe full and updated list of instructions is available on HFC's website.\nThe most powerful rockets are capable of hitting nearly anywhere in the country, but most of the rockets impact:\n\nIn case of a conflict with the Gaza Strip, within a radius between Ashkelon in the west, Jerusalem in the east, Beersheba in the south, and Tel Aviv in the north.\nIn case of a conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah, the area near or north of Haifa.\nIf you are within these areas, be alert, and outside of these areas still be vigilant, as rockets from Gaza have hit Haifa, the Negev desert, and even the West Bank in the past.\nIsrael's \"Iron Dome\" launches missiles to intercept incoming rockets, but only when they are headed toward populated areas. Also, it is not 100% effective, and even when it registers a \"hit\" it creates shrapnel which eventually reaches the ground. \nMake sure to check the calendar for memorial days (around April or May), when a commemoration siren is heard at 10:00 for 2 minutes during Holocaust Remembrance Day, and on Yom-Hazikaron at 20:00 for one minute and at 11:00 for two more minutes. Commemoration sirens don't rise and fall. In general, behave the way others around you do.\n\n\nLGBT\n\nUnlike in much of the Middle East, homosexuality is legal in Israel. In fact, some gay rights advances happened in Israel earlier than in Western countries such as the U.S.A. Attitudes towards homosexuality will vary depending on where you go, but in general, Israel is considered safe for gays and lesbians, as violence is rare and open disapproval is mostly confined to certain parts of Jerusalem and religious neighborhoods. Same-sex marriages are legally recognized, although same-sex marriages are not performed in Israel.\nAll three major cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa) have an annual \"Pride\" parade, and the annual Love Parade in Tel Aviv gets cheering spectators too. Though Jerusalem has an annual pride parade, it is not very common to see openly gay people in Jerusalem, and you should avoid openly showing your sexual orientation in most public places in Jerusalem or other visibly religious places. In general just try to avoid public displays of homosexual affection or conversation in a direct or suggestive manner in Jerusalem. While nothing serious is likely to happen to you, it will draw stares and identify you as a \"tourist\" at the very least.\nOn the other hand, Tel Aviv is very liberal and gay friendly. It is common to see same-sex couples show affection in public areas. Tel Aviv was declared as the world's best gay travel destination for 2012 in a survey carried out by American Airlines and GayCities.com \u2013 for good reason: there are many gay friendly places around the city, considered a stronghold of the gay community in Israel. Tel Aviv's nights are full of hundreds of passionate, energetic pubs, bars and dance clubs that are open till dawn. The city is active in all areas of entertainment, and is highly recommended for tourists looking for exciting nightlife in general, and exciting gay nightlife in particular.\n\n\nStay healthy\nEmergency phone numbers:\n\n Ambulance Service (\"Magen David Adom\"-MADA, literally \"Red Star of David\"), \u260f 101. 24/7. The national Ambulance and pre hospital emergency medical services, including first aid and on-site treatment. Free.   (updated Oct 2023)\n Eran (\u05e2\u05e8\u05df), \u260f 1201. 24/7. Lifesaving Emotional First Aid Services, offering initial response and emotional support on the phone(including SMS and whatsapp) and online (chat, email), while maintaining strict confidentiality and anonymity. Available language include English, Russian, Amharic, Arabic, French, Spanish. Free.  (updated Oct 2023)\nThere are no special medical issues in Israel, and no immunizations are required for entry. Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended, though. Travelers to West Bank and Gaza should strongly consider getting a typhoid vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine as well.\nPharmacies and hospitals are available in all major cities and emergency and health care is to a very high Western standard. Pharmacists and all medical personnel speak adequate English. In Israeli pharmacies, the \"over-the-counter\" stuff is in fact over the counter. Ask the pharmacist if you need anything. Travel health insurance is highly recommended; although all Israelis are covered under the national health insurance system, foreigners will be expected to pay for any treatment received in the public hospitals or at a clinic.\nTap water is potable and perfectly safe for drinking all throughout Israel (but not in the West Bank or Gaza), big cities and rural parts alike. However, avoid taps that you might find within cultivated fields (e.g. while hiking); they may use recycled water which is only good for irrigation. Tap water near the Dead Sea is heavily salinated and hotels will typically provide bottles of water for guests. \nStreet food is safe and clean, including fried dishes, fish and different salads. It still is wise to use common sense and avoid anything suspicious.\nThe hot climate in Israel is a major issue, especially at summer. Use sunscreen throughout your stay and drink a lot of water. See also sunburn and sun protection.\n\n\nIn desert and rural areas\nSouthern Israel desert region offers amazing hiking trails in a beautiful landscape that possesses some unique geographical features not available anywhere else in the world. However, if you are inexperienced in hiking in the desert, do not hike there without an experienced hiker, proper equipment and clothes, plenty of water, and taking the necessary precautions. Dehydration on hot days, hypothermia on cold nights, and flash floods on rainy days are serious dangers!\n\n\nCope\n\n\nMedia\n\nIsrael has numerous newspapers, radio stations, podcasts, and magazines.\n\n\nNewspapers\nIn English:\n\n The Jerusalem Post. A daily newspaper in English, published in Israel, generally right-wing.   \n The Times of Israel. A newer Jerusalem-based online newspaper published in English, Arabic, French and Persian, that doesn't have a printed edition. Generally centrist. \nOther major Israeli newspapers that have an English language section to their websites include:\n\n Ynet (Yediot Ahronot). Non-intellectual and left-wing.   \n Israel Hayom (Israel Today). Non-intellectual and right-wing.   \n Globes. Focuses on business.   \n21 Haaretz. Intellectual and left-wing.   \nOther languages:\n\n Vesti (Russian: \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438). The most widely read Russian-language paper in Israel.   \n Makan (\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646). Arabic edition of Kan corporations. \n Panorama (\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627).   \n Al-Sinnara (\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0646\u0627\u0631\u0629).  \n Ynet Espa\u00f1ol.   \nLocal newspapers in other languages may be available where demand exists.\n\n\nRadio and TV\n Kan English news. English news by Kan.   \n Reka. Radio station broadcasts in several languages, including English (20:00), French (21:00), Spanish (22:00), Georgian (12:00), Bukhori (12:30), Amharic (13:00, 19:00), and several programs in Russian. It can be received at 100.3MHz FM, 100.5MHz FM, 101.3MHz FM, 101.8MHz FM. Programs include local culture and news.   \n i24news. an internet TV station with many broadcasts about Israel. It has an English feed, along with Arabic and French versions.   \n22 AudioVersity (formerly IDC Radio). College radio station, broadcasting Reichman University (formerly the Interdisciplinary center, IDC), Herzliya.   \nVirtually all TV stations present all TV shows in their original language, along with Hebrew subtitles (sometimes with additional Russian or Arabic subtitles). The common exceptions are shows for young kids, which are dubbed to Hebrew.\nIt is common to randomly find other Israeli radio stations broadcasting interviews and complete radio shows in English.\n\n\nEmbassies and consulates\nMost foreign embassies are situated in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, largely because the status of the capital city, Jerusalem, is disputed. Only five countries have embassies in Jerusalem: the United States, Honduras, Guatemala, Kosovo and Papua New Guinea.\nFrom a practical standpoint, consulates often offer similar services for travelers as embassies, and most first world countries have a consulate in Jerusalem in addition to their embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\n\nRespect\n\nIn general, Israelis are friendly, hospitable, and welcoming. The country as a whole has a Western-oriented outlook on life. Foreign visitors are deeply appreciated by the locals and they will do just about anything to make you feel comfortable and welcome in the country. Strangers will be more than happy to assist you, help you with anything you need, inquire about you and your background, and give you advice on anything. If you manage to make some friends here, they will do their best to take care of you here. \nThere's no way to sugarcoat it, so let's cut to the chase: yes, Israelis in general are direct communicators. This style of communication (known as 'dugriut') is a feature of the Israeli cultural ethos and can be construed as rude, abrupt, or confrontational in many parts of the world. Try not to be offended or annoyed by the way Israelis speak to you; in most cases, Israelis rarely intend to offend you in any way, shape, or form. Directness and honesty are often valued over projections of niceness.\nIsrael is an egalitarian society. Because it's a society that thrives on transparent communication, it's not uncommon for subordinates to disagree with their superiors. It's perfectly normal, and is expected. \nLoud and heated debates and arguments are socially acceptable and should not be taken as a sign of hostility. Israelis are typically careful not to be perceived as a fraier, often translated as \"sucker\", meaning someone who pays too much, stands in line quietly as others jostle past, and is generally taken advantage of instead of standing up for himself.\nIn religious settings, appropriate attitudes and prohibitions should be in order. Entry to most religious sites will be refused to those who aren't dressed appropriately (e.g. wearing shorts, short skirts, tank tops, and so on). When visiting a synagogue or the prayers section of the Western Wall, men should cover their heads. If you don't have one, a kiosk by the door of the site you are visiting may provide you with one. Mosques will also require you to take off your shoes before entry. Outside locations significant to religion, dress is very casual and free. Israeli women dress to impress.\nOn Holocaust Remembrance Day and Yom HaZikaron, sirens sound for two minutes at 10:00 and the whole country comes to a stop and stand in respect for the victims.\n\n\nSensitive issues\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict is an emotional issue for many, as is the Holocaust/Shoah, as well as much of Jewish history in general. (One should be especially respectful to the Holocaust/Shoah as many Israelis are grandchildren of survivors, and most if not all of the Ashkenazi (\"European\") Jews who make up 50% of Israel's Jewish population lost family members during the Holocaust.)\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nBy mail\n Surface and sea mail. Postcards to Europe cost \u20aa3.20. This is still an option, even though many will try to make you believe the \u20aa7.40 airmail is the only option. However, just go to the post office and demand the cheaper stamp. Be insistent and refer to the price sheet they have posted within the post office or online \u2013 there you will find the international surface mail option listed. (updated Dec 2021)\n Air mail. Postcards and letters up to weight of 100 g cost between \u20aa6.50 and \u20aa9, depending on the country of destination. (updated Dec 2021)\n\n\nBy phone\n+972 is the international country code for Israel.\nWhen calling inside Israel, you can either dial the number exactly as listed in Wikivoyage from mobiles and many landlines or replace the \"+972\" part with a single leading 0. (In the first form, you dial the number without spaces and hyphens, optionally replacing the \"+\" symbol with the international access code; when the party being called is in the same country as the caller, internationally-dialed numbers are looped back at the base station.) For example, when calling +972 2 345 6789 inside Israel, dial 02 345 6789 or +97223456789 as-is, or 0097223456789.\nThe type of call influences its price. Types can be international (with different price per each destination country in each service provider), local landline, landline - mobile, and mobile. Except for international calls, all other calls are usually priced the same, but you might find minor differences. Other than that, identifying the carrier of your call destination is irrelevant, as the allocation of dialing codes to particular companies may be inaccurate, since subscribers may keep their phone number even if leaving or changing their phone company. For example, new 050 codes are allocated by Pelephone company, but users can switch carriers and keep their 050 number even when receiving service from the Cellcom company which is usually identified with the 052 code.\nLandline area codes:\n\n0x - Area codes \u2013 the 0x area codes are used for land lines operated by the national phone company - Bezeq. Other landline operators have distinctive area codes\n02 - Jerusalem area\n03 - Tel Aviv-Yafo and the center\n04 - North\n08 - South & Shfela\n09 - Sharon\n0x2 - Paltel (Palestinian operator)\n07x - landlines operated by VoB and VoIP technologies with no distinction to a particular region. These may be assigned anywhere.\n072 - 012 Smile\n073-2/3/7 - Cellcom / Netvision\n074-7 - Partner\n076-5 - 014 Bezeq International\n077 - HOT\nInternational access codes:\n\n01x - International access codes \u2013 If you want to call abroad from Israel, you need to choose which company you want to use for your international call first.\nThe '00' and '+' access codes for international calls are available only on phone lines that chose, in advance, one of the long distance carriers as their preferred provider. It is not available on pay phones.\n011 - 011Global\n013 - Cellcom / Netvision\n014 - Bezeq International\n015 - Hallo\n017 - Hot Mobile\n018 - Xfone, a VOIP operator. Thus, it has the cheapest rate but a somewhat lower line quality.\n019 - Telzar\nCellular:\n\n05x - Cellular carriers\n050 - Pelephone (literally \"miracle phone\", the first cellular operator in Israel. \"Pelephone\" has became a generic name for cellular phone in Israel).\n052 - Cellcom\n053 - HOT mobile\n054 - Partner\n055 - MVNO (Mobile virtual network operators)\n056 - Wataniya Mobile (Palestinian operator)\n057 - Mirs. This was the old network of \"HOT mobile\". All those numbers replaced their prefix to 053 with the rest of the number unchanged. So if you try to reach an old 057 number, try dialing 053 instead.\n058 - Golan Telecom\n059 - Jawwal (Palestinian operator)\nSome Israeli numbers have only 3, 4, or 5 digits and starting with a *. To dial those numbers you actually dial the number on the phone pad, including the *. For example, the number *8787 is used by the national public transportation information call center. These * numbers work depending on your operator, with most of the numbers supported in landlines, and partial support in cellular networks. Usually when a * number is published, a longer number is mentioned somewhere in the footnotes. The longer number is also the way to dial the number when calling from a foreign international line.\n\n\nCellphone rentals and prepaid phone service\nYou can rent a cellphone for use in Israel either before your trip or once you arrive, from several firms.\nYou can also rent smartphones with SIM cards included sometimes for lower than the cost of renting just a SIM card. This offers the advantages of a SIM card rental without having to worry about bringing your own phone to Israel.\nIf you have a cellphone without a SIM-lock, you can buy a SIM-card.\nPrepaid SIM cards are available at Pelephone (Talk&Go), Cellcom (Talk Man), Partner (Bigtalk), HotMobile, Golan Telecom (GolanTalk), Rami-Levi, and 019 Telzar phone stores throughout Israel. Almost all shopping malls will have a Pelephone, Cellcom or Partner kiosk or store. Local prepaid packages valid for a month with 30G of data and 1,000 minutes of local calls should cost less than \u20aa100.\nPrepaid websites in English:\n\n Partner (bigtalk).   (updated Mar 2021)\n Golan (GolanTalk).   (updated Mar 2021)\n Hallo 015, \u260f +1 646 335 0274, toll-free: +1 800 015 015, callcenter@hallo.co.il.

(updated Mar 2021)\n\n\nRoaming with your own device\nIsrael is mostly covered with 4G and 5G. Other networks like CDMA2000 and iDen were shut down. Previous generation 2G and 3G networks have very limited coverage, and all of them are planned to be completely shut down by the end of 2024.\nIn any case, you must check with your carrier about the roaming option and the compatibility of your device in advance.\nA valid suggestion otherwise is to turn off data services, especially any automatic update/download of your email. Otherwise you might get an unpleasant surprise on your next phone bill!\nBuying a local SIM card is easy from many phone kiosks near popular tourist sites, perhaps even your hotel.\neSim is also available through SkyCall and other providers. Subscription packages in Israel can be cancelled at any time. You'd have to pay only for the relative time the subscription was active, without additional cancellation costs. There is no minimum time frame for any subsciption package.\n\n\nBy net\nCellular internet is cheaper than in countries like the US, and it is recommended to use it along with your cell phone plan.\nFree WiFi on buses and in cafes is common but not universal.\n\n\nGo next\nMany travelers take day trips or longer trips to places in Jordan, such as Petra. It is easy to get into Jordan by crossing from Eilat to Aqaba, but also the King Hussein \"Allenby\" Bridge and the Sheikh Hussein bridge are options.\nMany Israelis visit the Sinai to scuba dive, but the area can be susceptible to terrorism, so check current conditions before you go. Other areas of Egypt can also be included in combined tours with Israel.\nThe nearby island of Cyprus is also a favorite vacation spot for Israelis.",
