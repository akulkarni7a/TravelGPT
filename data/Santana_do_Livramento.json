  "extract": "Santana do Livramento, locally referred to as just Livramento, is in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It's on the border with Uruguay, right across from the Uruguayan city of Rivera. \n\n\nUnderstand\nLivramento's big attraction is its location on the border: Uruguayans come for the inexpensive goods on the Brazilian side, and Brazilians come for the duty-free shops on the Uruguayan side. Travellers from other countries can take advantage of both. Livramento also gives you the chance to stand with a foot in each country\u2014a cool photo opportunity.\nTo a large extent, Santana and Rivera function as one city: you can easily walk from one to the other without even bringing your passport. You may not even notice you're crossing the border, which is marked by inconspicuous white border markers. If you decide to venture further into the other country, though, make sure to stop at immigration (located next to Si\u00f1eriz Shopping in Rivera) to get your passport stamped out of one country and into the other.\nThat being said, they are two different cities, with separate bus systems and administration and somewhat different vibes. Being in Brazil, Santana tends to be cheaper than Rivera, has more Brazilian foods and Brazilian-style buffet restaurants, and has more Portuguese than Spanish. On both sides of the border, though, it's not uncommon to have a conversation where one side is speaking Spanish and the other Portuguese, or where both sides are speaking Portu\u00f1ol, a mixture of the two languages.\n\n\nGet in\n\nAccess is done mainly overland, as Rivera Airport no longer operates commercial flights and the closest commercial airport is Rubem Berta International Airport (URG IATA) in Uruguaiana, by 228 km from Santana do Livramento. Uruguaiana Airport also has just a handful of flights from Porto Alegre and seasonal flights from Florian\u00f3polis, which makes access by land easier than by air.\n\n\nFrom Brazil\nPorto Alegre, the state's capital, is located about 500km away, a 7h ride by bus (100-135 BRL or 30-40 USD).\n\n1 Santana do Livramento Bus Station (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Rodovi\u00e1ria de Santana do Livramento) (Rua Sen. Salgado Filho, 335), \u260f +55 55 3242-2990, contato@rodoviarialvto.com.br. (updated Nov 2021)\n\n\nFrom Uruguay\nFrom Rivera, you can just walk or drive across the border. The city is connected to other parts of Uruguay by regular bus services.\n\n2 Rivera Bus Station (Terminal de Bus de Rivera) (Calle Uruguay 551, Rivera). (updated Nov 2021)\n\n3 Brazilian and Uruguayan immigration posts (inside Shopping Si\u00f1eriz). Located in a brand new shopping mall, it has an attached duty free shop and a small food court. The location is a bit remote, so if you arrive by taxi, it might be a good idea to ask it to wait for you (metered taxi rides to Rivera bus station cost 90 UYU or 3 USD), but you can also ask the shopping security guard to order one for you. Brazilian passport holders are not supposed to get Brazilian stamps in their passports, but in this border it occasionally happens. \n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n1 Pra\u00e7a Internacional (Parque Internacional de la Amistad). Put one foot in Brazil and one foot in Uruguay. Has some mom-and-pop shops with crafts that make nice souvenirs.  (updated Aug 2017)\n\n\nDo\n\n\nBuy\nLots of inexpensive stores catering to Uruguayans are located in the area near the border and the Pra\u00e7a Internacional. There are also lots of duty-free shops on the Uruguayan side.\nPrices tend to be listed in reais in Livramento and in pesos in Rivera, but stores on both sides are happy to accept either currency. Currency exchange places, as well as lots of stands selling contraband, can be found on the border near the Pra\u00e7a Internacional. The unlicensed currency exchange stands right on the border offer very good rates, better than the official exchange places nearby. They accept US dollars as well as pesos and reais.\n\n\nEat\n1 Coisa Nossa, Av. Tamandar\u00e9 1758, \u260f +55 55 3242-1160. Brazilian-style buffet: serve yourself from an extensive selection of fruits, vegetables, and more, then choose from various types of meat that the servers bring around to your table. (updated Aug 2017)\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\nCheaper hotels are available here than in Rivera.\n\n1 Verde Plaza Hotel, Manduca Rodrigues, 747 (+55 55 3242-9300), reservas@verdeplaza.com.br. (updated Aug 2017)\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nCope\n\n\nConsulates\n 1 Uruguay, Av. Tamandar\u00e9 2101, \u260f +55 55 3242-1416, cdlivramento@mrree.gub.uy.
