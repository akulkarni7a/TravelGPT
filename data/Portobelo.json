  "extract": "Portobelo is a port city in Central Panama. It is located on the northern part of the Isthmus of Panama.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nPortobelo was founded in 1597 by Spanish explorer Francisco Velarde y Mercado. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries it was an important silver-exporting port in New Granada on the Spanish Main and one of the ports on the route of the Spanish treasure fleets.\nThe city was also a victim of one of Captain Henry Morgan's notorious adventures. In 1668, Morgan led a fleet of privateers and 450 men against Portobelo, which, in spite of its good fortifications, he captured and plundered for 14 days, stripping it of nearly all its wealth. This daring endeavour, although successful, also proved particularly brutal as it involved rape, torture, and murder on a grand scale.\nOn November 21, 1739, the port was again attacked and captured by a British fleet, commanded this time by Admiral Edward Vernon during the War of Jenkins' Ear. The British victory created an outburst of popular acclaim throughout the British Empire, and many streets and settlements in the British Isles and the Thirteen Colonies were named Portobello such as Portobello Road in London.\nHowever, the town was quickly recovered by the Spanish and Admiral Vernon suffered a major defeat against the stronghold of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. Vernon was forced to return to England with a decimated fleet and over 18,000 casualties. Despite the Portobelo campaign, British efforts of gaining a foothold in the Spanish Main and disrupting the galleon trade were fruitless. Following the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Spanish switched from large fleets calling at few ports to small fleets trading at a wide variety of ports. They also began to travel around Cape Horn to trade on the West coast.\nToday, Portobelo is a sleepy city with a population of fewer than 3,000. It has a deep natural harbor and is home to many cruising yachts. In 1980 the ruins of the fortification, along with nearby Fort San Lorenzo, were declared a World Heritage Site.\nWhen Francis Drake died of dysentery in 1596 at sea, he was buried in a lead coffin near Portobelo bay. They're still looking for him. There are two dive centers operating here. It is also a place to book passages on boats to Colombia.\nThe fortifications and about 36,000 hectares of surrounding tropical rainforest are protected areas that are part of the Portobelo National Park (part of the Panama national parks system).\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nVisitors could drive from Panama City to Portobelo, taking the Transisthmian highway (Auto Pista) to Sabanitas and then turn right on the road that leads to Portobelo. It takes around one and a half-hour.\n\n\nBy bus\nBy bus from Panama City Albrooke terminal, take the Colon Express (45 min, $3.15) and get off at the Rey supermarket in Sabanitas. There switch to the Portobelo bus (1 hr, $1.30). The Portobelo bus can be caught by the front entrance of the Rey supermarket around the corner.\nBuses depart Portobelo every half hour from 04:30 to 18:00 making many stops along the way to Sabanitas (Rey Supermarket) (1 hr, $1.30) en route to Colon (total 1\u00bd hr, $1.35). In Sabanitas, cross the highway on the pedestrian bridge and catch the Panama City Express bus (1 hr, $3.15). To guarantee a seat on the Panama bus, continue on to Colon and catch it there (1\u00bd hr, $3.15).\n\n\nBy boat\nThere are now over 30 vessels operating the route between Portobelo, San Blas, and Colombia. They vary widely in safety, comfort, and price ($475-700) depending on the boat. A person would be ill advised to book an 180-nautical-mile ocean passage (333 km) on a vessel he hasn\u2019t inspected with a captain he hasn\u2019t met. The waters between San Blas and Colombia can be challenging at times. Don\u2019t depend on second hand information. Vessels depart regularly from Portobelo, Puerto Lindo, and Porvenir. Make an informed decision.\n\n\nGet around\n\nPortobelo is very small and easy to navigate. There's one road which runs parallel to the water which forks just before the village square. Take the left fork for immigration and Internet cafe, and the right fork for more food places.\n\n\nSee\nYou can see the sights in Portobelo in an hour. Start at the west end fort ruin. From there head east on the left hand side of the road and you'll see a staircase up to the watch tower with great views of the bay.\nOn your way to the eastern side stop off at the Church and Old Customs house.\n\n\nDo\nTour the forts, Custom House, and museum.\nTake a launch to local beaches: Playa Blanca, Playa Frances.\nRent a kayak.\nHorseback riding.\nAnfibia board: Go anfibia boarding and feel what's like to swim free like a dolphin!

They leave from in front of the church, but you can flag them down anywhere along the main road.\nA cheap taxi boat service (langcha in Spanish) opened in November 2016, running weekly from Portobelo to Capurgana (a village on the Colombian side of the border, where you get a second langcha to the major city named Turbo). The ride is $160 per person and the langcha is named Naturalstour and is about 400 meters before the entrance of Porotobelo when arriving from the city of Colon.\nRegular boats leave to Cartagenia for around $300-500. Captain Jack is selling tours for $550. You may all ask your hostel for info.\nIf you are lucky, you can also find cheapest passage on boats from Portobelo to Kuna Yala (around 100 km) for around $70 (specify that you need only the transport, no lunch or other amenities). Ask as always in Captain Jack or in local hostel/tour operator.\nRemember that the only other way to reach Kuna Yala is come back to Panama City and do another 23-3 hr driving on sickness road.",
