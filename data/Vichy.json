  "extract": "Vichy is a town in Auvergne. It's known for two things: its spas (Vichy is one of eleven world heritage-listed European spa towns), and as the headquarters of the pro-Nazi Vichy regime during the Second World War.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nVichy is a town in the department of Allier, in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, in France.\nThe town is near the centre of France, at the foothills of the Massif Central. \n\n1 Tourist and Spa Office (Office de Tourisme et de Thermalisme), 19 rue du Parc (follow the signs (Palais des Congr\u00e8s-Op\u00e9ra/Tourist Office) from the arrival in the city centre), \u260f +33 825 77 10 10, toll-free: +33 4 70 98 71 94.

Accessible, without assistance, to people with reduced mobility. Guided tours around the history and heritage of the city. (updated Oct 2019)\n\n\nHistory\nThe 1860s were a rich period for Vichy, thanks to the stays of Napoleon III which allowed the creation of parks, thermal roads and the arrival of the railway. The tourist activity reached a national notoriety until the beginnings of the First World War then in the interwar period. It is also known for having been the seat of government of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain from 1940 to 1944.\nAfter decolonization, the projects carried out by the last four mayors (Pierre Coulon from 1950 to 1967, then Jacques Lacarin until 1989, Claude Malhuret from 1989 to 2017 and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Aguilera since 2017) made it possible to modernize the city, in value from the city centre to the banks of Allier.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nThe town is accessible by several roads:\n\nA71 and A719 motorways to Montlu\u00e7on and Clermont-Ferrand\nDepartmental road D 2209 from Gannat or Varennes-sur-Allier\nDepartmental road D 1093 from Bellerive-sur-Allier, Randan or Clermont-Ferrand\nDepartmental road D 906 E from Abrest, Saint-Yorre, Thiers, Le Puy-en-Velay\nDepartmental road D 6 from Saint-Pour\u00e7ain-sur-Sioule\n\n\nBy train\n1 Gare de Vichy Station Square (follow signs \"Train station\" from the bridge of Bellerive Cusset or the northern districts). M-Sa 05:30-22:50, Su 08:20-22:50. Accessible, without assistance, to people with reduced mobility except access to the platform leading to track D. Wirelessfree. Presence of at least one elevator from the hall or from behind the station to the underpass or the platform to tracks B and C. \u200bThe service is provided by trains with compulsory reservation in the direction of Paris (2 hr 55 min) and TERAuvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes in the direction of Lyon (about 2 hours), Clermont-Ferrand (30 min) or even Moulins (35 min).  (updated Oct 2019)\nThe duration of a train journey is better than by road; Vichy and Clermont-Ferrand are linked in 31  minutes with an intermediate stop in Riom and more rarely another stop in Gerzat, which is only indicated by the TER.\n\n\nBy coach\n2 Bus station (Gare routi\u00e8re) (access from rue Voltaire or rue du Mar\u00e9chal Joffre, south of the train station), \u260f +33 4 70 98 41 33. the bus station has been the connecting and departure point for regional or departmental coaches. A place, however, poorly marked. The timetables for the next regional coaches are displayed on the Main Line departure screens, those for departmental coaches at the Kiosk when it is open or at the main and south exits. (updated Oct 2019)\nPossible destinations:\n\nregional coaches: Montlu\u00e7on, Saint-Germain-des-Foss\u00e9s, Thiers, Ambert\ndepartmental coaches: Gannat, Chantelle, Le Mayet-de-Montagne, Maringues\n\n\nBy car\nThe city has long been isolated from the main roads. The nearest motorway, the A719, is over 3 miles from the city centre.\nZones 30 cover an acceptable perimeter in the city centre, between rue de Paris, rue Georges-Clemenceau and avenue Doumer, as well as on certain streets outside the city centre (main street and not mesh streets!) There are only two meeting areas, where pedestrians have priority over other users: on an access to a car park in the east of the city near the urban boulevard (since 2013) and on the back alley of the boulevard du Mar\u00e9chal-de-Lattre-de-Tassigny (since 2014).\nNot all places in the municipality are always correctly marked. Hotel signage is shown in yellow on dark brown signs and notable restaurants in white on the same signs.\n\n\nParking\nA paid parking zone - there is no entry or exit sign for a paid parking zone (except on Quai d'Allier) - covers the city centre, from the Parc des Sources to Vieux Vichy and the SNCF train station: places are paid from Monday to Saturday from 09:00 to 12:00 and from 14:00 to 18:00 (free on Sundays and public holidays), within the limit of 3 or 7 hours depending on the zone. The first twenty minutes have been free since 2018 in these areas.\nParking is prohibited in line with the traffic signs on the side indicated and by two continuous yellow lines drawn on the ground (non-regulatory marking).\nThere are four underground paid car parks (the number of spaces available is displayed at four city entrances. Look for signs directing you to them.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nUrban transport\n MobiVie public transit. M-Sa 18:20-20:00; Sundays and holidays: 10:00-12:00 and  14:00-  19:10. Urban transport network serving Vichy and five towns in the agglomeration (Abrest, Bellerive-sur-Allier, Creuzier-le-Vieux, Cusset and Hauterive). \u20ac1.25 per trip (if bought in a bus) \u20ac3.4 per 24  hr - depending on buses and stops..   (updated Sep 2019)\nThe bus network is made up of eight lines. Line A goes from the Ailes district to the city centre, to the train station and to Cusset with a bus every 20 minutes (and is operated by electric buses). Lines B and C serve the city centre, the station and the hospital, with a bus every twenty minutes; line B continues to Bellerive-sur-Allier and line C to Cusset or the aquatic stadium. Line D, north-south, serves the market and the media library. Line E goes around the parks, but with irregular frequency. Only lines A and B run on Sundays and public holidays.\nThe information available to travellers is provided on almost all the stops. It is not always kept up to date: at certain stops, it is partially obsolete, or even non-existent (responsibility for the agglomeration).\n\n\nBy bike\nCyclists are particularly vulnerable. If you cycle in Vichy, you must exercise extreme vigilance. There are, however, some cycling facilities, in particular along the Esplanade du Lac d'Allier, on the Quai d'Allier, and the paths along the River Allier on the Napol\u00e9on-III and Kennedy parks, or along the 'All\u00e9e des Ailes or on the Pont de l'Europe.\nThe department of Allier has marked out cycle routes (towards Cusset, Lapalisse, Saint-Pour\u00e7ain-sur-Sioule, Randan by SNCF bridge over the Allier or by the left bank). Partly using busy lanes, it is the cyclists' responsibility to be careful.\nIn this city, zones 30 have the major drawback, on one-way roads, of being closed to reverse traffic, for obscure safety reasons (with the one and only exception of avenue de Gramont between boulevard Gambetta and rue de la Gare). A simple forbidden direction in zone 30 does not allow you to go up a street and requires you to take a detour.\nA bicycle rental service is available in summer:\n\n3 Vichy Rosalie (shortly before the Bellerive bridge). Only in season.  Rental of four-wheeled bicycles. (updated Jun 2021)\nIt is possible, provided you use an app, to borrow one of the city's free-service bikes, a rental service for classic or electric bikes.
