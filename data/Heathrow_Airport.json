  "extract": "Heathrow Airport (LHR  IATA) is the main airport for London, the largest airport in the United Kingdom, and the second busiest in the world in terms of international passenger traffic. It is in the west of London, 17 miles (27 km) from central London. It is the primary hub for the UK's flag carrier, British Airways, and for the airline founded by Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nLondon Heathrow is a giant, sprawling airport divided into four passenger terminals (numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5). Terminal 2 is also called \"The Queen's Terminal\". Terminal 1 was closed permanently in June 2015. The airport was established in the late 1940s, and is London's primary airport and the premier air gateway into the United Kingdom. It is also the second busiest airport in the world for international passenger traffic and Europe's foremost hub airport.\nDue to its size, increased security requirements and the fact that development had not kept pace with its growth, Heathrow has become overcrowded and has developed a reputation for long queues, inefficiency and delays. It has only two runways although its traffic is more typical of airports with four or more, so delays are common, particularly during inclement weather. \nHeathrow does not have good snow clearing facilities, and the airport often has to be shut down during snowstorms in the winter.\n\n\nBaggage security checks\nDetails for the United Kingdom can be found at the Security Control section of the official Heathrow Airport website.\n\n\nWatch\n\nAs the most well-known airport in the UK, Heathrow appears in a large number of films, but rarely in a starring role.\n\nAirport (BBC, 1996-2008). Fly-on-the-wall style documentary series following life at the airport through the eyes of several staff from various different parts of the airport. Running for many years, the series, and some of the staff it followed, became something of an institution.\nHeathrow: Britain's Busiest Airport (ITV, 2015). Documentary series about the complex day-to-day operation of the airport, including areas you may not think of like the wittily-named ARC (Animal Reception Center).\nUK Border Force (Sky, 2008-2009). Documentary series about the UK border agency. Much of the show is centred around border agents scrutinising travellers, ensuring they have entered the country legitimately and not for the purposes of fraud or smuggling.\n\n\nFlights\n\nMake sure you double-check which terminal you need to use on the Heathrow Airport website as the allocation of airlines or certain flights may change. As of 2024, Heathrow's four passenger terminals have been assigned as follows with not all airlines depicted:\n\n\nConnecting flights\nPassengers connecting between two international flights, or from a domestic to an international flight need not pass through customs and immigration if your baggage has been tagged through to your next destination; just follow the signs to \"Flight Connections\" after exiting the aircraft. However, be sure to have printed copy of your itinerary, or a boarding pass for your next flight in hand, as you will need to present it to security before you can proceed into the airside area of the departure hall.\nIf you are connecting from an international flight to a domestic flight, follow the signs for \"Flight Connections\", but you will need to pass through immigration before proceeding into the departure hall. However, if your bag has been tagged through to your next destination, you do not need to collect your bags, and you will instead clear customs at your final destination.\n\n\nGround transportation\n\n\nBy car\nThe airport is some 17 miles (27 km) west of central London. A large part of the journey can be made by means of the M4 motorway, which can, however, be quite congested at peak periods. Terminal 5 can be reached directly from junction 14 of the M25. The airport is also near the M40 and M3.\nThe car rental depots are all concentrated along the northern periphery of the airport, and free shuttle buses are available from all terminals.  There can be time delays when arriving at the hire desk with large queues so make every effort to get to the desk before the crowd, perhaps by getting one member of the party with hand luggage to go straight through. You may find at early morning or late evening that the arrivals hall desk is closed and you have to go straight onto the shuttle bus and check out your rental at the depot instead.\nIf you are intending to drive into the centre of London you will be liable for the Congestion Charge, which is \u00a311.50 per day and applies on Monday-Friday 7AM-6PM.  Automatic number plate recognition cameras are in operation, and your car rental company will track you down and bill you with the hefty fine if you fail to pay.\n\n\nParking your car\n\nDifferent car parks have different procedures.\nThere is no shortage of choice when parking your car at Heathrow but there are many procedures to follow depending on which car park you choose. Some simply get you to turn up and report to a reception area which is easy enough. However some others have different procedures such as using the credit card you used to pre book with to enter the car park or even registration plate recognition.\nThere is also a massive difference in the prices charged by many car parks in and around Heathrow. For example, you can find individual house owners in the vicinity of the airport who are happy to rent you a space outside their house for a week or two and it\u2019s usually very cheap in comparison to the large car park operators; however, this is definitely a case of \"buyer beware\"!\nOf course, there is no security at these spaces \u2013 you get what you pay for to some extent \u2013 plus you often find that you are left to your own devices to get to the airport. This could mean public transport if you\u2019re lucky, but more often than not, it means getting a taxi both there and back. This usually results in negating any of the cost savings you have made in the parking itself.\n\n\nPublic transport to and from London\n\nAll the terminals have very good public transport links to and from central London, with options ranging from local and express buses to the London Underground and rail services. The majority of travellers heading to central London use public transport as it the easiest way to go. Note that there are different rail stations for the five terminals at Heathrow - be sure you take the right train as not all trains go to the same terminals. You can usually check the front of the train or listen to the on-board announcements for an idea of where the train is going. There are no longer off peak fares when travelling by train or tube between Heathrow and zone 1.\n\n\nBy train\n\n Heathrow Express. 05:33-23:48 (Terminals 2 & 3). The fastest way to central London is also by far the most expensive. The Heathrow Express departs from Terminal 5 every 15 minutes, stops at Terminals 2 & 3, and then runs non-stop in 15 min. to Paddington Station where connections are available to the rest of London\u2019s transport system. New Class 387 Heathrow Express trains introduced in 2021 are air-conditioned, modern, comfortable and are fully accessible with a wheelchair area, disabled toilet and level access to the station platforms. Free Wi-Fi Internet access is available on board. Mobile phone coverage is available throughout the entire route, including in the tunnels under Heathrow. On board TV entertainment plays throughout the journey, offering news bulletins, destination information, comedy clips and trivia. Quiet zones are available where this does not play. There are two classes of accommodation - Express (Standard) Class and First Class. First Class offers a larger seat, more legroom (though there\u2019s plenty in Express Class), tables and complimentary newspapers. The First Class area of the train also stops closer to the station exits. Since the journey is only about 15 minutes long either way, the First Class area is something of a real luxury and really only for those with money to burn. Fares can be purchased in advance on the internet, from the station or on board the train and they vary in price depending on where you bought them. National Railcard discounts are available at Heathrow Express station ticket offices only (with the exception of Disabled Persons Railcard, which can be used on-board). Child fares (5\u201315 years inclusive) are about half the adult fare. Under 5s travel free. If you book your ticket online you can have it sent to you as an email message to print out or as a mobile phone picture message, both contain a barcode and the conductor scans this on the train. Prebooking can go as low as \u00a310. Walk-up rates are notorious in comparison: Single: any time \u00a325, on-board \u00a327; Return: \u00a337. reduced fares available when booking online (as low as \u00a35.50, more details here). Oyster Cards are valid, any time \u00a325.   (updated Dec 2022)\n Elizabeth line. Formerly known as TfL Rail and Heathrow Connect, the Elizabeth line follows the same route to London Paddington as the Heathrow Express but is a slower, less frequent train which also serves intermediate local stations in West London. The Elizabeth line provides a convenient connection to the London Underground\u2019s Central line at Ealing Broadway station. Trains depart Terminal 5 for London Paddington every 30 minutes; after Terminals 2 & 3, the Elizabeth line stops at Hayes & Harlington, Southall, Hanwell, West Ealing and Ealing Broadway. The journey time from Terminal 3 to London Paddington is 28 min. From Paddington, trains continue onto stations in the West End, City of London, Canary Wharf and East London. The new Class 345 trains on the Elizabeth line feature accessible seating, luggage bays and Wi-Fi on board. To London Paddington: adult single \u00a311.60 (anytime) via Oyster Card or contactless; to Hayes & Harlington \u00a36.70 peak/\u00a36.40 off-peak.   (updated Dec 2023)\n South Western Railway (bus link from Terminals 2 & 3, bus 285, and Terminals 4 & 5, bus 490, to Feltham railway station.). Trains every 20 minutes. Although a slower route, if you are heading for south London or the west London suburbs, Richmond or Windsor, this could prove a useful shortcut. Regular bus services run from the airport to Feltham station (single fare \u00a31.30 on Oyster) and a frequent east-west rail line runs between Reading and London Waterloo (single fare \u00a35). Depending on the route, some trains take 30 minutes (trains via Richmond), others take 45 minutes (trains via Hounslow and Kew), so it is advised to check the train times carefully if you are rushing to catch a plane. You must buy your train ticket before boarding as this is not an airport express train but a standard suburban rail service. You can use Oyster cards valid for zone 6 to use the train and bus on this route.   \n\n\nBy Tube\nLondon Underground\u2019s Piccadilly line direct to central London. Up to every 5 minutes (depending on the terminal). Oyster cards are valid.\nThe tube entrance is poorly signposted and actually on the opposite side of the terminal from the train entrance. At the train entrance, you will not find anything, neither tickets nor wagons for the tube.\nThe Piccadilly line runs directly from all the terminals to the very centre of London, stopping at stations close to many of London\u2019s landmarks, shopping and entertainment areas, as well as the major transport hub at King\u2019s Cross St. Pancras. However, the small, cramped Tube carriages have no luggage space to speak of and many central London stations that are deep underground have yet to install step-free access, making the Piccadilly line far from ideal for travellers with lots of luggage. The line also has a large number of stops and is comparatively slow (60 minutes from Terminal 5 to King\u2019s Cross St. Pancras at the far end of central London, vs 45 minutes using the Heathrow Express and changing to the Tube at Paddington). Nonetheless, it is an integral part of Transport for London\u2019s network so Travelcards, Oyster cards, and Contactless credit or debit cards are valid, making it a good value option. It\u2019s also a better option if you want to get to much of west London instead of having to go into Paddington and then back out again.\nTrains depart Terminals 4 & 5 every 10 minutes and stop at Terminals 2 & 3 before continuing to London, thus making the frequency from Terminals 2 & 3 every 5 minutes. Trains to and from Terminal 5 do not stop at Terminal 4 and trains to and from Terminal 4 do not stop at Terminal 5. Be aware that if you are heading from central London to Terminals 2 & 3 then it is normally quicker to wait for a train which terminates at Terminal 5 as the trains to Terminal 4 wait there for up to 7 minutes before continuing to Terminals 2 & 3. Terminal 5 trains go directly to Terminals 2 & 3 first, then continue to Terminal 5. The Tube closes during the night for maintenance work and the first trains leave Heathrow at about 06:00. Last trains are around 00:00, but check beforehand!\nDuring peak rush hour periods the Tube becomes extremely overcrowded, particularly in the central zones. Trains designated for Heathrow are sometimes rerouted down the Rayners Lane branch or terminate short at Acton Town or Northfields to deal with peak-hour congestion - the driver will normally make an announcement if this is going to happen. If you are using the Tube to travel to Heathrow during rush hour, ensure that you leave central London in plenty of time. Also, try to join the train as far up the line as possible - King's Cross St Pancras is a good bet - since you will stand a much better chance of finding a seat and somewhere to put your luggage. Also, if you are going to T4 or T5 and a train to the other terminal comes along and it looks like it has space, it can be a good bet to get on that train, then get off at Hatton Cross station (just before Heathrow) and wait until the right train comes along, since in central London the train you actually want may be very crowded.\nAs the Tube is a rapid transport system designed with short journeys in mind, the trains are not as comfortable as a mainline train. However, from Heathrow there will almost always be seats available and luggage space is provided. There is space for wheelchairs and the Heathrow stations are accessible, but as the first parts of the Tube system were built in the 19th century, very few stations in central London are accessible to wheelchairs. Almost all involve negotiating staircases and escalators. Earls Court is an exception and some other stations can be reached by wheelchair users by changing to alternative lines here. More stations are being adapted (King\u2019s Cross St. Pancras is now accessible, for instance) and accessible stations are shown on the Tube Map available on TfL\u2019s website. Audio and visual journey information is usually provided on board.\nTicketing: The Tube is a closed system and nearly all stations have ticket barriers. Penalty fares are in force for those caught without a valid ticket for the zones they are travelling through. An example fare for travel from Zone 6 (the zone the airport is in) to Zone 1 (central London, including King's Cross St. Pancras) is:\n\nIf you travel Off Peak (other than Monday to Friday from 0630 to 0930 and from 1600 to 1900) and really want to save a few pound, travel from any airport terminal to Hatton Cross tap out, you will not be charged on your Oyster/Contactless for the journal as you are travelling within the Heathrow free travel zone, you can then immediately tap in and travel to your destination from Hatton Cross (Zone 5), for example, you will be charged \u00a33.50 on your Oyster/Contactless for the journal from Zone 5 (the zone the Hatton Cross is in) to Zone 1 (central London, including King's Cross St. Pancras).\nTravelcards (day, or period tickets which allow unlimited travel on all of London\u2019s public transport, not just the Tube) are available and will almost certainly provide better value if you plan on using London\u2019s transport system more than a couple of times. The cheapest option for anyone spending a longer time in London will probably be to get an Oyster card (a Transport for London travel smartcard) or to use a Contactless credit or debit card, which is always cheaper and easier than paying fares in cash. However, the Oyster card can only be returned (including getting back your deposit) after 25 hr or more of purchase. Also, your card amount is not allowed to be above \u00a310, otherwise you need to register online to return the card. See the London article and Transport for London\u2019s website for more information on Oyster cards and other available fares. If you both enter and exit the paid area at one of the terminal stations, you will not be charged anything.\n\n\nBy coach\n National Express coach (direct to London Victoria Coach Station). approx. 07:00-23:30. A direct coach service from Heathrow Central Bus Station to London Victoria Coach Station every 30 min. Journey times are 40-50 min. Tickets can be bought from the National Express ticket office at Heathrow Bus station or on the Internet. Some services operate via Terminals 4 & 5, but the service is more limited. Free transfer is available to Terminals 2 & 3 and the Central Bus Station from Terminals 4 & 5 via the Heathrow Express and Connect trains or the shuttle bus services. All coaches are accessible to wheelchairs. to London Victoria Coach Station from \u00a36; transfer to Gatwick Airport \u00a320; London Travel cards and Oyster Cards are not valid. (updated Nov 2015)\n\n\nBy bus\nDay time local buses to the areas surrounding Heathrow.\nIn the day time there are no local bus services to central London (that service is provided by the Tube), but there are plenty of services to areas of west London and outlying towns such as Slough and Maidenhead. Heathrow Airport have a map and journey planners on their website showing the routes available.\nFares vary depending on the operator, but Transport for London services (red buses) are subject to the standard flat fare when paying by cash (Travelcards and Oyster Cards are also valid on these buses).\nIf you really want to go by local bus during the day from central London (perhaps you have a bus pass not valid on trains or coaches), expect a journey time of about three hours, depending on exactly where you start from. If you're intrepid, use the TfL journey planner to find details, times and (most importantly) where to change buses, which you may end up doing three or four times depending on where you start from and when you travel.\nN9 Regular late night London Bus Service.\nDuring the night, when most of the rail and coach links (and the flights!) have stopped operating, one of the few ways you can get to and from Heathrow is by using the N9 night bus service, which operates to and from Aldwych in central London via Hammersmith.\nThe service runs every 20 minutes on weeknights and takes around 1 hour and 10 minutes to Heathrow Central Bus Station and continues to Terminal 5. The service is operated using modern, accessible, low-floor busses with a wheelchair space.\nThe N9 is a normal Transport for London Night Bus service and so is subject to a flat cash fare of \u00a32.00. All Travelcards and Oyster Cards are valid on London Bus services.\n\n\nBy taxi\nBlack cabs - London\u2019s famous black taxis - are available for hire outside each terminal. Journey time into Central London varies wildly depending on distance, time of day and traffic conditions. It can take anything from 40 minutes to 2 hours. Fares vary similarly, as a rough guide it could cost about \u00a355 to Central London.\nMinicabs (private hire cars) must be ordered in advance by phone (or the Internet in some cases) and usually cost less than a black cab. Never take a minicab if you haven't pre-booked it, because then it's just a stranger's car.\nPre-booked airport transfers \u2013 Private hire services must be pre-booked and often cost less than black cabs. Options like Heathrow Airport Pickups provide pre-booked services directly to and from Heathrow terminals, offering fixed rates and a meet-and-greet option. For more details on these services, consider searching for airport-specific providers online.\nIf you are thinking of taking a taxi into London then consider the Heathrow Express (you can pick up a taxi at Paddington station to complete your journey). They will probably be faster, cheaper, and almost as easy to use.\n\n\nPublic transport to the rest of the UK\n\n\nBy coach\n\n National Express. Operate direct coach services from Heathrow to many cities around the UK, as well as direct links to all of the other London airports. Most coaches serve Terminal 5 and the Central Bus Station, some stop at Terminal 4. You should give careful consideration as to whether National Express is the right means for you compared to rail, as there is a three-way tradeoff between price, speed and convenience in play. (updated Nov 2015)\nOne significant benefit of National Express' service is that they have a generous luggage allowance, dedicated holds for the same on their coaches and direct routes from all three terminals, meaning that while National Express may be slower than the train (often by hours) it is also significantly less hassle and usually a lot cheaper into the bargain - especially if booked in advance. You are also guaranteed a seat, as unlike rail (where unlimited tickets can be sold for a given journey and you may be expected to stand if you can't find an open seat) National Express will not sell more tickets than they have seats available, and these seats are usually comfortable and relatively roomy. Given that rail journeys will often involve multiple changes onto services that may have limited luggage storage space, and journeys on the London Underground, which is often absolutely ram packed and has absolutely no luggage storage whatsoever, this makes National Express arguably the easiest and most comfortable means of getting to Heathrow from around the country with anything other than a carry-on bag.\nThe downside is that the coaches run, obviously, on normal roads and will stop at any number of small towns on the way to their final destinations - any delay (particularly on the notoriously traffic jam-prone M25 orbital motorway around London) can therefore be catastrophic if you have a tight connection, and the journey will be a lot slower and more circuitous than any on rail. National Express also offer limited to no compensation in the event of delays (whereas the railways have a regulated delay repay scheme and a legal duty of care to get you to your destination no matter what, even by taxi if need be - albeit not in any particular timescale) and their customer service is often dubious at best.\nAdditionally, while some National Express services stop at well-lit, staffed and pleasant central bus stations or even dedicated coach terminals (e.g. Norwich's modern central bus station or Southampton's dedicated National Express terminal in the city centre), many if not most pick up and drop off points will be at normal roadside municipal bus stops which may or may not have seating or even a shelter, and will have no direct contact point with National Express if anything goes wrong. This compares unfavourably to rail, where stations almost invariably are well lit, have seating, have shelters (if not heated and lit waiting rooms), often have manned ticket offices to provide assistance and are covered by CCTV.\n\n The Airline. Oxford Bus operate a 24 hour frequent (every 20 minutes during the day) coach shuttle service to and from Oxford. Adult: single \u00a323, day return \u00a324, period return \u00a329. (updated Nov 2015)\nConnections with trains:\n\n RailAir (Central Bus Station (Terminals 2 & 3), Terminal 5, Reading station), \u260f +44 118 957-9425. First runs express coach between Heathrow Central Bus Station and the Reading railway station to connect with train services. Adult single \u00a320 (advance online or via iOS and Android app \u00a317). (updated Nov 2015)\n Green Line's #724 (to Watford Junction for trains to the Midlands, Manchester, Liverpool, NW England and Scotland), \u260f +44 844 801 7261. (updated Nov 2015)\n National Express coaches (to Woking station for trains to Aldershot, Winchester, Salisbury, Portsmouth, Southampton and Bournemouth). (updated Nov 2015)\n Bus #285 (to Feltham for trains to Richmond, Camberley, Bracknell, London Waterloo, Clapham Junction and the South), \u260f +44 20 7222-1234. Single under \u00a35. (updated Nov 2015)\n Bus #490 (from Terminal 5 to Richmond via Terminal 4, Hatton Cross and Feltham station.), \u260f +44 20 7222-1234. Single under \u00a35. (updated Nov 2015)\n\n\nBy train\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain\nHeathrow does not yet have any direct rail services to anywhere outside of London, meaning that you will have to go into the centre of the city and then come back out again, but making a connection in one of the central London railway stations is fairly easy.\nThrough tickets are available to & from Heathrow Airport from any station in the UK, using either the Tube network, Heathrow Express or Connect from central London or the RailAir coach links. If you want to use the Heathrow Express it\u2019ll probably be cheaper to buy your ticket for it separately. Make sure you specify the method you want to use to reach Heathrow when you buy your rail ticket.\nAll of the major railway stations are also on the Tube network, making cross-London connections from Paddington fairly straightforward. Below is a quick summary of the principal connections available:\n\nPaddington: (by Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect) For Oxford, Bath, Bristol, Penzance, Cardiff, Swansea and the overnight sleeper to Cornwall.\nEuston: (Tube - Circle line: Euston Square then walk 200m) For Birmingham (New Street), Manchester, Liverpool, the Lake District, Glasgow and overnight sleepers to Scotland.\nLiverpool Street (Tube - Circle line  CIR ) For Cambridge, Stansted Airport, Norwich and the Essex coast.\nMarylebone: (Tube - Bakerloo line  BAK ) For Birmingham (Snow Hill) - slower than the main route from Euston but can be cheaper.\nSt Pancras: (Tube - Circle line  CIR ) For Luton Airport, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Sheffield, high-speed services to Kent - and Eurostar services to Paris and Brussels\nKing's Cross: (Tube - Circle line  CIR ) For Cambridge, York, Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and daytime trains to Inverness, Dundee and Aberdeen.\nVictoria (Tube - Circle line  CIR ) For Brighton and Gatwick Airport.\nIf you plan on travelling on the Great Western line to the South West of England or South Wales then another option is to take the local U3 bus from the Central Bus Station to West Drayton railway station. The bus takes around 20 minutes to complete this journey when there is no traffic. From there take a local train to Reading railway station in order to connect to other services. The benefit of this route is that you are buying a normal railway ticket, as opposed to one that has a premium attached for a journey starting or ending at Heathrow.\nFor information, time and fares for trains to & from Heathrow Airport check the National Rail Enquires website.\nSee By coach sub-section for connections via coach services.\n\n\nBy taxi\nThere are many airport transfer services that provide personal transport services to Heathrow Airport. All transport companies that operate transfer services must be licensed with the relevant local authority. Drivers are issued a badge after undergoing various checks and vehicles are issued licenses confirming that they have passed rigorous safety checks and have the correct insurance in place. Drivers and vehicles are licensed as either Hackney Carriages or Private Hire, each one is covered by different regulations. When booking an airport transfer you should always check that the company has a license from the council. This is particularly important when booking over the internet or over the phone. Booking directly with a taxi company rather than with an online booking agency will usually be more cost effective.\n\n\nGet around\n\nAs it's such a difficult to understand and constantly changing place, Heathrow has a significant internal transport system so people can get around. All travel within the airport boundary on Heathrow Express & Connect trains is free:\n\nThe Central Terminal Area houses Terminal 2, Terminal 3, and the Central Bus Station, which are all within walking distance, linked by underground tunnels with travelators. The Central Terminal Area is in the middle of the airport between the runways; Terminal 4 is in the south-eastern corner of the airport, beyond the southern runway; and Terminal 5 is in the far west of the airport, between the runways.\nTo get from the Central Terminal Area to Terminal 4 you can take the free shuttle train (every 15 min, journey ~20 min) or Tube (free only with Oyster card).\nTo get from the Central Terminal Area to Terminal 5 you can take the free Heathrow Express train (every 15 min, journey ~20 min) or Tube (free only with Oyster card).\nTo transfer between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 you can either take buses (#482 or #490, \u00a31.75, journey ~20 min) or take the train or Tube to the Central Terminal Area and change.\nTo reach Terminal 5 from the car parks, there is a free, automated personal rapid transit (PRT) system called Heathrow Pod which provides a quick shuttle to/from Terminal 5.\nIf you are connecting to another flight airside there is a network of free buses that will take you between terminals (if you need to change terminal).\nTo reach the satellite buildings within Terminal 5, there is a free airside automated people mover (APM) train called the Transit which shuttles passengers between the Terminal 5A building (Gates A1-A23), Terminal 5B (Gates B32-B48), and Terminal 5C (Gates C52-C66).\nTo reach the satellite building within Terminal 2, there is a series of escalators and travellators that take passengers below the tarmac to move between the Terminal 2A (Gates A1-A26) building and Terminal 2B (Gates B30-B49). Give yourself at least 15 min to move between the areas. If you are connecting between two flights at the satellite building, you'll need to make your way to the main building, clear security, then make your way back to the satellite building to catch your connecting flight.\nIt's always good to have a little extra time when transferring from one flight to another, and this is true especially in a place like Heathrow. On a really busy day or during inclement weather your plane may not be allowed to land at its scheduled time, therefore two or three hours is certainly not \"too much\" time, especially if your next flight departs from another terminal.\n\n\nWait\n\nHeathrow encourages its passengers to wait near the restaurants, shops, and duty free areas by deliberately waiting to announce gate assignments until 45-90 minutes before flights depart. As the walk to your gate can take 10-20 minutes, pay attention to announcements and keep an eye on the time, lest you miss your flight.\nNone of the terminals have a viewing gallery that is accessible from landside, but the Heathrow Academy on the Northern Perimeter Road has a viewing deck which gives good views of the northern runway (27R/9L).  It is adjacent to the Renaissance Hotel, and the buses within the airport campus (numbers 105, 111, 140 and 235) stop at the deck.\nHatton Cross tube station is also a good spot for viewing the end of the runways, depending on what time of day the aircraft are landing or departing.\n\n\nLounges\nDue to the prominent status of London as a destination, many airlines have their own specific lounges:\n\n1 Aer Lingus Lounge. \u00a330/\u20ac30. (updated Jul 2018)\n Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge, Terminal 2B. 6AM-10PM. (updated Jul 2018)\n American Airlines Lounges. (updated Jul 2018)\n American Arrivals Lounge. (updated Jul 2018)\n American Admirals Club. (updated Jul 2018)\n British Airways Lounges. (updated Jul 2018)\n British Airways Concorde Room, Terminal 5 South Concourse, after security on Level 3 (after security, turn right and head toward \"Millionaire's Door\" to take a First Class exclusive passageway to the lounge - it's almost at the southern end of the terminal). This elite, exclusive lounge only has one other location - New York JFK - and is restricted to British Airways First Class passengers and Concorde Card holders. It has, interestingly, three private cabanas available for rental, which are not available at the JFK location (more details below). It also has a terrace with a sweeping window where one can look at the flights, but be warned that there is a lack of outlets. (updated Jul 2018)\n British Airways Concorde Room Cabanas. 5:30AM-10PM. Private room with a lounge chair and an ottoman, as well as an ordinary chair. Each one has a private bathroom, which means that it can be a good way to save time as the main showers of the Concorde Room are shared with other lounges. Room service available.
