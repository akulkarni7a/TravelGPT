  "extract": "Orleans (French: Orl\u00e9ans) is the capital of the Centre-Val de Loire region of north-central France, located some 120 km (75 miles) south-west of the French capital, Paris. The city has just above 100,000 citizens, with a total of 400,000 in the metropolitan area.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe best way to get to Orleans by plane is to fly into either one of the two Paris Airports.\nMost international carriers will service Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG IATA), but most low-cost carriers will service Orly. Orly Airport (ORY IATA) is slightly closer to Orleans if you are driving, but neither airport provides direct services to Orleans and one will most likely have to transfer in Paris.\n\n\nBy train\n\nThere are plenty of trains from Paris (Gare d'Austerlitz, 1 h) and other cities in Northern France, including high-speed TGV services. Notice that most long-distance trains does not call at the central station but rather at Les Aubrais railway station north of the city centre. The station is connected via tramway to the city centre.\nRegional trains call at both Les Aubrais and at the central Orl\u00e9ans railway station.\n\n1 Les Aubrais railway station (Gare des Aubrais), Rue Lamartine.   (updated Aug 2022)\n2 Orl\u00e9ans railway station (Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans), Avenue de Paris (Next to Place Jean d'Arc).   (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\nBy car\nTake the A10 motorway south-west from Paris. The trip will be slightly one hour and a half.\nYou can also drive along the N20, which is a toll free road, and goes straight from Paris to Orleans. The route can is a bit longer than the highway as the road takes you through a number of villages.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n\nBy boat\nLoire river is the main river in the city. It used to be navigable at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe best way to travel around the historic centre of the city is by foot or bike. The city is not large so by foot is the best way. Many bike rental stations allow you to use a bike from point A to B for a small fee. For attractions further away (in particular the Parc Floral), the tram and bus service are useful.\nLocal transit is operated by TAO Orl\u00e9ans: Tram, Bus, Bike rental, Car parking and Park and Ride services. Their website has automatic translation by Google and the English translation is usable. Downloadable transit route maps and a journey planner are provided on the TAO website. Google Maps does not know about the trams or buses in Orl\u00e9ans (as of summer 2020) so do not rely on it for transit information.\n\n\nTicketing\nCash is accepted on board buses (and payment cards are not).\nCards and cash are accepted at ticket machines found at every tram stop.\nTickets can be purchased ahead of time and validated at the start of journey (including 24 hour tickets).\nThe same tickets are valid on bus, tram, etc.\nTicket types\nSingle journey ticket \u20ac1.60\nReturn journey ticket (two singles) \u20ac3.20\n10-journey ticket \u20ac14.30\n24 hour ticket. In practice these are often valid for longer periods, for example from 14:00 on one day to 23:00 the next day. \u20ac4.00\nGroup tickets, student discounts, etc, are available. The TAO website has a full list of ticket types.\n\n\nBy tram\nTAO Orl\u00e9ans (Keolis) operates two tram lines. Line A runs roughly north-south (to the university and the nearby suburb of Olivet) and Line B runs east-west, crossing at the de Gaulle stop in the center of the city. Trams run every 10 minutes during the day and every 20-30 minutes in the evening until about 23:30.\n\n\nBy bus\nTAO Orl\u00e9ans operates a bus network centered on the Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans (main train station). Buses do not go through the historic centre and mainly serve the residential areas of the city. Tourists may find them useful to get to outlying attractions or hotels outside the historic centre.\n\n\nBy car\nThe historic centre of Orl\u00e9ans is largely pedestrianised, driving is difficult, and parking is near-impossible.\nOutside the historic centre, paid parking is available on main streets.\nThere are several large parking garages near the historic centre and cheaper park and ride facilities further out.\n\n\nSee\n1 La Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-Croix (Ste-Croix Cathedral), http://www.orleans.catholique.fr/.
