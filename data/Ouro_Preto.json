  "extract": "Ouro Preto, in Central Minas Gerais, is one of Brazil's best-preserved colonial towns and a UNESCO world heritage site. Among other historical and colonial cities of Minas Gerais (Tiradentes, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei, Mariana and Diamantina), Ouro Preto is one of the most popular travel destinations in Brazil.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nOuro Preto, meaning \"black gold\", was founded in 1698 and quickly became the epicenter of a new gold rush, as the central place where gold was brought to be measured and sold. In 1720 the state capital was transferred here from nearby Mariana. By 1750 Ouro Preto's population had swelled to over 110,000, making it one of the largest cities in the Americas; at the time it had twice as many inhabitants as New York City and five times more than Rio de Janeiro. The city's success inspired the naming of many other cities and neighborhoods, including the founding of the American city of Brazil, Indiana.\nAs a result of the gold trade, the town, then known as Vila Rica, took a significant place in Brazilian history, being the site of the Inconfid\u00eancia Mineira, the first attempted uprising in the cause of independence from Portuguese colonial rule. The revolt was led by Brazilian cultural hero Tiradentes in 1789 after he realized how much of the region's gold was going straight onto boats bound for Portugal. The revolt failed however, and after Tiradentes was tried and executed, he was dismembered and various body parts were displayed along the road between Ouro Preto and Rio de Janeiro to discourage his followers. His head was placed in what is now known as Pra\u00e7a Tiradentes, at the very center of town.\nIn 1822, Brazil finally gained its independence, and the following year Ouro Preto was given the title of \"Imperial City\" by Brazil's first emperor, Dom Pedro I. In 1839, South America's first pharmacy school was established here, and in 1876, Dom Pedro II founded the Escola de Minas (Mining School), focused on mining and metallurgy. It has since become one of the country's premier engineering federal universities.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the gold had run out, growth had slowed to a halt. The population plummeted when the capital was moved to the newly founded Belo Horizonte in 1897. Lack of new construction provided for the preservation of the colonial architecture, and Ouro Preto was forgotten in time until Dictator Get\u00falio Vargas, who had briefly studied in this city in his youth,   began having some sites restored in the 1950s. Since then, it has gradually become more of a tourist destination as one of the best-preserved colonial cities in Brazil. It is particularly noted for its churches, which are special not only for their architecture but also for the carved sculptures by Aleijadinho, one of Brazil's most celebrated artists. Ouro Preto was the first Brazilian location to be declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1980.\n\n\nClimate\n\n\nGet in\n\nOuro Preto is about 100 km from Belo Horizonte, 400 km from Rio de Janeiro, and 680 km from S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\nBy plane\nThe nearest convenient airports are those of Belo Horizonte, especially that of Confins. From there, you must get to Ouro Preto by car or bus.\n\n\nBy car\nOuro Preto sits on BR-356 about 120 km southeast of Belo Horizonte and about 18 km west of Mariana.\nDrivers coming from Juiz de Fora and Rio de Janeiro in the south should take BR-040 to Conselheiro Lafaiete, take the Ouro Branco Highway and once in Ouro Branco transfer to state highway MG-443 for the last 12 or so km to Ouro Preto.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses arrive at the 1 rodovi\u00e1ria on the northwestern edge of town. It is an easy downhill walk into the historic center.\n\nFrom Belo Horizonte, by P\u00e1ssaro Verde, \u260f +55 31 3201-2687, 2 hr. 16 departures daily.\nFrom S\u00e3o Paulo, by \u00datil, 2 departures daily at 06:45 and 23:45.\nFrom Rio de Janeiro, by \u00datil, \u260f +55 21 2253-3884. 7h.

The ride takes 12 hours.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nThe town's small size and steep hills make walking the most convenient way of getting around the city center. Bring some good shoes and be prepared to huff and puff a bit, as the streets are cobbled and you will spend the day walking up and down steep hills. Travellers with impaired mobility may have a hard time getting around.\n\n\nBy bus\nCity buses run to neighborhoods outside of the city center, as well as to neighboring towns like Mariana. Use the app Moovit provides directions.\n\n\nBy taxi\nSimply use the app OP Expert.

The visit to the mine is accompanied by a guide (who normally does not speak English, so make sure you have someone who can translate for you).

The walking space is very limited and in certain locations can be claustrophobic for those who do not enjoy enclosed spaces. R$5. \n\n\nDo\n\n\nFestivals\nCarnaval - Ouro Preto is increasingly popular during Carnaval, especially with college students. Although the city loses some of its tranquil historic charm, the steep streets preclude the raucous loudspeaker trucks found in other cities like Salvador, and people generally just party in the streets.
