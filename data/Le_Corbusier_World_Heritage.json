Curutchet House is a landmark to visit in La Plata. It is located in a green, sunny area with plenty of plants and trees facing the \u201cPaseo del Bosque\u201d park. It is one of the very few buildings in the Americas designed by the famous architect Le Corbusier. He projected four levels with a ramp and a spiral staircase mainly because the piece of land where it was built was very narrow.
