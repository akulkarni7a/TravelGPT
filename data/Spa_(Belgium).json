  "extract": "Spa is a town in the Li\u00e8ge province in Belgium, known as the \"original\" spa, i.e. a place where tourists came in to enjoy the health and wellness benefits of water and hot springs in particular. The springs in Spa became so popular that the name became genericized to mean any such place, with other versions of how it came to be also created over the years. Indeed, Spa is now one of 11 \"Great Spa Towns of Europe\", a transcontinental UNESCO world heritage site. Apart from the mineral waters, Spa also draws crowds several times a year when racing and other events are held at the nearby Spa-Francorchamps track. \n\n\nUnderstand\nThe town is famous for its mineral water. The word spa comes from the name of this town, though folk etymologies \u2014 and several marketing campaigns \u2014 claim the word to be an acronym of \"sanitus per aqua\" or some other Latin phrase.\n\n\nGet in\nSpa is connected to the Belgian railway network by a side line branching out in Pepinster from the Liege-Aachen line. The 1 Spa Railway Station is just west of the city center.  The direct local trains from Aachen are discontinued since 2024 and getting to Spa from most origins in Belgium by train requires at least one change of trains in Pepinster, which on weekdays sees InterCity Line 12 service from Brussels and Li\u00e8ge, in addition to local train services. \nOne can of course also arrive by car, the journey from Brussels takes around 1.5 h.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe centre of Spa is relatively small, but many attractions are in farther villages and neighbouring municipalities. TEC runs a network of bus lines connecting them.\n\n\nSee\n1 \u00c9glise Saint-Remacle. This ancient-looking church was built to follow late Roman style prevalent in the region closely, but was in fact built in 1885.  (updated Jun 2016)\n\n2 Bains de Spa. The old building of the city baths has been closed since 2005 and projects are underway to turn it into a luxury hotel. The baths are now in a modern facility in the woods.

Spa's emblematic building houses the mineral water fountain named after the Russian Tsar Peter the Great, who visited the city in the 18th century and became a big fan of its healing and wellness qualities. (updated Jun 2016)\n\n4 Mus\u00e9e de la ville d'eaux (Villa royale Marie-Henriette). The city museum collects artifacts of the history of Spa with focus on its springs and related developments.
