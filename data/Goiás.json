The original word seems to have been guai\u00e1, meaning \"the same person\" or \"people of the same origin.\" \nThe most central of the Brazilian states and the most populous of the region, Goi\u00e1s is characterized by a landscape of plateaus. In the height of the drought season, from June to September, the lack of rain makes the level of the Araguaia River go down and exposes almost 2 km of beaches, making it the main attraction of the state.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe largest airport in the state is the Santa Genoveva International Airport GYN  IATA, in Goi\u00e2nia , which has domestic and international flights. Depending on where you are going, it is more practical to fly to Brasilia. Nelson Ribeiro Guimar\u00e3es Airport (CLV IATA) in Caldas Novas has local flights. \n\n\nBy car\nThe State of Goi\u00e1s is located at an important national road junction. The national and state road network is present throughout the state, with more than 92% of paved roads.\n\n\nBy bus\nAlmost all cities have a bus terminal with buses to various cities in the country. Consult the coverage areas of the bus companies.

Many of these souvenirs are very amusing and resemble items from the state, such as pequi, farms, kitchen utensils from Goi\u00e1s. \nIn medium-sized cities such as An\u00e1polis, Jata\u00ed, Rio Verde, Itumbiara and Luzi\u00e2nia there are good malls with big brands.\nIn Goi\u00e2nia, trade is quite diversified. You can buy everything. In addition, the capital of Goi\u00e1s is known for its low prices, especially for clothing. Therefore, many retailers from the North region come to shop in the city.\n\n\nEat\nPamonha - Brazilian local delicacy. It can be savoury or sweet; \u00e0 moda (a lot of possibilities; most common is savoury paste with sausage and cheese); \"Romeu and Julieta\" (guava and cheese).\nPequi - local fruit. Apreciated by locals, especially with rice or chicken. It has a peculiar smell. Please don't bite, there are lots of thorns. You have to just gnaw.\nThe cuisine of Goi\u00e1s is very diverse, with its main dishes being fish on the tile , su\u00e3 (pork meat) with rice, rice with pequi , and also the everyday Brazilian dishes such as rice and beans; in addition to pamonha, which is used as the main dish at meals; the fruits are the jaboticaba, the guabiroba, the jatob\u00e1, among many others from the cerrado. Mixtures, the name given to vegetables such as milkweed and taioba, also stand out, in addition to the introduction of guariroba, one of the main ingredients in casserole, as a vegetable in the almost daily diet. The greengrocer, the name given to homemade biscuits, is also diversified: breaker, man\u00e9 pelado (cassava cake baked in banana leaves), cheese biscuit (which was invented in Goi\u00e1s), lie (fried manioc biscuit), peta, the almost forgotten brevidade (povilho beaten with eggs and sugar), the dulce de leche pastry and the sweet rice cake (the latter two are typical greengrocers in the City of Goi\u00e1s). The variety of sweets is extremely rich: marmalade in a box (in the region of Luzi\u00e2nia), \u201cMo\u00e7a-de-Engenho\u201d or \u201cMo\u00e7a Branca\u201d (molasses beaten and framed in the form of a sculpture),milk jam (mainly with grated papaya sticks or grated cider), egg jam (ambrosia made directly in molasses), candied fruit jam (very rich in Piren\u00f3polis), grated cider jam, fruit peel (orange, lemon), among many others. Seasoned brown sugar (with milk, orange peel, cider or peanuts).\nThe seasonings are very diverse, with a cuisine rich in spices such as saffron and ginger.\nPequi, for example, in the old villages of Meia Ponte (today Piren\u00f3polis) and Vila Boa, still in the beginning of the 18th century, began to be used in the cuisine of Goi\u00e1s. In the region surrounding the industrial city of Catal\u00e3o , pequi was only used in the manufacture of pequi soap, with therapeutic properties. Today it is marketed in jam.\nThe fruit can be tasted in the most varied ways: cooked, in rice, in chicken, with pasta, with fish, with meat, with milk and in the form of one of the most appreciated liqueurs in Goi\u00e1s.\n'Rice with pequi: Made with the typical fruit from Goi\u00e1s.
