  "extract": "Santa Cruz (or Santa Cruz de la Sierra) is the capital of the department of Santa Cruz.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSanta Cruz is the most populous city and heart of the second most populous metropolitan area in Bolivia, and it is considered the most economically prosperous city in the country.\nSanta Cruz is a boomtown whose population has increased tenfold in the last 25 years, it is almost in the center of Bolivia and is the capital city of the department of Santa Cruz. It lies at one end of the Death Train's line.\n\n\nHistory\nFor its first 400 years Santa Cruz was very poor and far from potential markets to be able to grow at all. It shares this with the rest of eastern, northern and south eastern Bolivia for most of its history, up until some 50 years ago when a paved road was opened and the possibility of markets opened which summed with some royalties from oil production they also started receiving served as seed to one of the fastest growing cities and economies in the continent. Growth was slow to start but after some 20 years it was spectacular. Today it is difficult to imagine this city and provincial towns of the department for what they really were some 25 or 50 years ago.\n\n\nClimate\nIn contrast to La Paz and the other major Bolivian cities located high in the Andes, Santa Cruz lies at an altitude of 416 meters, and its climate is distinctly tropical. Santa Cruz is furrowed by drainage ditches.\nDuring the winter months of July-August, there are occasional periods when strong Southern Winds (Surazos) come from Argentina and bring a cold front accompanied by extreme winds.\n\n\nTalk\nAlthough, the country\u00b4s official language and main language is Spanish, most places (stores specially) will be able to understand Portuguese and English. If they do not speak those languages, they will probably get someone that does. The people are really friendly, they will try their truly best to talk to you if you are a foreigner.\n\n\nGet in\nIf you arrive during carnival (during February, sometimes March) it is almost impossible to change money as everything except markets, restaurants and internet cafes are closed. Traders will accept U.S. dollars but at half the going rate. Also be prepared to be pelted with ink filled water balloons, soaked with water bombs and covered in string spray. Wear clothes you don`t mind having permanently stained.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are many bus companies from another cities, like Cochabamba, La Paz, Sucre, Trinidad, that go to Santa Cruz de la Sierra. You can arrive from La Paz in about 18 hours, and it takes about 10 hours from Cochabamba.\nTo and from the Brazilian border in Corumba/Puerto Quijarro is cheaper and faster (10 hr and tickets from Bs. 40) than the famous death train.\nAsunci\u00f3n (Paraguay) \u2013 The bus is extremely slow (the Transchaco Highway is only paved as far as the Bolivian border), buses generally travel only at night - meaning that you miss out on any views of the Chaco, and roadblocks on the Bolivian side of the border can cause your journey time to double. There is at least one bus daily. The trip takes 21-24 hr, costs US$40-60 (bargain if you can), and flights might actually only be marginally more expensive, depending on the time of booking. Any intermediate exit or boarding (like Filadelfia or Villamontes) will likely cost the same as the complete trip. But if your nerves are strong, you will get the price down bargaining directly with the bus driver.\nA taxi from the bus terminal to the center will cost about Bs. 12.\n\n\nBy train\nThe \"death train\" (so named because of its history in transporting Yellow Fever victims) runs on bumpy tracks from Puerto Quijarro, close to Corumb\u00e1 on the Brazilian side. There is a variety of different trains offering different classes and prices. The journey takes 13-17 hr. The most comfortable option, with cama seats, is the \"Ferrobus\" (Tu Th Sa) which costs Bs. 235 per person (Jul 2019). Expreso Oriental needs longer, but only costs Bs. 70. Tickets can be purchased days in advance at the station (Terminal Bimodal) or online (ticktsBolivia.com, plus a US$7 fee). Biting insects are plentiful, so get repellent before you go. It's also a good idea to have blankets or a sleeping bag with you in the colder months of June-August.\nThe railway between Santa Cruz and Puerto Quijarro is operated by Ferroviaria Oriental S.A..\n\nFor crossing the border see Puerto Quijarro.\nFrom Corumb\u00e1 the bus-ride to Sao Paulo takes about another 24 hr.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Viru Viru International Airport (VVI  IATA). Bolivia's largest and most modern airport, and a hub for BoA. International flights on BoA travel to Madrid, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Buenos Aires with other destinations on the horizon. AeroSur is no longer operational. American Airlines flies direct to Miami. Other options include a variety of destinations via Panama, and LATAM and Avianca also fly to Santa Cruz. Gol Airlines and Aerolineas Argentinas also offer flights to S\u00e3o Paulo and Buenos Aires, respectively. Air Europa also flies direct to Madrid.   \nGetting there/away: To get into downtown Santa Cruz from the airport you have two options. The first is to take a taxi that will charge you approximately Bs. 50. This is probably the easiest and most comfortable way to get into town. Make sure to ask the driver the fare since there is not a sign with prices to different parts of the city. If you are on a tight budget the second option is a \"micro\" or mini-bus that waits outside the front doors of the airport that leaves every 20 min, the fare for the bus is Bs. 6.50. There is an additional surcharge of Bs. 4 for the buses that depart after 22:00. This bus follows the Cristo Redentor Avenue and then along the First Ring where it stops near the former bus terminal. To get to the main plaza, ask the driver to let you off at Libertad and Primer Anillo (First Ring). From there, it is about a seven-block walk.\n2 El Trompillo Airport (SRZ  IATA). It is the city's older airport. Major airlines have daily flights to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, mainly from La Paz (about 4 flights per day: early in the morning, in the afternoon, early in the evening, and late in the night). From Cochabamba (about 2 flights per day). Flights to international cities are also daily, (Sao Paulo, Brasil - Buenos Aires, Argentina - Lima, Peru - there are daily flights). American Airlines has daily service to and from Miami.   \nGetting there/away: Trompillo is very close to the city center, and is thus a cheaper taxi ride. Micros also pass by the airport, exit the departure hall and walk down the road to the right until you reach an intersection. Cross the street and wait for Micro 40 or 42. The information counter in the airport provides helpful information and distributes free maps.\nAbout Bolivian airlines and flying within Bolivia: Bolivia#Get_around\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\nMicros 17 and 18 travel the first ring, Micros 72 and 73 travel the second ring. To get to the center from Parque Urbano take Micro 69 or 100. You can pick up a map of all the bus routes from many \"librerias\" or bookstores downtown. There is also a great mobile app called Cruzero (both for iOS and Android) which contains route maps of all micros. It can also find you an optimal route if you just select the source and the destination on the city map. There is a website with the same content as well: http://cruzero.net/.\nThe fare for most micros is Bs. 2, but some of the ones that go further charge more, and the one that goes to the airport charges Bs. 6.\nShared taxis circulate the rings as well, they are called \"trufis\". Look for the signs on the roof. Faster than Micros and more comfortable because you can actually sit down. The fare for most trufis is Bs. 2.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis in Santa Cruz are relatively expensive to other Bolivian cities. Make sure to settle on a price with a driver before heading to your destination. Fares are typically around Bs. 10-15, but if the driver senses you are a tourist they may charge you upwards of Bs. 20-40. Prices to the airport may be between Bs. 60-90.\nUber has been operating in Santa Cruz. Fares are very competitive with radio taxis or taxis hailed from the street with cars generally in good condition with air conditioning. Option to pay in cash also available. \nInDriver is the most common app used in Santa Cruz. You set your own price for a trip and wait until a driver accepts it. You can set a lower rate but may wait longer until someone accepts.\nEasy Taxi is another app-based service.\n\n\nSee\n\nEl Rio Pirai - this is the river that symbolizes so much to Santa Cruz citizens.\nMonse\u00f1or Rivero (Boulevard Cruce\u00f1o) - this is where most people spend the late afternoon portion of the days; starting at 17:00.\nLa Plaza - go on a Sunday, at around 23:00... just feel the breeze, relax, and close your eyes. Also, and *very* important: get a \"cafe con leche\" or \"cafe cortadito\" from anyone who sells them, especially if you see on their shirts the name \"Cafe Marcelino\". Best coffee of your life.\n\n\nBeyond the city\nIn Santa Cruz you can book some great excursions, like a trekking in Park Amboro, Noel Kempff, a river boat trip in the Amazon region, cultural excursions to the Jesuit Missions etc.\n\n\nDo\n1 Climb the church tower. Of the Cathedral of Santa Cruz. Bs. 3. (updated May 2018)\n2 Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Municipal (Zool\u00f3gico Municipal) (Minibus 32 verde). Not so big but quite pleasant zoo focused on South American animals. There is a food court and some kiosks inside. Many micros pass by the entrance, e.g. the one to Cotoca. Bs. 10. (updated May 2018)\n3 Sloths of Cotoca. Go sloth \"hunting\" with your camera at the plaza of Cotoca and try if you can spot the 6ish sloths in the treetops without the help of the locals. Basically, they are high up in the trees, not moving and looking like a roundish part of the tree, but sometimes you can catch a face or their fingers. You probably will never see them move much, this is just the expectation you have from various documentaries about them, a slowly moving sloth. (updated May 2018)\nBiocentro & Resort G\u00fcemb\u00e9. Nature park with a big aviary, butterfly conservatory, monkey island, monkey enclosure and some other animals. There are also a few swimming pools and a restaurant. It's a few km out of Santa Cruz, but there is a shuttle bus from Ventura Mall going there every day at 10.00, 11.00, 12.00 and 13.00 (as of April 2018). Single fare Bs. 10. The bus stops at Cuarto Anillo street just in front of the mall. The stop is not signposted, but the bus has some G\u00fcemb\u00e9 labels on it. There are also return buses at 14.30 and 16.45. Entrance fee to the park is Bs. 140 which is a bit pricey for the value you get, but having said that the aviary is really nice and the whole area is really well-maintained.\n CineCenter (on the 2nd Ring). A movie theater complex with a variety of film offerings, a food court, shopping mall, and some high-end cafes and restaurants. It also has a 3D movie theater, a video arcade, and an indoor playground for small children. A good place to go especially on Sundays. \n Estadio Ram\u00f3n Tahuichi Aguilera (Main Stadium) (inside the 1st Ring). Hosts soccer games and the occasional high-profile concert. Can get crowded during The Clasico when Santa Cruz's two main soccer teams, Oriente Petrolero and Blooming, play against each other.

During the day you can pay to enter the cathedral's small museum and climb to the top of the belltower (Bs 3), where you can get a nice view of the plaza from above. \n Caba\u00f1as del Rio Pirai (West part of the city, reachable by minibuses which can be found by walking west from central plaza). Little houses close to the river, where people entertain, and where you can taste some local dishes. (updated Jan 2019)\n\n\nAround the city\n\n Yvaga Guazu park (Out of the city, on the road to La Guardia. Catch a minibus (ask people) with red markings somewhere close to 2nd ring on the street leading to La Guardia. Ask the driver to stop at Yvaga Guazu park.). People say, vegetation in Yvaga Guazu resembles vegetation in big national parks like Madidi, Noel Kempf Mercado, etc. So, if you can't visit these parks, try to visit Yvaga Guazu. They have guides in Spanish. (updated Jan 2019)\n Lomas de Arena (Out of the city. You can get there by minibus 21 (goes each 5 min; ask the driver to stop at Lomas de Arena) and walk (7,5 km). For the right place to catch minibus, ask people at the crossroads on east corner of El Trompillo airport on the 2nd ring.). Quite impressive sand desert. You can walk over sand dunes, watch birds and ants (termites?). There is a marketplace close to the ticket office, you can buy water and food. From the ticket office to the desert is a 7.5 km road (single, you won't get lost) to the desert, takes 1.5 hr to walk but you can ask for a \"mototaxi\". Bs. 10.

Costs about Bs. 35 per main dish. The Majao del Pato (spicy rice dish with duck, egg and bananas) is very tasty, as is the Locro de Gallina (hearty chicken soup). Popular with locals. \nCapri \u2013 Many locations including Avenida Monse\u00f1or Rivero and Avenida Melchor Pinto. Excellent pizzeria with Italian-style pizza. Owned by an Argentinian of Italian descent. Pizzas cost around Bs. 50 each and are large enough to share between two people.\nEmpanaderia Las Charcas \u2013 On Avenida Melchor Pinto, one of the best empanaderias in the centre. They are fried while you wait and cost Bs. 6 or 7 each depending on the filling (the Lech\u00f3n, or suckling pig, filling is one of the richest).\nPapa Jack \u2013 A very impressive restaurant located in an ally near Avenida Monse\u00f1or Rivero.

Based on Hemingway's favorite haunt in La Habana, this is a pleasant Cuban bar.

(updated May 2018)\nSupermarkets \u2013 5 main supermarket chain service the population. Prices are generally higher than in the Europe since a great part of the available groceries is imported. Same applies for cosmetics and accessories. IC Norte, Fidalga, Hipermaxi, HiperPlaza and SLAN basically offer the same range of producuts and none is significantly better or cheaper than the other. The Hipermaxi in Av. Banzer has usually freshly baked goods , the Fidalga on the other side of the street is pretty new and has a nice food court.\nClothes, furniture, etc. \u2013 In this section as well a great deal of the products is imported resulting in a higher price than usual in western countries. Cheaper, second hand articles can be found in the markets of La Ramada or Los Pozos. There are no big stores such as BestBuy or IKEA that offer this kind of secondary need products in a large scale environment.\nSouvenirs \u2013 Although tyipical Bolivian Souvenirs can be found cheaper and in better quality and variety in the Andean region, Santa Cruz offers those as well mainly around the main Plaza 24 de Septiembre. Typically Oriental Bolivian products can be found there as well. A nice alternative is the handicrafts market on Sundays behind the main church in the so called Manzana 1. Accessories store Hevea Bolivia Accessories offers stylish handbags and accessories (you guessed it) in its own workshop made from recycled tire inner tubes. Direction is Calle Nuflo de Chavez #715, almost first ring.\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nBudget\nThere are some hotels close to the bus terminal which is a bit further away from the center.

The road through the Chaco is quite good, but the trip is very long.\nCorumb\u00e1, Brazil \u2013 Take the famous Death Train to the Brazilian border and from there head west into Brazil or south into Paraguay.
