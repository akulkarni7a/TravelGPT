The mountain range reaches above 3000 ft (1000 m.) and is largely uninhabited and natural terrain, apart from some small attractive villages. There is one very narrow winding road running South-North from Lourmarin to Apt over the mountains with occasional views over the Provence countryside. Much of this is fairly unspoilt agricultural land with many vineyards contributing to the underrated Cotes du Luberon appellation. Very popular with cyclists, hill walkers and rock climbers, the area has remained largely unspoilt for centuries.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
