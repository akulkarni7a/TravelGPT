The town also offers a number of historical sites including churches from several different periods and a well preserved Roman colosseum. The town itself has the usual Spanish assortment of plazas sprinkled with cafes and tapas bars.

However, you always have the chance to take a stopping train, which is reasonable when coming from Barcelona, as it basically takes the same amount of time.\nLines  R14  R15  R16  serve Barcelona.\nTarragona is also close to the 2 Camp de Tarragona AVE station , on the Madrid-Barcelona High Speed line. From Camp de Tarragona, high speed trains run to Zaragoza, Madrid, Sevilla, Malaga, Burgos, Vigo, Bilbao and San Sebastian, as well as the 'Trenhotel' night trains to Burgos, Vigo, A Coru\u00f1a and Gijon. From the station, Plana (+34 977 553 680) runs buses regularly to Tarragona between 6:00-23:00; the trip takes about 20 minutes. Taxis are also readily available.\n\n\nBy plane\n3 Reus Airport  (REU IATA) is 9 km from Tarragona. Reus is mainly served by charter flights and Ryanair. Taxis can be hired to take you to Tarragona for roughly \u20ac30. Hispano Igualadina (+34 902 292 900) provides service to Tarragona's bus station from Reus Airport 3-5 times per day.\nThe nearest major airport is Barcelona El Prat (BCN IATA), about 90 km away. Transfers from Barcelona's airport can be by train, bus, hiring a taxi or renting a car.\n\n\nBy car\nTarragona is on the AP-7 (Autopista de la Mediterr\u00e0nia) motorway. Barcelona is roughly 100 km northeast and Valencia is roughly 250 km (just under 3 hrs) south. North of Tarragona, the AP-7 is a toll road, but south it is toll-free. The tolls north of Tarragona are expected to be removed in Sept 2021.\nTarragona also connects to the AP-2 motorway, via the A-27 and N-240 highways.
