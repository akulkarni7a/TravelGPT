  "extract": "Tiradentes is one of the smallest yet best preserved colonial towns in the Brazilian State of Minas Gerais. It has a population of about 6000 and boasts some fine examples of 300-year old buildings, like the impressive gold-filled Matriz church. It is also well-known amongst food lovers for its food festival in August and its many good regional and modern restaurants.\n\n\nGet in\nTiradentes is 14 km from S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei, 215 km from Belo Horizonte, 325 km from Rio de Janeiro and 483 from S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are about 10 buses a day from (and to) S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei (8 on weekends). The bus station (Rodovi\u00e1ria) is located near the S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula church at Pra\u00e7a Silva Jardim. Tel: (32) 3355-1100. There are no ticket booths, pay onboard.\n\n\nBy train\nOn weekends, the maria-fuma\u00e7a (steam train) leaves the neighbouring city of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei twice a day (10:00 and 15:00). The 35-minute trip is a nice way to get into town in full \"vintage\" style.\n\n\nGet around\nCars are allowed to circulate, but given the compact size of the old town, slowly walking around is by far the best way to see and feel the place. The irregular ancient pavement may not be quite friendly to those with locomotion disabilities, though.\n\n\nSee\n\nBuildings from times long gone and the cobblestone streets give Tiradentes a very special feeling. Its main attractions include:\n\n\nChurches\n Church of Saint Anthony (Igreja de Santo Ant\u00f4nio/Igreja Matriz) (at the end of Rua da C\u00e2mara). Beautiful church constructed in 1732 with the richest gold foil interior of any church in Brazil. No photography allowed inside. \n Ros\u00e1rio dos Pretos. \n S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula. The nicest views of Tiradentes, from a hilltop. \n\n\nMuseums\n Casa da Cultura. \n Padre Toledo. \n Yves Alves Cultural Center. \n\n\nOther structures\n\n Chafariz. A fountain dating back to the 1700s. \n Old Town Council Hall (Casa da C\u00e2mara). \n Stone Bridge. \n\n\nDo\nSmall Carriage tours leave the Largo das Forras square and the train station to visit the main attractions in the old town. The 1-hour ride costs R$ 15 and carries up to 4 persons.\nTrekking in the nearby mountains of Serra de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9.\nCultural and gastronomic festival in August\n\n\nBuy\nThere are many sweets and crafts shops around town. Most of the crafts are actually made by people living at the Bichinho district, separated from town by a narrow, 7-km-long dust road. Go there if you want to get cheaper prices buy from the artists directly, but be prepared to gold-dig a little bit.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nBudget\n Dona Xepa, Rua Ministro Gabriel Passos, 26, \u260f +55 32 3355-1767.
