  "extract": "Brazilian Portuguese (portugu\u00eas brasileiro) is the variety of Portuguese spoken in Brazil.  European Portuguese differs from the Brazilian variety in pronunciation, as well as in some vocabulary, though the written language is much closer than the oral. Due to the wide distribution of Brazilian television programs to the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world, many speakers in the Eastern Hemisphere can converse with Brazilians without great difficulty. Brazilians may have difficulty understanding certain words, especially slang terms, in European Portuguese but in general, if spoken slowly, educated speakers of either variety of Portuguese can understand each other.\n\n\nAlphabet\nThe Portuguese alphabet (alfabeto) has 23 letters, plus 3 foreign ones. Accented vowels, cedillas (see below), diphthongs, digraphs (including ch), etc. do not count separately.  The alphabet is a b c d e f g h i j l m n o p q r s t u v x z with additional characters \u00e1 \u00e0 \u00e2 \u00e3 \u00e7 \u00e9 \u00ea \u00ed \u00f3 \u00f4 \u00f5 \u00fa.  By far the most common diphthong is  \u00e3o.  The alphabet, when pronounced, is similar to Spanish:  \u00e1 b\u00ea c\u00ea d\u00ea \u00e9 efe g\u00ea ag\u00e1 i jota ele eme ene \u00f3 p\u00ea qu\u00ea erre esse t\u00ea u v\u00ea xis z\u00ea.  The letters k (k\u00e1), w (d\u00e1bliu), and y (\u00edpsilon) are usually used only in words of foreign origin.  In Brazil, this includes most of the indigenous languages, as their writing was developed by German anthropologists.  Words such as  Kayap\u00f3, Wapishana, and Yanomami refer to the names of a few of these indigenous tribes.\n\n\nGrammar\n\n\nWritten vs. spoken\nIn Brazil, spoken language can be very different from written language and official grammar, confusing non-native speakers. While g\u00edria (slang) is common and difficult to understand, it is generally not used around foreigners. Less educated people are likely to use slang a lot. The written language is also much closer to Spanish than what is spoken. But make no mistake, Brazilian Portuguese is phonetically much closer to modern Galician than to European Portuguese, let alone Spanish. If you're a Spanish speaker and try speaking \"portu\u00f1ol\", people will most likely look at you in confusion and wonder what you're saying, if not going into \"what a stupid gringo\" mode.\n\n\nGender, plurals, and adjectives\nTo avoid duplication, see wikibooks.  Also, Portuguese words ending in _\u00e3o are often, but not always, feminine.  Their plurals, most of the time, simply replace _\u00e3o with _\u00f5es. (Example: a televis\u00e3o, as televis\u00f5es)  To be sure, look it up in a dictionary.  Even words that are the same in both English and Portuguese can be different in plural form, depending on the last letter.  Example: 1 hotel (oh TEL), 2 hot\u00e9is (oh TAYS).\nIn Portuguese, the names of most countries of the world take the definite article, inflected according to the name's gender and number, e.g. 'o Brasil', 'o Peru', 'a Argentina', 'o Chile', 'os Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica', 'a China', 'o Jap\u00e3o', 'o Timor-Leste', 'as Filipinas'. The same is true for a few cities: Oporto in Portugal, 'o Rio de Janeiro', 'o Recife', 'o Prado' in Bahia, 'o Gama', 'o Guar\u00e1' and 'a Ceil\u00e2ndia' near Bras\u00edlia in Brazil. By contrast, calling The Hague 'a Haia' in a Brazilian Portuguese-speaking environment is somewhat pedantic, however correct, 'Haia' will do. Surprisingly, Portugal itself has no gender or article, along with most African Portuguese-speaking countries; the exception is 'a Guin\u00e9-Bissau'. For Lusophones, the funniest Portuguese-born toponym ever has always been a Rep\u00fablica dos Camar\u00f5es, literally \"The Shrimps' Republic\".\n\n\nPronouns for \"you\"\nThese can be a little confusing, especially for those transitioning from other Romance languages to Brazilian Portuguese. Originally in Portugal, the archaic Vossa Merc\u00ea, \"Your Mercy\", which in Brazil got shorter, vosmec\u00ea, and finally became voc\u00ea (vou-SAY), with its plural Vossas Merc\u00eas / vosmec\u00eas  / voc\u00eas (vou-SAYS), were the formal \"You\"; tu  and the plural v\u00f3s were the informal, with all four having conjugations of their own.  In the Brazilian contemporary context, v\u00f3s is only used to address God in prayer, and tu is properly conjugated only in certain areas of the North and Northeast. Elsewhere, tu is usually followed by the same verb endings as voc\u00ea.  Thus, most Brazilians do not use the verb endings for the 2nd person, making it much easier to learn just the 1st and 3rd person. However, they do use informally the 2nd person pronouns te ([to] you), ti ([for] you), teu/tua[s] (yours), contigo (with you), very similarly to Spanish and French (some highbrow university professors will even thus use vosso/vossa[s] and convosco in class).  Since this eliminates much of the grammar-based formality, to be formal, replace you with o senhor (oh sen-YOUR) for a man, a senhora (ah sen-YOUR-ah) for a woman, and a senhorita (ah sen-your-REE-tah) for a young unmarried lady.  This can also be done just before their name (equivalent to Mr., Mrs., and Miss respectively), or it can be spoken by itself initially (with or without a name) in order to get someone's attention.\n\n\nDropping the plural\nInformal speech in Brazil may avoid the plural altogether by using a gente (the people) for we and todo mundo (everybody) for they.  Both forms use 3rd person singular. There's a subtle difference between todo mundo (everybody) and todo o mundo (all the world). Outside Brazil, toda a gente substitutes todo mundo. Unfortunately, this isn't much of a shortcut, as the we form is by far the easiest, and the they form is still needed for objects.\nIt is also becoming common to see people dropping the final S in the nouns as it happens in French. So words like \"as casas\" are spoken as \"as casa\". However, in written form, that is not accepted.\n\n\nOther pronouns\nIt is very common (though technically incorrect) to use ele/a as the object pronoun for \"it.\"  Eu encontrei ele.  I found it.  If the \"it\" is intangible, best to change to the Portuguese genderless word for \"this.\"  Amo muito tudo isso.  I'm loving it.\n\neu (think of the A in \"say\", Aw)\nI\ntu (too)\nyou (informal, with incorrectly conjugated verbs. Semi-formal in some northern and northeastern regional accents, but seldom used elsewhere)\nele (A-lee)\nhe, it (m)\nela (homophonic to Ella Fitzgerald)\nshe, it (f)\nn\u00f3s (noise)\nwe\nv\u00f3s (voise)\nyou \u2014 plural (nowadays, only found on ancient and biblical texts)\neles (A-lease)\nthey, them  (mixed gender ok)\nelas (EH-lass)\nthey, them (all females/feminine)\n\n\nAvoid confusion with third person possessives\nPossessives are used like the definite articles (o,a, os, as) and are genderized by what is being possessed\u2014not who possesses them (as in English his/her).  Also, the definite article precedes the possessive in most dialects. (The main exception is Northeast Brazil, including Salvador, Bahia.)\nBeware, seu(s) and sua(s) can either mean your (second person), or his/her/their (third person).  The default is the second person.  Only if there is no possibility that it could belong to \"you\" is the use in the third person allowed.  (Exception: if the tu or v\u00f3s forms are being used, then seu/sua become the 3rd person and teu/tua or vosso/vossa are used instead .) Sua boca = your mouth.  Seu carro = your car. But if you don't have a car, then it means \"his or her car.\"  If you do have a car, and they want to talk about someone else's car, then they have to say o carro dele (the car of his), or o carro dela (the car of hers).  Notice that dele/dela (unlike regular possessives) are based on who possesses them (like English). This can be very confusing and requires practice.\n\na sua namorada     his girlfriend   Assuming she's not your girlfriend (spoken by another person), as this would have priority unless tu (i.e. teu/tua) is being used.\nNote the feminine possessive pronoun sua becomes the masculine his in English\n\na namorada dele     literally: the girlfriend of his\nIn this case, le is masculine.  Normally translated as just \"his girlfriend.\"\n\n\nVerbs\nThis topic is much too complex for a phrasebook. In general though, infinitive verbs (i.e. as found in the dictionary)  end in _ar, _er, and _ir (like Spanish) plus there's one irregular infinitive p\u00f4r (to put).  A lot of the most common verbs are irregular, and must be memorized (except in the we form, most of the time). Voc\u00ea, ele, ela, (and usually tu in Brazil -- see above) share the same verb set, as do (separately) voc\u00eas, eles, and elas.  By not using the second person, you also avoid having to change verbal commands when switching from affirmative to negative: (you) go v\u00e1, (you) don't go  n\u00e3o v\u00e1, but with tu it's vai (affirmative) and n\u00e3o v\u00e1s (negative) which is more complicated.\n\n\nPronunciation guide\nPortuguese has both nasal vowels and reduced vowels. Nearly everyone struggles to learn them correctly. If you don't reduce the vowels, you will still be understood, but sound over-enunciating. If you don't nasalize the vowels, you can easily be misunderstood: m\u00e3o means \"hand\", while mau means \"bad.\" So, be extra careful not to ouch the \u00e3o sound. For starters, try something in between English no and now for n\u00e3o (which means English no). Start practicing with words whose preceding consonant doesn't have much lip movement.  For example, n\u00e3o is easier than p\u00e3o (bread).  A good native pronunciation of this diphthong will take lots of listening and practice.  The nasals are transcribed as \"ng\", but don't pronounce \"ng\" as a consonant.\nBrazilian and Luso (European Portuguese) pronunciation differ, and within Brazil, there are regional differences as well. The Brazilian variant used here is generally based on the S\u00e3o Paulo pronunciation.\n\n\nVowels and accents\n\nAccentuation\nStatistically speaking, most Brazilian Portuguese words are paroxytones (stressed on the second-to-last syllable). If in doubt, remember this. Proparoxytones (third-to-last syllable), such as \u00faltimo (OOL-chee-moo, last) and pr\u00f3ximo (PRAW-see-moo, next), are very rare and will always bear an accent. Oxytones (last syllable) such as the male names Jos\u00e9 (zhoo-ZED, mouth open), Jo\u00e3o (zhoo-AWNG), Tom\u00e9 (tom-MET, mouth open), Lu\u00eds (lew-EES), Andr\u00e9 (unDREAD, with a short Spanish \"El Rey\" R, and the mouth open), Valdir (vow-JEER), Cau\u00e3 (kow-AHM, mouth open), Sim\u00e3o (see-MOWNG) and Iber\u00ea (ee-bay-RAY, with a short Spanish \"El Rey\" R, and the mouth open) are often clearly marked as well. If you encounter tricky words such as the lawyer's term ac\u00f3rd\u00e3o (ah-CORE-down), remember that the stress is marked by the acute accent, not the tilde.\nSimilar to Spanish: Words ending in -a, -e, -o, -m, or -s are stressed on the next to the last syllable. Words ending in any consonant except -m or -s are stressed on the last syllable. (Portuguese words end in m instead of n.)\nDissimilar to Spanish: Words ending in -i and -u are stressed on the last syllable. This includes the nasal vovels -im and -um. (The final -m is not pronounced as a consonant here.)\nExceptions to the above will have an accent mark. This is why the word t\u00e1xi is accented in Portuguese, but not in Spanish.\nWhile in many languages, the accent mark indicates the stress, and the vowel used indicates the sound, Portuguese sometimes reverses this concept (though not in the same word). The accent mark shortens the vowel sound, and which of two vowels a word ends with determines the stress, but both have the same sound.  However, accent marks have priority in determining which syllable is stressed.\nWords ending in -e and -i have the same sound (ee), but -e is stressed on the next to the last syllable, and -i is stressed on the last syllable. The diphthong ei is used for the long \"a\" (as in weigh) sound at the end of a stressed syllable.\nWords ending in -o and -u have the same sound (oo), but -o is stressed on the next to the last syllable, and -u is stressed on the last syllable. The diphthong ou is used for the long \"o\" (as in four) sound at the end of a stressed syllable.\nVowels\n\na\nlike father\n\u00e3\nlike the u in the English word hum  (nasal)\ne\nlike set, say, or eight. At the end of words it is pronounced as a short ee.\nSee also the diphthong ei\n\nclosed e\nlike herd. Often spelled with an accent mark: \u00ea\n\u00e9\nlike let\ni\nlike machine\no\nUsually rounded (like in cold) except at the end of a word, when it is pronounced as a short oo, as in the English word to. See also the diphthong ou.\nopen o\nlike in hot. Also spelled \u00f3\n\u00f4\nlike in low.\n\u00f5\nsay mown or song with mouth open, end nasally\nu\nlike soup or book\n\n\nConsonants\nRegional accents have somewhat been homogenized by mass media, but still vary widely. The Luso speech's sonic trait of \"windsurfing between the vowels\", rarely unmentioned by comparative phonology scholars, is very present in the \"carioca\", \"maranhense\" and \"paraense\" regional accents. The Paulista and southern accents are very influenced by Italian and Spanish immigration, and will accordingly roll their R's; elsewhere, a more English \"H\" sound (or the French R) is used instead. The M is also nasalised at the end of words (sim, mim) and the English \"M\" sound should be dropped even if the next word begins with a vowel. In this phrasebook, it's represented by an N (the closest possible sound). Also, be careful with words containing \"Te\" and \"Ti\" (see below).\n\nb\nlike 'b' in \"bed\"\nc\nlike 'c' in \"cat\"\nce      ci\nlike in cell and civil.\n\u00e7\nlike 's' in soft  or super.   The mark below the letter \"c\" is called a cedilla in English or cedilha in Portuguese. It is used to force the soft C before vowels other than E or I.\nd\nlike 'd' in \"dog\".  Like 'j' in \"jump\" when before an \"i\" or \"e\"\nf\nlike 'f' in \"father\"\ng\nlike 'g' in \"good\". Same as the d above, the letter is never softened between vowels as in Spanish. Example: foguete (foo-GHETT-chee, rocket)\nge      gi\nlike 's' in pleasure\nh\nSilent. See Common digraphs below and r and rr for the English \"h\" sound.  Note: many Spanish words starting with this silent \"H\" begin with \"F\" in Portuguese (and in other Romance languages) such as \"hacer\" v.s \"fazer\" (to do).\nj\nlike 's' in pleasure\nk\nFound only in words of foreign origin, so pronounce accordingly. See letters c and q for the English \"k\" sound.\nl\nlike 'l' in \"love\". The final L is vocalised (like in \"cold\").  Brazilians will make it a \"u\" sound (like in \"mal\" sounding like the English \"ow\", as in \"now\".) Unlike English, words ending in L are normally stressed on the final syllable. Example: capital (cah-pee-TAU)\nm...\nlike 'm' in \"mother\".\n...m\nNasalizes the preceding vowel, and is dropped at the end of a word.\nn\nlike nice. Nasalizes the preceding vowel and is silent when followed by a consonant. (See Common digraphs below.)\np\nlike 'p' in \"pig\"\nq\nlike \"unique\". Qu is usually followed by e   or i   as a way to get the k sound. Words with qua will sound just as 'qua' in the English word \"quack\".\nr...\nlike 'h' in \"help\", only harder.  See also RR in Common Digraphs below.  It's often pronounced like a Spanish J.\n...r\nlike 'r' in \"Harry\".\n...r...\nlike the Spanish 'r'.\nExamples:\n        fresta (FRES-tah)   a loophole    \n        hora (OH-rah)   hour, time\n\ns\nlike \"hiss\" at the beginning of words, \"haze\" between vowels, \"sure\" in final position/before consonants in Rio de Janeiro, or as s elsewhere (like the regular plural ending sound in English).\nt\nlike 't' in \"top\"\n...te    (if unstressed, i.e. no accent mark)   \nte + a...  (the 'a' is pronounced in the next syllable)  \nti   (in any syllable)  \n        like 'chee' in cheese  \nNote this is completely different from Spanish  \n\nExamples:\n        teatro (chee-AHT-roh)   theatre \n        tipo (CHEE-po)   type    \n        rotina (ho-CHEE-nah)   routine  \n        assisti (ah-sist-CHEE)   I watched/helped/attended  \n        teste (TES-chee)   test  \n        at\u00e9 (ah-TEH)   until\n\nv\nlike 'v' in \"victory\"\nw\nFound only in words of foreign origin, so pronounce accordingly. Mostly pronounced as 'v' (Volkswagen) or 'u' (Wilson).\nx\nlike \"box\", \"shoe\", \"zip\" or even \"yes\". The correct pronunciation of the X is not easy to deduce.  It is usually pronounced like sh before a vowel, and \"ks\" if preceding another consonant (but not always).\ny\nFound only in words of foreign origin, so pronounce accordingly. The digraph lh sounds like a \"ly\". (see Common digraphs below)\nz\nlike 'z' in \"zebra,\" or like a soft s when final (\"paz\", \"luz\")\n\n\nCommon diphthongs\nTwo vowels together not listed as diphthongs usually means a hiato, or syllable split.  Example: ia in Bahia (bah-EE-ah).  Any accent mark (not counting the tilde such as \u00e3o and \u00f5e) will split a diphthong into two regular vowels (see above).\n\nam\nsame as \u00e3 and \u00e2, but unstressed      andam (AHN-downg)   they walk (nasal)\nai\nlike bike (often equivalent to Spanish 'AY')        praia   beach\na\u00ed   (with an accent)\nNot a diphthong; just a, (new syllable), stressed i     sa\u00edda (sah-EE-dah) exit\n\u00e3o\nsimilar to uwng (u as in cup)       d\u00e3o    they give (nasal)\nao\nused only in contractions, and the same sound as au below\nau\nlike house        Manaus   THE city in the Amazon River\nei\nlike say (best equivalent to Spanish 'E')      meio (MAY-oo)   half.\neu\nthe e vowel (similar to the A in \"say\") plus a w semivowel, very unheard in English       Europa   Europe\nem\nlike reign     viagem   travel or journey; Bel\u00e9m (bay-LEIGN) do Par\u00e1 (nasal).\n\u00f3i\nlike boy       constr\u00f3i   he constructs\noi\nlike the British Oi!       oito   eight\nom\nsame as \u00f5, but closing the mouth with a brief M afterwards;      som    sound  (nasal)\nou\nas in own    false diphthong   (pronounced the same as the Portuguese vowel '\u00d4')     sou (s\u00f4)    I am   Do not pronounce as \"OY \u2009\" as in Spanish. Doing so is portu\u00f1ol and will mark you as a gringo.\n\u00f5e\nnasal oi     ele p\u00f5e   he puts; Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es (nasal)\num\nlike room      algum some (nasal)\n\n\nCommon digraphs\nch\nlike machine  (sh sound)  Completely different from Spanish. In Brazil, letter t when followed by i or final e  produces the Spanish & English \"ch\" sound (see above).\nExample:\n        chuva (SHOO-vah)   rain\n\nlh\nlike million  (equivalent to Spanish LL)  Note:  Spanish words starting with \"LL\" very often convert to \"CH\" (with the sh sound) in Portuguese (see above)\nExample:\n        velho (VEL-yo)   old\n\n...nh...\nlike canyon  (equivalent to Spanish \u00d1 and NI, but note that \u00d1 most often becomes just N in Portuguese)\nExamples:\n        banho (BAN-yo)   bath;   piranha (pee-RAHN-yah) man-eating fish, also pejorative term for \"prostitute\"\n\n...nr...\nthe r is pronounced like help\nExample:\n        honra (ON-ha)   honor\n\n...rr...\nIn Brazil, like help  (same as R at the beginning of a word).\nExample:\n        cachorro  (cah-SHOW-ho)   dog   \n\n...ss...\nprevents the S becoming Z between vowels.\nExamples:\n        assado (ah-SAH-doo, roasted); casado (cah-ZAH-doo, married) / cassado (cah-SAH-doo, debarred from office)\n\n\nEuropean vs. Brazilian Portuguese\nSee also: Portuguese phrasebook\nBesides pronunciation differences, there are also significant lexical differences between European and Brazilian Portuguese. As an example, Brazilian Portuguese only uses voc\u00ea as the singular second person pronoun, while European Portuguese distinguishes between the casual tu and the polite voc\u00ea.\nThe table below provides some common words that differ between the two varieties.\n\nThe numbering system is also different: Portugal uses the long scale, while Brazil uses the short scale.\n\n\nPhrase list\nTo ask a question in Portuguese use rising intonation to distinguish it from a statement.  This will seem natural as English also uses rising intonation in questions, but Portuguese has no equivalent for Do...?, Did...?, Don't...?, etc.\nAlso, note in the following example that voc\u00ea (you) -- not tem (have) -- is the first word in the question. Without the question mark, it is no different than a statement. Reversing the first two words (as is often done in Spanish and English) is irrelevant in Portuguese.\n\n\nExample\n(Do) you have a battery for this?\nVoc\u00ea tem uma pilha para isto?  (voh-SAY teng U-mah PEEL-yah PAH-rah EES-toh?)\n\n\nBasics\n\nGood Morning (lit. Good Day)\nBom dia. (bon JEE-ah)\nGood Afternoon\nBoa tarde. (BOW-ah TAR-jee)\nGood Evening / Good Night\nBoa noite.

(said by a woman)\nObrigada. (ob-ree-GAH-dah) lit. \"I'm obliged\"\nHow are you?\nComo est\u00e1? (KOH-moh es-TAH?) or Como vai voc\u00ea? (KOH-moh vahy voh-SAY?)\nAre you all right?\nTudo bem? (TOO-do BENG?) or Tudo bom? (bon)\nFine, thank you.\nBem, obrigado/a (BENG, ob-ree-GAH-doo/dah). Also, you can informally say \"All well/good\", Tudo bem/bom.\nEverything is OK. (Lit. \"All is well\")\nTudo bem (TOO-do BENG. TOO-do oKAY works just as fine).\nWhat is your name? (Lit. \"How are you called?\")\nComo se chama? (KOH-moh se SHA-ma?)\nWhat is your name? (Literal)\nQual \u00e9 o seu nome? (kwahl eh oh SAY-oo NOH-mee?)\nMy name is ______ .\nMeu nome \u00e9 ______ . (mehoo NOM-ee ey _____ .)\nNice to meet you.\nMuito prazer (em conhec\u00ea-lo). (MOOY-to prah-ZEHR eng koh-nye-SEH-lo) The final part is dropped in informal speech.\nPlease (Lit. \"As a favor\")\nPor favor. (pohr fah-VOHR)\nYou're welcome (Lit. \"For nothing\")\nDe nada. (je NAH-dah)\nYes.\nSim. (SIN(G))\nNo.\nN\u00e3o. (NAWN(G))\nRemember the Portuguese \"no\" doesn't mean a negation as in English and Spanish\u2014but rather \"in the\" as a contraction of em + o (Spanish en el). Such contractions are common in Portuguese. N\u00e3o falo ingl\u00eas no Brasil. I don't speak English in Brazil.\nNo (not any) + noun\nNenhum(a) (neh-NYOONG(-ah))\nExcuse me. (getting attention)\nCom licen\u00e7a (kong lee-SEN-sa)\nExcuse me. (begging pardon)\nDesculpe-me. (dees-KUL-pee-mee; Brazilians often shorten it to \"Desculpa\", dees-KUL-pah)\nI'm sorry.\nDesculpe.

(DEY-sheh meh eng PIZE) rhymes with \"size\"\nDon't touch me!\nN\u00e3o me toque! (NOWNG meh TOH-keh!)\nI'll call the police.\nV\u00f4 chamar a pol\u00edcia. (VOU-oo shah-MAH a poh-LEE-see-ah)\nPolice!\nPol\u00edcia! (poh-LEE-see-ah!)   The second syllable is stressed, unlike Spanish. \"Polic\u00eda\" is portu\u00f1ol.\nStop! Thief!\nP\u00e1ra!

(es-TOW feh-REE-doo/dah)\nI need a doctor.\nPreciso de um m\u00e9dico.
