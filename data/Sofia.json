  "extract": "Sofia (\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f) is the capital of Bulgaria. It is also the biggest city in the country with about 2 million citizens (including suburbs). Today, Sofia is a dynamic European capital, distinguished by its unique combination of European and communist-style architecture as well as many beautiful Orthodox churches. Furthermore, it claims to be one of the few European capitals with beautiful scenery and a developed ski-resort so close to it, the Vitosha mountain.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSofia was founded around 2,500 years ago. Over the centuries, it has had several names: Serdika, Sredets and the remains of the old cities can still be viewed today. Near Sofia lies Boyana church, which is one of the most valuable memorials of Bulgarian and European culture. The church has frescoes, acclaimed by specialists as the best examples of eastern medieval art from the 13th century AD. The decline of Sofia during the Turkish Ottoman Empire was followed by the rejuvenation after the Russian liberation in 1878, when Sofia was chosen as the capital of Bulgaria at the First National Constituent Assembly, and followed by a brisk and straightforward period of construction.\n\n\nTourist information\nVisitSofia.bg, Sofia's official tourist information website. Available in several languages, including English.\n1 Main tourist information centre, 22 Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd (in the underpass of Sofia University, under the intersection south of the main building), \u260f +359 2 491 83 44.

A small reading room/library in a glass kiosk that also serves as a tourist information point. (You can get a library membership by donating at least one book, but the books are only in Bulgarian.) (updated Jun 2024)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Sofia Airport (\u041b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f SOF  IATA) (9 km east of the city center). It is the busiest airport in Bulgaria, with annual passenger traffic of approximately 4 million.   \nOver 20 airlines operate service to/from Sofia, with direct flights to/from Athens, Paris, Vienna, London, Rome, Amsterdam, Munich, Warsaw and other European cities. There are also domestic flights from Varna and Burgas.\nAlong with traditional carriers, some low-cost companies serving Bulgaria are EasyJet (to/from London-Gatwick, Madrid, Manchester) and Wizz Air  (to/from Paris-Beauvais, Barcelona, Brussels-Charleroi, Dortmund, Eindhoven, London-Luton, Milan-Bergamo, Rome-Fiumicino, Valencia) and RyanAir. Bulgaria Air, the national carrier operates service to/from Alicante, Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Bucharest, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Larnaca, London (Gatwick & Heathrow), Madrid, M\u00e1laga, Manchester, Palma de Mallorca, Paphos, Paris, Rome, Skopje, Tel Aviv, Tirana, Tripoli, Valencia, Vienna and Z\u00fcrich.\nBudget airlines including EasyJet, Eurowings and Wizz Air operate from Terminal 1, while the traditional carriers including Bulgaria Air but also Ryanair operate from Terminal 2. There are shops, cafes, post offices, ATMs, and money exchange offices at the airport. For more details, see the airport website.\nThere is a free shuttle bus operating between Terminals 1 and 2 every 15\u201330 minutes between 05:00 and 23:00. Outside of those hours, a free shuttle bus can be requested at the information desk or you can use Busses #84 or 184 depending on direction (see below). After midnight you might asked to book a cab for such ride.\nTo travel between the airport and the city centre:\n\nSofia Metro Line 4 (Yellow) operates service to the airport between 05:30 and 24:00. The stop is next to Terminal 2 (leave the building and go east). The journey to the city centre takes 20\u201330 minutes. The journey to the central bus station takes approximately 35 minutes and a transfer is required. A single ticket costs 1.60 \u043b\u0432. You no longer need an extra ticket for each piece of large luggage. You can also buy a day ticket for all modes of public transport for 4 \u043b\u0432. The access gates as well as some ticket vending machines also accept credit cards and payment apps such as Apple Pay.\nPublic Busses #84 and 184 operates service between both terminals and the city centre. The journey takes 30\u201340 minutes. Tickets can be purchased from news stands or ticket machines in the airport as well as by contactless payment aboard. A single ticket costs 1.60 \u043b\u0432. An extra ticker for large luggage is no longer needed. The bus makes a stop at Orlov Most (Sofia University metro station), where you can transfer to the metro.\nTaxi service from the airport is regulated. OK Supertrans AD is the only contracted taxi operator from the airport. It is best to request a taxi either from the taxi stand to the right when you leave the arrivals area or the taxi office right adjacent to the exit from the baggage reclaim. Beware of touts offering taxi service as well as non-contracted taxis with the fake \"OK\" logo which usually wait in front of the terminal instead on the official taxi rank besides it. A taxi to the city center will cost approximately 15 \u043b\u0432. The regulated taxi fare is: initial fee of 0.70 \u043b\u0432, price per km 0.79 \u043b\u0432 in the day or 0.90 \u043b\u0432 at night, price per minute of stay of 0.22 \u043b\u0432, price for ordering a taxi via phone of 0.50 \u043b\u0432. You can also use the Ridenow Taxi app.\n\n\nBy bus\nEurolines Bulgaria is the largest operator of international buses to/from Bulgaria. Buses operate to/from Belgrade (5 hr, \u20ac23) and other cities in Serbia, Vienna (15\u00bd hr, \u20ac59) and other cities in Austria, Paris (36 hr, \u20ac120) and other cities in France, Berlin (28 hr, \u20ac110) and other cities in Germany, Budapest (11-13 hr, \u20ac48), and Prague (21 hr, \u20ac63).\nMATPU 96 is the largest operator of buses in Bulgaria. The schedule is available in Bulgarian and English online. Buses operate several times per day from Skopje (5\u00bd hr, \u20ac15).\nAnother company running between Skopje and Sofia is Kaleia Travel with two departure per day, 07:00 and 17:30 (both ways). Ticket booth no. 10 in the main terminal building. 40 \u043b\u0432.\n\n2 Central Bus Station (Tsentralna Avtogara, \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430), bul. \"Knyaginya Maria-Luiza\" 100 (in the north part of the city centre; on the same large boulevard that passes through Independence Sqr and Lion's Bridge). Serves both national and international lines, but mainly the former. Schedules and fares are available in Bulgarian online. Next to the Central Railway Station, so it's served by the same metro station on Metro Line 2 (Blue). Also accessible via busses \u2116 78, 85, 213, 305, 404, 413, and trams \u2116 1, 3, 6, 7.   (updated Feb 2024)\n3 International Bus Station / Bus Station Serdika (\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430) (right between the Central Railway Station and the Central Bus Station). A parking lot with two low buildings with ticket offices on the sides. Used by international lines. The large Bulgarian company Union-Ivkoni also uses it for some of its national lines, e.g. to Pernik, Radomir and Kyustendil. (updated Feb 2024)\nThree smaller bus stations serve national and local lines:\n\n4 Bus Station West (Ovcha Kupel) (Avtogara Zapad, \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434 (\u041e\u0432\u0447\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0435\u043b)), bul. \"Ovcha Kupel\" 1 (in the Ovcha Kupel neighbourhood, several kilometres south-west of the city centre). Mainly used by smaller companies serving local lines around Sofia (and the appearance matches), but also to Blagoevgrad, Dupnitsa and Kyustendil. Accessible by trams \u2116 4 and 11, and buses \u2116 103, 107 and 260. The nearest metro station, Ovcha Kupel on Line 3 (Green), is 1.4 km (0.87 mi) north along the same boulevard. (updated Feb 2024)\n5 Bus Station South (\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u042e\u0433), bul. \"Dragan Tsankov\" 23 (in the Iztok neighbourhood, several kilometres south-east of the city centre - beyond the Borisova Garden). A small prefab building huddled under the overpass where Dragan Tsankov Blvd goes over Samokov Blvd. Buses to Samokov and Velingrad. Accessible via buses \u2116 67 and 413 (\"Interpred\" stop), as well as metro station Zholio Kyuri (Joliot-Curie) on Lines 1 and 4 (Red, Yellow) - 400 m/yd to the north of Bus Station South along the same boulevard.  (updated Feb 2024)\n6 Bus Station Poduyane (\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u044f\u043d\u0435) (between the neighbourhoods of Poduyane and Suha Reka, close to Georgi Asparuhov Stadium, several kilometres north-east of the city centre). Another questionably looking shack. Buses to Botevgrad, Etropole and Pravets north of Sofia (but there are also some that start from the Central Bus Station). Accessible via trolleybus \u2116 1 and buses \u2116 78, 79, 90, 100, 120 (but only 79 stops right in front of it). The nearest metro station is Hadzhi Dimitar, the end point of Line 3 (Green) - a 10-15 min walk; follow the large Vladimir Vazov Blvd east along the river until you reach a large intersection, then make sure you cross to the eastern side and head south - look to your left for the bus station's parking lot. (updated Feb 2024)\n\n\nBy train\nSofia is perhaps the largest railway hub in the country. A list of all the available daily trains would resemble a description of Bulgaria's railway network. Nevertheless: \nA major line through North Bulgaria connects Sofia to Varna on the Black Sea coast (8-8\u00bd hr, sleeper cars available on overnight trains). It passes through Shumen (about 7 hr), Targovishte (6\u00bd hr) and Pleven (3-3\u00be hr). Off the line, Ruse (about 7 hr) and Veliko Tarnovo (5-6\u00bd hr) require changing at Gorna Oryahovitsa. In the North-West, Vidin (5-6\u00bd hr) and Vratsa (2-3 hr) require changing at Mezdra. The line crosses the Balkan Mountains through the scenic Iskar Gorge, about an hour away from Sofia, so keep your camera ready.\nSouth of the Balkan Mountains, another major line connects Sofia with Plovdiv (2\u00bd-3 hr) and with Burgas on the Black Sea (7-8 hr, sleeper cars on late trains). There's also the smaller Sub-Balkan Line which runs below the southern slopes of the mountains, through the Sub-Balkan Valleys. The network ensures direct trains from Yambol (6-6\u00bd hr), Stara Zagora (5 hr), Svilengrad by the Greek/Turkish border (5 hr), and Pazardzhik (2-2\u00bd hr).\nAnother line descends south from Sofia towards the Greek border, with direct trains from Pernik (40 min), Kyustendil by the North Macedonian Border (3 hr), Blagoevgrad (2-3 hr), Sandanski, and Petrich (4 hr). Further timetables can be found on the BDZ website (in English).\nThere are several train stations and stops in Sofia, but of interest to travellers are mostly two. Since May 2024, due to track renovations, most trains to destinations in Northern Bulgaria arrive at/depart from Sofia North station. This most notably affects some of the \"tourist trains\" to Varna (a couple direct ones remain). Nevertheless, it's still possible to buy tickets for those destinations at Sofia Central, as there are shuttle trains from Sofia Central to Sofia North, and you'll have to change trains there. Renovations are expected to last about a year.\n\n7 Sofia Central Station (\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u044a\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f/Tsentralna zhelezopatna gara Sofiya/Tsentralna Gara) (on the northern end of the city centre). The station can be somewhat confusing. Domestic departures go from the main terminal and that is where you can buy tickets for domestic travel. If you want to travel to an international destination, use ticket windows 21 or 22 on ground floor. It's opened 06:30-18:15. They speak some English and to book a ticket, you will need your passport. They only take cash. Platforms can be accessed from the main floor down the escalators at the far left corner. Platform numbering is somewhat confusing: Roman numerals indicate the platform number (I to VI), and Arabic numerals (1 to 12) indicate the actual track. Each platform is divided into East and West. Departures and arrivals are indicated on reliable electronic panels, but, beware, they indicate the track number, not the platform!   (updated Dec 2021)\n8 Sofia North Station (\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440, Sofia Sever) (about 3 km (1.9 mi) north-west of Sofia Central: follow Knyaginya Maria Luiza Bld west, then Rozhen Bld north, turn east at the tram tracks T-intersection). A secondary station used by few passengers under normal circumstances. There's a tram turnaround in front of the station; tram lines 3 and 27 start there and pass through Sofia Central Station and its public transport hub (incl. a metro station). Alternatively, you can ride them further: Tram 3 stops at Pirotska Str (close to the Women's Market) and Vazrazhdane Sqr (close to Nezavisimost Sqr and Mall of Sofia); Tram 27 stops at Lion's Bridge, Sveta Nedelya Sqr (close to Nezavisimost Sqr), Vitosha Blvd, and the National Palace of Culture. You can also use Bus 413 to get to Sofia Central.  (updated May 2024)\n\n\nInternational\nFrom Romania, a train runs daily from Bucharest at noon, taking ten hours; the return train leaves Sofia at 09:00. June to Sept this is a through-train, Oct-May you have to change at Ruse on the border. There's no longer an overnight train.\nFrom Turkey, a sleeper train departs Istanbul Halkal\u0131 at 21:40, running via Edirne, Kapikule on the border where you get out for passport control, and Plovdiv, to reach Sofia by 09:00. The eastbound train leaves Sofia at 18:30 to reach Istanbul for 05:40. Fares are quoted in euros: in 2022 you pay \u20ac31.68 for the basic single from Istanbul. Add \u20ac10 for a couchette, \u20ac15 for a bed in a shared 2-person cabin or \u20ac35 for the entire cabin.\n\n\nBy car\nThe motorway network in Bulgaria is still under construction.\nAccess to Bulgaria's capital is via several entry points:\n\nFrom the north (Vidin) & south (Thessaloniki) via E79.\nFrom the east - via Thrace Highway E80/A1.\nFrom the west - from the Bulgarian-Serbian border point of Kalotina.\nThe following motorways heading for Sofia are already in service:\n\nA1 connects Sofia to Burgas and the Black Sea coast, as well as Istanbul.\nA2 ends about 80 km from each city; the rest of the route is a regular 2-lane road. Extensions into the cities are planned.\nA3 is planned to be from Sofia to Thessaloniki, about 2/3 of the route is already in service.\nComing from North Macedonia, via Kyustendil the roads are relatively good but driving within speed limits would avoid you much hassle caused either by traffic police, or road conditions. From Central Europe you can drive almost the whole length on highways (via Slovenia-Croatia-Serbia or Hungary-Serbia), with only the last 100 km between Ni\u0161 in Southern Serbia and Sofia being heavily trafficked mountain roads around the Nishava ravine in not the best shape.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy public transport\n\nSofia has a well-developed, cheap, and efficient public transport system that consists of buses, trolleybuses, trams, and subway lines. The transport network can be confusing for visitors who do not know it well, but there is a journey planner. The public transport operates from 05:00\u201323:00. Night transport is back since November 1st 2023, and as of June 2024 there are three night lines: N1 (zh.k. Lyulin 0650) to Mladost 4 0669), N2 (Obelya quarter 0874 to zh.k. Studentski grad 1694), and N3 (zh.k. Levski G 2430 to zh.k. Ovcha Kupel 2 0684). Note: the four digit codes are the codes of the stops themselves. \nThe price of a single metro ticket is 1.60 \u043b\u0432 only paid in the local currency cash, while a bus/tram/trolleybus ticket is 2 \u043b\u0432. There are also daily travel cards (4 \u043b\u0432). Tickets and daily cards can be bought at most newspaper stands especially ones adjacent to public transport stops. If you can't find any, you can always buy tickets from the driver. Validate your card/ticket as soon as you get on the bus/tram/trolleybus. The inspectors rarely understand English and you might have problems with them if you travel without a ticket. Inspectors ambush and board buses and trams in groups (and their attitude is generally not friendly at all), sometimes accompanied by police, and make no exceptions. The fine is 40 \u043b\u0432.\nTickets can also be purchased using contactless bank cards and payment apps such as Apple and Google Pay (Visit Sofia, which might be the easiest solution for foreign visitors. In the metro, the ticket gates have a contactless symbol indicating the location of the reader (it's on the left side, not the right). On buses and trams, there are blue electronic readers with the same contactless symbol. Contactless purchases will be capped to the cost of the daily travel pass. Visit Sofia states: \"If you travel more than three times during the day, from 16:30 to 00:00, including a combination of ground transport, the system automatically charges a daily pass price of 4 \u043b\u0432, regardless of how many times you used public transport. The only condition is to use the same bank card throughout the day and for one person only.\"\nThe day ticket needs to be shown to the person at the ticket office before every metro trip, as they are supposed to check the date stamp (manually applied at the time of sale) before activating the ticket barriers to accept it. If you are staying for 4 or more days, or 3+ days and arriving directly in the city centre, you can also buy a 3-day ticket on an electronic card from the public transport offices (not from metro stations or at the airport) for 10 \u043b\u0432 + 2 \u043b\u0432 card fee.\nThere are 15 tram lines, 9 trolley lines, 93 bus lines and 4 metro lines. Some of the buses cover the area outside the city centre including neighboring villages. Useful routes are bus #84 from both terminals of the airport to the center; from the train/bus station to Orlov most - bus #213 or #214 or tram #1, #7 and #18 to Vitosha Street and Sv. Nedelya Square, #1, #6, #7 to the National Palace of Culture, #18 to Slaveykov square or #6 to Macedonia square. \n\n\nOn foot\nStreets have adequate tiled pavements, especially in the city centre. However, they are frequently uneven and potholed, and walking is further made difficult by parked cars, street vendors and cafes. Except for areas in the very centre, pavements rarely have slopes for wheelchair access or designated lanes for bicycle riders. Pedestrian crossings are numerous and are relatively respected by drivers. Use pedestrian underpasses to cross large intersections, though avoid ones in the suburbs as these are usually derelict.\n\n\nBy mini-bus\nMini-buses (marshrutki) stop if you just wave a hand and are usually fast way to go somewhere without need to change the car, but they aren't common anymore. You pay to the driver when you get on the car. Prices are 1.50 \u043b\u0432. You must tell the driver if and when you want to get off.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis in Sofia are yellow. Taxis can be caught on the streets or can be ordered by phone, they arrive fast and are reliable. A drive inside Sofia will rarely exceed 10 \u043b\u0432 and a trip from the airport to the city center 8-15 \u043b\u0432.\nThere are many companies offering taxi services, some of them are OK Supertrans taxi (973 2121), \u20ac1 Taxi, \"962-22-26\", Yellow Taxi (91119) and Radio CV Taxi (91263) with fares around 0.80 \u043b\u0432/km. Some taxi companies have smartphone apps available that allow you to register and order taxis to your specific address in real time, thus eliminating the risk of falling prey to scams. As of June 2017, Yellow Taxi has the most user-friendly app for foreigners.\nThere are some taxis trying to imitate the most popular ones but with outrageous prices (up to 5.90 \u043b\u0432/km) so check before you board, these taxis usually hang around hotels and tourist spots picking on unsuspecting customers, The general rule is that if a taxi driver comes to you and offers you a drive, never accept it because they will try to rip you off.\nTaxi drivers may not stop if you hail them on the street and often don't have much change, so plan accordingly (or leave tips!)\n\n\nBy car\nRenting a car is possible, but not necessarily a good idea if your plans are restricted to visiting only Sofia and not travelling elsewhere in the country. Driving here can be strenuous for those with less experience behind the wheel - be prepared for traffic jams and disorganized traffic. Those of you who plan on visiting more of the country can rent a car from a local company (much cheaper than the big brands) or use a broker as some of the local companies do not even have websites.\nIf you need to park your car, you are recommended to do it in a paid guarded lot. Parking in the center is difficult and you may be parked illegally without knowing it; foreign license plates may attract unwelcome attention of Bulgarian police and of criminals. Even if there are other cars parked in the area, double check that there are no signs or pavement markings prohibiting it. Parking in the central city area on working days is paid, it is divided in a so-called Blue Zone (\"\u0421\u0438\u043d\u044f \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430\") \u2014 2 \u043b\u0432 per hour, and a Green Zone (\"\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0430\") \u2014 1 \u043b\u0432 per hour. If you have a Bulgarian mobile number, you can also pay by SMS: send the vehicle registration plate number to \"1302\" for the \"Green zone\" or 1303 for the \"Blue zone\". This will charge parking for an hour through your phone bill. Five minutes before the prepaid time is up you will receive a warning sms. You can either send another message for another hour or move your car.\nPay attention to trams or buses stopping in the middle of the road. If you see a stopped tram or bus on your left, you must stop and let the passengers get on/off, according to the Bulgarian traffic code. Failing to stop in this manner may be very dangerous.\nDriving with your lights on is compulsory, day and night, all year long.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nSofia is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with the big park zones ideal for biking. Slow traffic in downtown is perfect for cycling. On a bike you will save time and will enjoy sport activity. Sofia also has a few bike paths around the downtown area and in districts such as Mladost, Nadezhda, Hipodruma. Be careful as many cars double park and may open doors without noticing you. Rent a bike) Bike rental operates 10:00-20:00 (April to November). Discover Sofia by bike map or joint to an experienced bike guide.\n\n\nSee\n\nSofia is one of the oldest cities in Europe and has ancient ruins throughout the city center. In the administrative center of Sofia, the streets are covered with a specific yellow pavement. It was laid in the beginning of the 20th century and were a present to the Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand for his wedding from the Austria-Hungarian royal family.\n\n1 Regional History Museum of Sofia, 1 Banski Sq (Behind Banya Bashi Mosque), \u260f +359 2 985 44 55.

In the city, there are 7 independent mineral water springs. One of the springs is in the central area of the city and is accessible for everybody - cross the square behind the mosque, next to TSUM (the intersection of Iskar and Ekzarh Yosif streets).\n\n2 Sofia Public Mineral Baths.

If you love the music, there are Mac computers in most of the rooms where you can pick something out of the playlist. Have a game of chess. There is also a Cinema room, if there is nothing running just go in, pick a movie out of the list and start the projection.

Nevertheless, you should avoid poorly lit areas and use your common sense. Avoid the area around the central Bus and Rail Station, Maria Luiza Blvd, the dark areas of the city parks and the Lions' Bridge (Lavov Most). And don't go to the Borisova garden, it is very dangerous (especially during the night). Single women and girls should be especially careful. Junkies get high in these areas, prostitutes offer their \"services\", some people might want to tempt you with touts of contraband (stolen, illegal, etc.) and/or try to mug you. These areas are also frequented by the homeless and the drunk. If your hotel is in the area you'll be alright, just don't hang around it unnecessarily. Try to act like you are familiar with the area (and familiarize yourself during the day) and look like a local. It is wise to choose a hotel/hostel in a good, central location.\nPedestrians should be careful since many Bulgarian drivers do not yield right of way to those on foot.\nDo not get into conflict with locals especially if they seem aggressive or drunk, particularly football fan groups who tend to be drunk and aggressive. Avoid wearing football shirts or scarves of the Sofia-based football teams, especially on match days.\nBe wary of petty thieves and poorer neighborhoods, as pick pocketing and thefts are common. If you are approached by locals trying to sell stolen goods, give you directions or bother you exercise caution.\nIf you get in legal trouble with some of the locals, the Bulgarian police and judiciary may not protect you adequately because of corruption and nepotism.\nBe careful with taxis, make sure you check the prices first before you get in (the fare is per km and it should be something like 0.79 \u043b\u0432 during the day and 0.90 \u043b\u0432 during the night, avoid taxis that display their fare as above 1.00 \u043b\u0432), also make sure the taxi has the driver's card on the front with his name.\nBanks exchange most currency so there is usually no need to use exchange offices which often offer a poor rate, ignore anyone on the street wanting to change money; you will get an awful exchange rate, or a handful of fake banknotes.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nEmbassies\n 4 Armenia, ul. \"Zagorichane\" 3, \u260f +359-2 9461272, +359 2 9461273, armbulgariaembassy@mfa.am.
