  "extract": "Cear\u00e1 is a state in Northeast Brazil. Traditionally one of the poorest in the country, certain regions have developed almost beyond recognition over the last 20 years, mostly from tourism and light manufacturing. The population is closing in on 9 million, of which almost a third lives in the capital, Fortaleza.\nThe coast is quite different from the inland. While the state features a range of nice beaches, including a few of countrywide fame, the only developed destination further in is Guaramiranga.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Aquiraz\n2 Aracati\n3 Camocim , the most well preserved fishing village in the region.\n4 Canind\u00e9\n5 Canoa Quebrada Excellent nightlife and more sandstone cliffs - 2.5 hours east of Fortaleza)\n6 Caucaia\n7 Crate\u00fas\n8 Cumbuco is known as one of the best places in the world for kitesurfing.\n9 Fortaleza\n10 Guaramiranga\n11 Jijoca de Jericoacoara Rated among Brazil's top beaches.\n12 Juazeiro do Norte , -deep inland.\n13 Mundau , still not fully developed, nice beaches and dunes.\n14 Paracuru , another small cearense beach village slowly growing into a tourist destination.\n15 Reden\u00e7\u00e3o\n16 Russas \u2014 center of an agricultural region.\n17 Sobral\n18 Tatajuba\n19 Tiangu\u00e1\n20 Ubajara\n\n\nOther destinations\n Prea \u2014 wide open beach (12 km), the most reliable kitesurfing playground on earth between mid-July to mid-January.\n Ubajara National Park \u2014 caves and waterfalls in the interior of Ceara 5.5 hours west of Fortaleza\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nGet around\nGood bus connection along the main highway, with Fortaleza as the obvious hub. Scarcer to smaller town, especially at night.\nThe only air travel worth considering within the state is to between the capital and Juazeiro do Norte.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nItineraries\nTravel by beach buggy along the coast from Fortaleza to Natal, stopping in Canoa Quebrada and a couple of other spots. Typically 4 days, can be arranged with many travel agencies in both ends.\nWest from Fortaleza there are many nice beaches before hitting the most famed, Jericoacoara. Or you could stop by Sobral to get a feel of the inland. Camocim is the Brazilian fishing village, almost on the border of Piau\u00ed.\n\n\nDo\nDue to its constant breezes and otherwise stable climate, Cear\u00e1 has slowly conquered the fame of Kite Surfing Paradise. Most of the coast is suitable, but the prime destinations are Cumbuco, followed by Flecheiras.\n\n\nEat\nWhile the standard Brazilian lunch is always accompanied by rice and beans, the latter in a gravy of sorts, the cearenses prefer Bai\u00e3o de Dois. This is also made from rice and beans, only cut the gravy and add melted cheese instead.\nGo away from the coast, and panelada will appear on the menu. This is a sort of stew mostly made of tripe.\nCrab is at its most popular in this state, particularly on the beaches around Fortaleza. Most commonly served by itself, with a tray and a wooden hammer to get access to the goodies. Some would consider this more of a pastime than a meal.\nFeijao Verde is white(!) beans in a sauce of cheese and cream, and whatever else the cook chose to throw in.\nPeixe a Delicia is fish, fried bananas and cheese in a creamy sauce.\n\n\nDrink\nEven though the coconut can be found along most of the Brazilian coastline, Cear\u00e1 is the state that has arguably the most of it, and sometimes priced as low as 50 centavos cold and ready to drink.\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
