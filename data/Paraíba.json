  "extract": "Paraiba (Portuguese: Para\u00edba) is a state in Northeast Brazil. The state is a tourist and industrial hotspot; it is known for its cultural heritage, amenable climate and geographical features, ranging from the seaside beaches to the Borborema Plateau. \n\n\nCities\n\n1 Jo\u00e3o Pessoa \u2014 the state capital has beautiful historic buildings and few foreigners\n2 Campina Grande \u2014 has countrywide fame for midwinter parties, Festa Junina or S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, in June, and hosts a large out-of-season carnival, Micarande, in April, and a few rodeos throughout the year\n3 Conde \u2014 town close to the Tambaba and other beaches\n4 Sousa \u2014 known for its fossil sites (Vale dos Dinossauros)\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Vale dos Dinossauros \u2014  an area that contains many fossilized dinosaur tracks\n2 Pedra do Altar \u2014 archaeological site near the town of Barra de Santana\n\n\nUnderstand\nIt is named after the Para\u00edba river.\nThe Para\u00edba economy is largely based upon the making of shoes and other leather products, the raising of cattle for beef, and sugarcane. Pineapple, corn, and beans cultivation are also widespread. The other important economical sector in the state is tourism, especially the state urban and unspoilt beaches, ecotourism and festivals such as \"carnaval\" and \"S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o.\"\n\n\nClimate\nPara\u00edba goes through wet and dry seasons, with most of its rain falling in the first third of the year, especially in March and April. However, in the east, including the coast and the agreste mesoregion, most rainfall occurs from April to June.\nIn the entire state, the period from October to December is the hottest and driest of the year, whereas June to August is the coldest, with temperatures in some areas reaching below 20\u00b0C.\n\n\nGet in\nPresidente Castro Pinto International Airport is 8 km (5 mi) from downtown Jo\u00e3o Pessoa.\nThe BR-101 and BR-230 highways cross Para\u00edba. \n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\nFesta Junina (Saint John Festival) is celebrated on the 24th of June during the winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets. Once exclusively a rural festival, today it is largely a city festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clich\u00e9s in a spirit of jokes and good times. Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Like during Carnival, these festivities involve wearing peasant costumes, heavy drinking, fireworks display and folk dancing.\nThe four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is Carnival time in Brazil. Rich and poor alike forget their cares as they party in the streets.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
