  "extract": "The Netherlands (Dutch: Nederland) is a charming small country in the low-lying river delta of northwestern Europe. Its landscape of famously flat lands, much of it reclaimed from the sea, is dotted with windmills, blooming tulip fields and picturesque villages. The modern architecture and urban environments of quite a few cities are also becoming internationally prominent. With over 17 million people living in a relatively small area, this is a densely populated modern European country. Still, even the largest of its cities have retained elements of a laid-back, small-town atmosphere, and most are packed with historic heritage, for which there is much local pride.\nThe country is commonly referred to as Holland, but this name refers only to two of its twelve provinces and is unpopular among Dutch people who aren't from North or South Holland.\nAfter the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) that led to the country's de facto independence from Spain in 1581, the Netherlands became a great naval power and one of the world's most powerful nations in a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. Because of its naval and trading history, this small nation boasts a wealth of cultural heritage visible in many towns across the country. This period also constituted a cultural peak that produced renowned painters like Rembrandt and Vermeer. Their works and many others fill the top-class Dutch museums that attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\nOver the course of centuries, the Netherlands has gained a reputation for tolerance and progressivism: the country was the first in the world to legalise same-sex marriage and Dutch people generally have an open attitude to cannabis use and prostitution. As a founding member of the EU and NATO and host to various international courts in The Hague, the Netherlands is at the heart of international cooperation.\nWith its international airport Schiphol and its advanced network of motorways and international high speed train lines, the Netherlands is easy to reach from anywhere. Its small size, welcoming attitude and interesting sights make it a unique and easy to discover destination and a great addition to any European trip.\n\n\nRegions\nThe Netherlands is a parliamentary monarchy, administratively divided into 12 provinces (provincies). Even though the Netherlands is a small country, these provinces are relatively diverse and have plenty of cultural and linguistic differences. It is customary to divide them into four regions:\n\nThis article describes the European Netherlands. The Caribbean islands Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba are \"special municipalities\" fully integrated into the Netherlands proper. Besides the Netherlands proper, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten are constituent countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\n\nCities\nThe Netherlands has many cities and towns of interest to travellers. Below are nine of the most notable ones:\n\n1 Amsterdam \u2014 impressive architecture, lovely canals (grachten), museums and liberal attitudes\n2 Delft \u2014 historic unspoiled town with the world-famous blue and white ceramics\n3 Groningen \u2014 student city with a relaxed atmosphere and nightlife till the sun gets up\n4 The Hague (Den Haag) \u2014 the judicial capital of the world, the seat of government and the royal family\n5 Leiden \u2014 historic student city with the country's oldest university and three national museums\n6 Maastricht \u2014 fortified mediaeval city showing the different culture, style and architecture of the south\n7 Nijmegen \u2014 the oldest city in the country, known for the Four Days Marches and its large student population\n8 Rotterdam \u2014 modern architecture, good nightlife, vibrant art scene and the largest port in Europe\n9 Utrecht \u2014 historic centre, antique stores and the Rietveld-Schr\u00f6der House\n\n\nOther destinations\nThese are some interesting destinations outside of the major cities:\n\n1 Efteling \u2014 the Dutch equivalent of Disneyland, theme park with fairytale elements like elves and dwarves\n2 Hoge Veluwe National Park \u2014 perhaps the most visited national park, with heathlands, sand dunes and woodlands\n3 Keukenhof \u2014 World famous park for its flowers, with more than 800,000 visitors one of the most visited attractions in the country\n4 Kinderdijk \u2014 these windmills show the typical Dutch landscape in all its glory\n5 Schokland \u2014 old island evacuated in 1859, a well-preserved ghost village remains\n6 South Limburg \u2014 hilly green landscapes, picturesque villages, castles and orchards, Valkenburg aan de Geul is a notable destination here\n7 Texel \u2014 largest island suited for cycling, bird watching, walking, swimming and horse riding, also hosts the most important dropzone for skydiving, tandem jumps for up to 13000 feet are available\n8 Zaanse Schans \u2014 open air museum with Dutch windmills and Zaan houses\n9 Zaanstreek-Waterland \u2014 typical Dutch villages and polders with clogs, wooden houses and windmills\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Netherlands, historically the region now known as the Benelux, was part of the Holy Roman Empire until it was acquired piece by piece by the Burgundians. At the end of the Middle Ages, it became a Spanish possession. A few historic city centres and several castles from this Spanish period remain today.\nFollowing the Dutch Revolt, also known as the 80-year war, led in part by national hero William of Orange, aimed to remove Spanish king Philip II off the throne in favour of another monarch, the Netherlands proclaimed its independence as a republic in early 1588, after both the French and English allied rulers were deemed unfit of taking the throne. Independence only became official with the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster. The (first) split with Belgium came when the northern provinces (including Flanders) signed the Union of Utrecht in 1579, while the southern Netherlands, roughly modern-day Wallonia, declared their desire to keep Philip II as their monarch in the 1579 Union of Atrecht. The Netherlands grew to become one of the major economic and seafaring powers in the world during the 17th century, which is known as the Dutch Golden Age (Gouden Eeuw). During this period, many colonies were founded or conquered, including the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and New Netherland (which at its height extended along the East Coast of today's United States, from Rhode Island to the Eastern Shore of Maryland); the latter was traded with the British for Suriname in 1667.\nAfter peacefully transforming into the Batavian Republic, a sister republic of the French Empire, following the Batavian revolution of 1795, the Netherlands became a kingdom in 1806 when Emperor Napoleon appointed his brother Louis-Napoleon as 'King of Holland', which was annexed into France in 1810. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna transformed the Low Countries into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands together with modern-day Belgium under King William I, who also gained a political union over Luxembourg. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. During the liberal revolutions of 1848, a new constitution was adopted and the Netherlands became a constitutional monarchy. The personal union with Luxembourg ended in 1890 as Salic Law prohibited a female ruler.\nThe Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered a brutal invasion and occupation by neighbouring Germany in World War II. A modern, industrialised nation, the Netherlands is a large exporter of agricultural products. In 1944, the Low Countries formed the union of the Benelux in which they economically (and sometimes politically) work together. The country was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and the European Community (EC) in 1957, and participated in the introduction of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.\n\n\nAttitudes\nQuite a few travellers visit the Netherlands to enjoy its famously tolerant attitude (more or less true, especially for the centres of larger cities), which includes relaxed treatment of marijuana use, legal prostitution, a right to euthanasia under strict medical conditions, and acceptance of gays and lesbians, including the right to marry one's same-sex partner.\n\n\nReligion\nThe traditional religion of the Netherlands is the Dutch Reformed Church, a branch of Calvinism. There is also a longstanding Roman Catholic minority mostly concentrated in the southern provinces near the Belgian border. However, in modern times, the Netherlands is largely a secular society, and as of the 2023 census, the majority of Dutch people do not profess a religion.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. No matter where you go, you are never far away from civilisation. Cities can be crowded, especially in the Randstad area, where congestion is a serious problem.\nMuch of the country is flat and at or below sea level, making it an ideal place to cycle. A few individual hills may be found only at Salland, the Utrechtse Heuvelrug the Veluwe. South Limburg, the most southern tip of the country, is the only region characterised by rolling hills. This hilly nature (combined perhaps with its distinct culture) have gained it a reputation of being almost \"foreign\", and have made it a popular holiday destination for the Dutch. The countryside throughout the Netherlands is dominated by highly industrialised farming and wide grasslands. It is only because of this industrialisation that the Netherlands can be one of the largest food exporters in the world while being so densely populated.\nCycling is also a good way to discover picturesque rural landscapes, villages and windmills. While the main cities and attractions are easy to find and navigate, its rural beauty can at first seem a bit harder to find between the extensive development of the countryside. The excellent network of VVV tourist information offices are most helpful for anyone wishing to explore the Dutch provincial areas. They can also provide you with countless biking and hiking routes, especially designed to take you right along the best spots in any region.\nThe geography of the Netherlands is also famously influenced by water features. The country is criss-crossed with rivers, canals and dikes, and the beach is never far away. The western coast has extensive sandy beaches and dunes, attracting many Dutch and German visitors. Since the 17th century, about 20% of the entire country has been reclaimed from the sea, lakes, marshes and swamps. The Frisian Lakes define much of the geography of the North-West.\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe Netherlands has a temperate climate with cool summers and mild winters. Every month of the year has rainfall, with no wet or dry season. The best time to go is from May to September (daily maximum 18/19\u00b0C up to 23\u00b0C), but April and October can also see mild and sunny weather.\nIn spring, temperatures vary greatly. Frost can occur until the start of May, but temperatures exceeding 20\u00b0C are not uncommon either. The sun shines 4 to 7 hours a day on average, increasing throughout the season. Although spring is the driest season (and April is the driest month), always prepare yourself for some rain.\nIn summer, the temperature rises generally to above 20\u00b0C and frequently to 25\u00b0C. Colder weather is mostly combined with rain. Temperatures in excess of 30\u00b0C are not unknown, and occur for a few days most summers. A heat wave usually ends with a thunderstorm. The sun shines 7 hours a day on average.\nIn autumn, temperatures decrease, but in September and October, the temperature is still a pleasant 15-19\u00b0C, sometimes exceeding 25\u00b0C in September. Rain is abundant, and the number of sunshine hours decrease markedly. In November, frost is more common and temperatures at daytime fluctuates around 9\u00b0C, but freezing daytimes and snow are not unheard of. Autumn mornings are quite foggy.\nIn winter, temperatures are around 0-6\u00b0C most of the time, although frosty periods occur each winter, generally down to -5\u00b0C, but frosts of -10\u00b0C are common too. Precipitation is common, although more often in the form of rain rather than snow. Any amount of snowfall generally unfortunately derails public transport.\n\n\nIce skating\nWhenever it freezes longer than a day, many Dutch people will take their skates out of the closet. The few Dutch who still don't have skates are likely to buy a pair. Soon the whole country's full of skating areas just created on frozen little canals or, after more severe frosts, on larger water surfaces. It's also common to organise little fields for skating by spraying water over them. Severe winters offer many ice tours, with the famous Frisian Elfstedentocht (eleven town tour or eleven cities tour) being by far the most popular event. Unfortunately there has to be severe frost for many days to make this national celebration possible, and the last time this occurred was in 1997.\nDue to this tradition of skating, the Netherlands usually dominates the speed skating events at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nTourist information\n\nTourist offices in the Netherlands can be recognised by a blue logo with three characters VVV. This abbreviation means: Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer. In the main cities and tourist places you will find VVV offices, sometimes run by volunteers. Staff usually speaks English and especially in areas frequently visited by international travellers, printed information in English is available too. The main goal is to inform and advise visitors about the main tourist attractions in the community and region, assist with hotel reservations and to inform about museums, opening hours, etc. Often you can buy tickets for events or gift certificates. Informative leaflets and simple maps are available for free.  More advanced maps, books and souvenirs can be bought.\n\n Holland.com tourist information website. (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Dutch phrasebook\nThe national language in the Netherlands is Dutch (Nederlands). It's a charming, lilting language punctuated by phlegm-trembling glottal gs (not in the south) and schs (also found, for example, in Arabic). Dutch, especially in written form, is partially intelligible to someone who knows other Germanic languages (especially German and Afrikaans), and you might be able to get by at least partially in these languages if spoken slowly.\nHowever, the Dutch merchant tradition and international attitude have left this little country with a strong tradition of multilingualism. The majority of the adult population is able to speak English relatively well, and most younger people speak it fluently, so you should have no trouble getting by. If you attempt to speak Dutch to locals and it does not sound native, do not be surprised if they respond to you in English. Do not take this personally; they are not trying to be rude, but just trying to make communication easier. If you want to practise your Dutch, just tell them and they will usually oblige if they are not in a hurry.\nWhile less widely spoken than English, basic German is also spoken by many, especially by seniors and those in the regions near the German border. It is a mandatory subject in high school for two years, though German fluency among younger people is marginal at best. French and Spanish are spoken by some as well, but proficiency is rare and usually on a much lower level than English or German. French and especially Spanish are slowly gaining on German in popularity.\nBesides Dutch, several regional languages and dialects are spoken. In the eastern provinces of Groningen, Overijssel, Drenthe and Gelderland people speak a local variety of Low Saxon (including Grunnegs and Tweants). In the southern province of Limburg the majority speaks Limburgish, a regional language unique in Europe because of its use of pitch and tone length to distinguish words. Frisian is the only official language besides Dutch, but only common in the province of Friesland. It's the closest living continental language to English.\nForeign television programmes and films are almost always shown in their original language with subtitles. Only children's programmes are dubbed into Dutch.\n\n\nGet in\nThe Netherlands is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\nAll non-EEA/Swiss travellers must register their residence within 5 business days of entering the Netherlands with the Aliens' Police (Vreemdelingenpolitie) or the municipality responsible for your place of residence. Hotels normally will handle the registration formalities for their guests.\nApplications for visas and long-term residence permits are handled by the IND. Travellers from Australia, Canada, Japan, Monaco, New Zealand, Vatican City, the UK, the US, South Korea, and Switzerland can enter the Netherlands without a provisional residence permit (MVV) to stay for more than 90 days for any purpose, but must complete registration formalities with the IND and obtain a residence within 90 days of entering, while all other foreign nationals will likely need a provisional residence permit visa to stay for longer than 90 days.\nDutch territories in the Caribbean are not part of the Schengen Area and have slightly different visa requirements from the European Netherlands, but in short, if you do not need a visa to visit the Netherlands, you can also visit these territories without a visa. You may visit the Dutch Caribbean with a valid Schengen visa, but Dutch Caribbean visas are not valid for visits to the European Netherlands.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nSchiphol Airport (AMS IATA), near Amsterdam, is a European hub and, after London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt Airport, the largest in Europe. It's a point of interest in itself, being 4 metres below mean sea level. It is the main hub of national carrier KLM, which is the oldest airline in the world that has been continuously operating under the same name, and is well-served by flights from major cities throughout the world.\nSome budget airlines also fly to the Netherlands. Jet2.com, Easyjet, Transavia and other low-cost carriers serve Schiphol, providing a fairly economical way to city-hop to Amsterdam from other spots in Europe. Especially flying to/from the British Isles and the Mediterranean countries can be relatively cheap. It's important that you book as early as possible, as prices tend to get higher closer to departure.\nFrom Schiphol there are excellent railway connections: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and many other cities have a direct train service. International high speed trains depart to Antwerp, Brussels and Paris. The train station at Schiphol is underground, under the main airport hall. The train is the quickest and cheapest way to get around in the Netherlands.\nTaxis are expensive: legal taxis have blue number plates, others should be avoided. Illegal taxi services are frequently offered outside the airport, but these will charge large sums of money for even short trips. Some hotels in Amsterdam and around the airport have a shuttle bus service.\nOther international airports are Eindhoven Airport, Maastricht/Aachen Airport, Rotterdam - The Hague Airport, and Groningen-Eelde Airport. These smaller airports are mainly served by low-cost airlines. Eindhoven Airport and Maastricht/Aachen Airport are mostly used by Ryanair, while Rotterdam Airport is frequented by Transavia, the low-cost subsidiary of KLM for tourists. The operator CityJet does an expensive commuter trip to London City Airport from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. A direct bus connection, either to the local railway stations and then taking the train are the best way to get to Amsterdam or any other town. There is a direct bus service between Eindhoven Airport and Amsterdam Central Station.\nIt is also possible to come to the Netherlands via airports in surrounding countries. Often-used airports are D\u00fcsseldorf Airport and Brussels Airport. European low cost carriers such as Ryanair also use the airports of M\u00fcnster-Osnabr\u00fcck (FMO IATA) and Weeze/Niederrhein (NRN IATA) which are near or just at the Dutch/German border. From these two airports there are frequent flights to major European destinations.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in the Netherlands\n\nThe cheapest train tickets are often sold out early and reservations are generally possible three to six months in advance depending on the company, type of ticket and booking channel. Bookings can be made via NS International (Dutch railways) or its German and Belgian counterparts. NS International also sells combined tickets for their trains and Eurostar to get you to the Netherlands from London.\n\n\nFrom France, Belgium and Great Britain\nEurostar operates high-speed trains to the Netherlands from Belgium, France and England. The cheapest tickets are to be found by booking a return in advance or if you're under 26 or over 60. Direct trains connect Brussels, London, Paris, Antwerp and Lille to Amsterdam (Centraal and Schiphol Airport) and Rotterdam (Centraal). Maastricht can also be indirectly reached by Eurostar, changing at Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins or Aachen Hauptbahnhof for a local train.\nWhen travelling to or from London, passengers undergo passport and security controls before boarding the train; allow up to 90 min in London or 60 min in Amsterdam/Rotterdam. All other Eurostar services operate within the Schengen Area, so there are no border controls.\nIntercity Brussels runs between Amsterdam and Brussels. This is a non-high-speed service, with lower priced tickets than Eurostar, and additionals discounts are available during the weekend.\nThere are local trains from Antwerp to Roosendaal and from Li\u00e8ge to Maastricht. A light rail service from Maastricht to Hasselt is being built and will start operating in a few years.\n\n\nFrom Germany, Switzerland, Denmark...\nThe Inter-City Express (ICE) high-speed train, runs from Basel via Frankfurt to Amsterdam, via Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, Arnhem, and Utrecht.\nIntercity trains run from Berlin and Hanover via Osnabr\u00fcck to Amsterdam and Hengelo, Deventer, Apeldoorn, Amersfoort and Hilversum.\nSleeper trains used to be plentiful but were gradually withdrawn from service throughout the last decades and in 2016 the last sleeper train that served the Netherlands was withdrawn. However, in 2021 \u00d6BB Nightjet restarted services from Innsbruck, Munich, Z\u00fcrich, Basel and Vienna to Amsterdam. NS also sells tickets for these trips. Deutsche Bahn sells tickets for all regional trains in and through Germany and all ICEs, ICs and ECs as well as a handful of others.\nThere are also a number of regional trains from and to Germany:\n\nBetween Groningen and Leer trains run every hour.\nThere are  trains between Enschede and M\u00fcnster every hour, also between Enschede and Dortmund every hour.\nTrains run hourly between Venlo and Hamm, via M\u00f6nchengladbach and D\u00fcsseldorf.\nTrains run every hour between Heerlen and Aachen and further to Eschweiler/Stolberg (Rheinland).\n24 trains per day link Hengelo and Bad Bentheim between 06:09 and 22:09.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n\nLocal\nFor a list of border-crossing buses between Germany and the Netherlands, look  here.\nFor a list of border-crossing buses between Belgium and the Netherlands, look here.\nApart from being a peculiar result of ancient European history, the town of Baarle (formally Baarle-Hertog in Belgium and Baarle-Nassau in the Netherlands) is a possible change point, since the town's main bus stop Sint-Janstraat is operated by Flemish (Belgian) and Dutch buses.\nThe Flemish (Belgian) company De Lijn operates a border-crossing bus between Turnhout in Belgium and Tilburg in the Netherlands, both of which are termini in the respective country's railway network.\n\n\nIntercity\nUntil the 2010s, Germany and France had no intercity buses to speak of and consequently few if any connections to the Netherlands were available. However German and French laws have since been changed and there are now several lines and operators connecting points in the Netherlands with Germany, France, Belgium or Luxembourg.\nFlixbus serves international routes throughout the Netherlands and the neighbouring countries, as well as domestic services.\nStudent Agency is a Czech company serving some points in the Netherlands\nThere are bus companies serving the Bosnian diaspora, which provide a cheap and clean way of getting to the other side of the European continent. Semi tours runs several times per week from various destinations in Bosnia and Hercegovina to Belgium and the Netherlands, off-season about \u20ac135 for a return ticket.\n\n\nBy car\nThe Netherlands has good roads to Belgium and Germany, and ferry links to Great Britain. The country has a dense, very well-maintained and modern highway/motorway network. However the quantity of traffic makes most main roads liable to serious congestion. Borders are open under the terms of the Schengen Agreement. While cars may be stopped at the border for random checks, this rarely happens. There are car ferry services from the United Kingdom (see below).\n\n\nCar shuttle train (Channel Tunnel)\nFrom the United Kingdom, the Netherlands can be reached via the Channel Tunnel shuttle train between Folkestone and Calais, from where you drive through France and Belgium. From the Calais terminal, most of the Netherlands can be reached via autoroute A16 towards Dunkirk (Dunkerque). Once in Belgium, continue in the direction of Bruges (Brugge), Ghent (Gent) and Antwerp (Antwerpen). Near Antwerp, Rotterdam is signposted (via the Liefkenshoek toll tunnel) as is Breda (for Utrecht and the east) and Eindhoven (for the south east). As the UK is not part of the EU or Schengen zone, full border checks apply before boarding the shuttle in Folkestone, though you can drive straight onto the road network upon arrival in France. See eurotunnel.com for more information.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nThere are three ferry services from the UK:\n\nStena Line between Harwich and Hook of Holland. Dutchflyer Rail & Sail is a combination ticket that includes the train ride from anywhere on the Greater Anglia network (including London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, and Norwich) to Harwich and the ferry.\nDFDS Seaways between North Shields near Newcastle upon Tyne and IJmuiden on the outskirts of Amsterdam.\nP&O Ferries between Kingston upon Hull and Rotterdam Europoort.\nYou may find it more convenient to take the ferry from Dover to Calais or Dunkirk, which are only just over 100 km by road from the southwestern province of Zeeland. As the UK is not part of the EU or Schengen zone, full border checks apply.\nRotterdam is also the second largest port in the world, and (in theory) a good place for freighter travel.\n\n\nCycling or walking\nThanks to a very flat topography and good infrastructure, you can comfortably cycle or walk to the Netherlands from Belgium, the north of France, Germany, or even from England.\nThe Netherlands is on EuroVelo EV12, known as the North Sea Cycle Route, which follows the whole North Sea coastline, with ferry crossings, from Norway to Scotland. For cyclists from Britain, this links up with the Dover-Calais/Dunkirk ferries.\nThe LF long-distance cycle network is shared with Belgium. The LF 1/Noordzeeroute even continues to Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.\nFrom the east the German R 1 connects Berlin eventually to the LF 4/Midden-Nederlandroute which ends in The Hague.\nFor walkers the Dutch LAW-paden network is connected with the Belgian Grote Route paden.\nNearly all cycle and walking route are served by hotels, camp sites and budget accommodation\n\n\nGet around\nThe Netherlands is served by an extensive public transport network, making this a good way to get around and discover the main sights. Motorists can rely on an extensive system of (Auto)snelwegen (Highways/motorways) and Autowegen (semi-highways). Of course the Netherlands is known as one of the most bicycle-friendly countries in the world. A truly extensive bicycle infrastructure makes cycling an excellent way to get around.\n\n\nPublic transport\nThe Netherlands has a fine-grained and well-organised public transport system. Most villages can be reached by public transport although services may be infrequent, especially at weekends. The Dutch public transport system consists of a train network which serves as the backbone, extended with a network of both local and inter-local buses. Amsterdam and Rotterdam have a metro network, each of only a few lines, although Rotterdam's line E reaches The Hague. Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague also have extensive networks of trams. Utrecht only has two tram lines which serve mainly as links to the surrounding suburbs of Nieuwegein and IJsselstein.\n\n\nTravel information\n 9292.nl, \u260f 0900-9292 (high cost). A journey planner for all Dutch public transport - All public transport companies participate in the OV Reisplanner, which can plan a door-to-door (or tourist hotspot-to-hotspot) trip for you using all public transportation types. The site mostly relies on scheduled detours, but delays are incorporated to a limited degree. 9292 -information is also available by telephone costs about \u20ac0.70 min, maximum: \u20ac14. \nNederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways)- Information about trains can be found at the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) website, which includes a trip planner which uses the latest information about train delays and detours.\nAt a railway station - At large railway stations there are (yellow) information desks; at most smaller stations there is an information/SOS telephone pole. If you push the blue information button you are connected to an operator for travel information. If you ask railway staff, they'll often look for you in their smart-phone journey-planner.\nMany trains have digital displays with current travel information. Most train platforms and some bus stops have electronic information. If you log into the train wifi, you'll see the route information, too.\n\n\nTickets\n\n\nOVpay\nThe easiest way to travel around is by using your bank card directly on the readers / gates. The working is similar to the older OV-chipkaart system, you check in when you start traveling (single beep), and check out when you stop traveling (double beep). You should use the same card when checking out. When you switch train operators, trams or buses; you also have to check out and check in again. There is no need to check out and back in when transferring from metro to metro or train to train from the same carrier/operator.\nYou can only use OVpay for second class train travel and distance-based fares. Not all operators support discount subscriptions with OVpay yet.\n9292\nIn addition to being a journey planner the 9292 smartphone app can be used to buy ticketsfor the whole of the planned journey.\n\n\nOV-chipkaart (being phased out)\nMain article: OV-chipkaart\nAll public transport in the Netherlands (buses, trams, metros and trains) accept contactless smart cards called OV-chipkaart (OV stands for Openbaar Vervoer meaning \"Public Transport\"), sometimes also called the Public transport chipcard.\nThe OV-chipkaart comes in three versions:\n\nDisposable OV-chipkaart is a single-use ticket. It can not be reloaded. Some public transport companies in cities offer 1-, 2- or 3-day tickets offering unlimited use in certain regions.\nAnonymous OV-chipkaart is a card to load credit. The purchase price for an empty card is \u20ac7.50 (as of 2014) and is non-refundable. These cards are available at ticket offices and vending machines valid up to 5 years. This card is reusable and reloadable. Since the introduction of OVpay there is limited reason to buy this card, as you can use your bank card to travel.\nPersonal OV-chipkaart is useful for anyone entitled to travel with a discount or monthly or annual season ticket. The online form requires an address in the Benelux or Germany and payment by iDeal or PayPal, you may contact them if you live outside these countries as long as you have a valid IBAN bank account number. This card features the holder's photograph and date of birth.\nAnonymous and personal cards must have a minimum stored value when travelling on the balance, which for NS trains is \u20ac20 (unofficially \u20ac16) and generally \u20ac4 for local public transit operators.\nThe upfront cost (\u20ac7.50) of the anonymous OV-chipkaart is non refundable.\n\n\nUnlimited Travel Ticket\nHolland Travel Ticket allows unlimited travel through all off the Netherlands by train, tram, bus and metro for 1 day for \u20ac48 (May 2023).\nEurail (non-european residents) has passes for unlimited train travel throughout the benelux for 3 to 8 days. With the price for an adult ranging from \u20ac35,- to \u20ac50,- per day. \u20ac30,- to \u20ac43,- for the ages 12-27 and 60+. and kids age 0-11 travel for free. The more days you take the cheaper. (June 2024).\nInterrail (European residents) also have a Benelux passes.\n\n\nTrain ticket deals\nWith an NS Off-Peak Group Ticket, you pay a fixed amount for a one-way ticket on a route that you select yourself. The bigger the group, the lower the price per person. \u20ac34 for 2 people (\u20ac17 per person) to \u20ac50 for 7 people (\u20ac7,15 per person). For reference a trip from Amsterdam to Maastricht is \u20ac29,40 per person.\nThe Spoordeel Winkel of the NS they have deals include the travel from your local train station to popular attractions like the efteling. and other museums, zoo's, amusement parks and cities. These deals also include the entry to the attraction unless its a city, then it includes a food and drink from the Kiosk at the train station.\nBoth of these deals are Only valid during off-peak hours. Meaning you can not travel between 06:30-09:00 and 16:00-18:30. Valid all day on weekends, public holidays. Except on Koningsdag (April 27).\n\n\nBy train\n\nSee also: Rail travel in the Netherlands\nMost of the Netherlands is densely populated and urbanised, and train services are frequent to most big cities and larger villages and towns in between. There are two main types of trains: Intercities which only stop at major stations and Sprinters which stop at all stations. All types of train have the same prices. Also, there are high-speed trains called 'Intercity Direct' between Amsterdam and Breda, which only requires a supplement ticket between Schiphol and Rotterdam. Travelling all the way from the north of the country (Groningen) to the south (Maastricht) takes approximately 4 hours.\nThe Spoorkaart is a map of the railway system and shows all services. You can obtain the most recent version from this page on NS' website (listed under Informatie towards the bottom). Connections with only one train per hour are shown in thinner lines. A live Spoorkaart shows where trains are at the moment, with updates as they move.\nMost lines offer one train every 15 minutes (every 10 min during the rush hours), but some rural lines run only every 60 min. Where more lines run together, the frequency is, of course, even higher. In the western Netherlands, the rail network is more like a large urban network, with up to 12 trains per hour on main routes.\nThe (NS) operates most routes. Some local lines are operated by Keolis, Arriva, Veolia and Connexxion.\nBecause of the high service frequency, delays are quite common. However, the delay is usually not more than 5 or 10 minutes. Trains can be crowded, especially in the morning rush hour. Reserving seats on domestic trains is not possible.\nOne particular mistake tourists often make is getting on the wrong part of a train. Many trains consist of two parts with different destinations. Somewhere on the way to the final destination, the parts will be separated and will continue on their own to their respective destinations. In that case, the signs over the platforms will show two destinations and which part goes where: achterste deel/achter means back and voorste deel/voor means front, referring to the direction of departure. Feel free to ask other passengers or an employee.\nAnother frequently made mistake involves travelling from Schiphol to Amsterdam. From Schiphol you can go to either Amsterdam Centraal or Amsterdam Zuid (South). These railway stations are not connected directly and many tourists with the idea of going to Amsterdam Centraal wind up at South. Therefore, always check the destination of the train. From Amsterdam Zuid you can take the metro to Centraal, or a train to Centraal with an interchange at station Duivendrecht (2nd floor).\nThere is a convenient night train service (for party-goers and airport traffic) between Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague, Leiden, Schiphol, Amsterdam, and Utrecht, all night long, once an hour in each direction. On Friday and Saturday evenings, some train lines run an additional late train to other cities.\nMost trains have two comfort classes (1e klasse and 2e klasse). Most regional lines not run by NS don't have first class. First class and second class are usually distinguished by different colour schemes. Signs with either \"1\" or \"2\" next to outside doors and carriage doors indicate class. Some zones in train are silent zones. Noise is to be kept to a minimum in these areas. They are indicated either by a stylised face in silhouette holding a finger to the lips, or a yellow oval with \"Ssst\". Usually, there's \"stilte / silence\" on the windows of a stiltecoup\u00e9.\nFree Wi-Fi is available at almost all major train stations and in most trains. Electrical outlets are always available in first class (except some regional trains) and in newer trains also in second class.\n\n\nAt the station\nMost stations are small with only one or two platforms. Stops at towns or villages in general aren't provided with railway staff. However cities like Amsterdam and Utrecht have large central stations with up to 14 platforms. It can take 5, maybe even 10 minutes to move from one platform to another, especially for people who not familiar with the station.\nThe platforms are all numbered. When platforms are so long that two or more trains can halt at the same platform, the different parts of the platform are indicated with the lowercase letters a/b/c. On some stations, capital letters are used to indicate which part of the train stops at which part of the station. Do not confuse the lower case and upper case letters.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nThe network of regional and local buses in the Netherlands is fine-grained and frequent and usually connects well with the train network; by bus travellers can reach most small villages easily. However, for long-distance travel, these regional buses are not convenient and much slower than the train.\nPreviously, long-distance buses were only available on a small number of routes that aren't covered by the rail network; these buses have special names that differ by region, such as Q-liner, Brabantliner and Interliner and special tariffs. However, German long-distance bus company Flixbus has been expanding its range of domestic connections in the Netherlands, with ticket prices starting around \u20ac10.\nThe main local and regional bus companies in the Netherlands are Connexxion, Arriva, EBS, Keolis and Qbuzz. Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague have their own public transport company. A lot of Connexxion buses, especially around Amsterdam, Haarlem and Schiphol, operate under R-NET livery.\nMany companies and regions have their own bus discount tickets, which are often cheaper than using credit on the OV-chipkaart.\nPark-and-ride-(travel-)tickets: some towns and cities have special cheaper bus tickets from car parks near the city limits to the city centre, for outside rush hours, usually a return ticket.\n\n\nNight buses\nAmsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht offer public transport at night. Only Amsterdam has a service all night and every night; in the other cities it is more limited to the beginning of the night or only during the weekend. Several other cities and regions also have night buses, usually even more limited. Some night buses cover quite a distance, such as Amsterdam-Almere.\nGetting around at night might prove to be a challenge, with even Schiphol being hard to reach from several cities and villages directly around it.\nYou might need special night-bus tickets so be sure to check the city pages.\n\n\nBy metro\nThe two largest cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, have a metro network which consist of mainly elevated railways outside the city centres, and some kilometres underground railways within the centre.They are served by  either RET and GVB. Line E of the Rotterdam metro has a start/final destination at The Hague Central Station.\n\n\nBy tram\nFurthermore, there is a large city tram network in the agglomerations of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague; Utrecht has a few sneltram lines (fast tram or light-rail).\n\n\nBy bicycle\n\nMain article: Cycling in the Netherlands\nCycling in the Netherlands is much safer and more convenient than in many other countries, because of the infrastructure - cycle paths, cycle lanes, and signposted cycle routes - and because of the small distances and flatness. All these factors plus many more additional facilities such as numerous picnic places, terraces, small ferry-connections and camping places, makes it often preferable to discover the country by bike rather than by car.\nThe proliferation of bicycles also means that you're seen as a significant part of the traffic mix - motorists will let you know if you don't keep to the rules and presume you are aware of other traffic. This is specially important to know in the very busy (chaotic) centres of the biggest cities. Here it can be sensible to get off your bike for a few hundred metres and/or leave the centre entirely by taking the bike onto a train, metro or randstadrail-tram).\nSome things to know:\n\nCycle lanes and cycle paths are indicated by a round blue sign with a white bike icon, an icon on the asphalt, or by red asphalt. Using them is considered mandatory.\nCyclists must obey the same traffic signs as motorists, unless exempted. For example, a cycle icon under a no-entry sign, usually with the text 'uitgezonderd' (except), means cyclists may use the street in both directions.\nWhere there is no cycle lane or path, use the regular road. This is unlike the rule in Germany and Belgium, where you are supposed to use the footpath in many places. Cyclists are not allowed on all (semi-)highways indicated as \"Autosnelweg\" or \"Autoweg\"\nOn some narrow streets that do have a cycle path parallel to them, mopeds may be required to use the cycle path, rather than the main street (as is usual).\nBicycles must have working front (white) and rear (red) lights. Reflectors are not sufficient. You may be fined (\u20ac40) for cycling in the dark without a light, and you seriously endanger yourself and other traffic by doing so. Small, battery-operated LED lights attached to your person are allowed.\nRegular signs for bicycle routes are usually white, with a red border and lettering, more recreational/tourist routes to a town or village are green lettered. In rural areas as well as in nature areas, signposts may be so called Paddenstoelen (mushrooms). These are small boxes (more or less resembling the form of a mushroom) near the ground on which the destinations are printed.\nThere are different ways to use a bicycle:\n\nstaying in a city, the bike can be used as a means of transport, to get from A to B. This is the way local people most of the time use it, for short journeys it is faster than car, bus or tram. Cyclers can also reach interesting places near the city, which may not be accessible by public transport.\nMany times bikes are also used as means to see nearby places and landscapes:\nThe many signposted cycle routes are designed for this, most of them take cyclists back to the starting point. Some rural routes go through areas inaccessible by car.\nIn most parts of the Netherlands it's possible to create your own routes by connecting marked and numbered points called \"knooppunten\". (see for more information planjeroute.nl (plan your route) .)\nExcept for the rush hours in the morning and at the end of the afternoon, bikes can be taken on a train. Therefore, cyclists are to buy a supplementary ticket called \"dagkaart fiets\", which is easily obtained from the automated kiosks for \u20ac6. As an alternative, bikes can be easily rented at (or near) train stations.  Folding bikes can be taken on board for free as hand luggage when folded. All trains are provided with specific bicycle entrances. Cyclists may park their bike here and also are allowed to ask people to move for this reason. Also in two western urban region's it's possible to transport bicycles for free by metro (Amsterdam/The Hague-Rotterdam) or randstadrail-tram (The Hague-Zoetermeer), except during daytime from Monday-Friday.\nMore experienced cyclists may like to set off across the country. The national long-distance cycle routes are designed for this type of holiday; see Cycling in the Netherlands Long-distance routes.\nThe best online routeplanner for cyclists can be found at a wikiplanner made by volunteers of the Dutch cyclist union \"Fietsersbond\".\n\n\nBike theft\n\nBike theft is a serious problem in the Netherlands, especially around train stations, and in larger cities. If possible, use the guarded bike parking ('stalling') at train stations and in some city centres. They will cost up to \u20ac1.20 per day. In general, use 2 locks of different kinds (for example, one chain lock and one tube lock). This is because most bike thieves specialise in a particular kind of lock, or carry equipment best suited to one kind of lock. Ideally, you should lock the bike to a lamppost or similar. Bike thieves have been known to simply load unattached bikes onto a pickup truck, so they can crack open the locks at leisure.\nIn cities, bikes are often stolen by drug addicts, and they sell most stolen bikes too. They often simply offer them for sale to passers-by, if they think no police are watching. Buying a stolen bike is itself illegal, and police do arrest buyers. If you buy for a suspiciously low price (e.g. \u20ac10-20), or in a suspicious place (in general, on the street), the law presumes you \"know or should have known\" the bike was stolen. In other words, actual ignorance of the bike's origins is no excuse.\nBike thefts should be reported to the police. Please do so.\n\n\nBuy or rent\nBike shops are the best place to buy a second-hand bike legally, but prices are high. Some places where you can rent bikes will also sell their written off stock, which is usually well maintained. Most legal (and often cheap) second-hand bike sales now go through online auction sites like marktplaats.nl - the Dutch subsidiary of eBay.\nAlmost all Dutch train stations have bikes from the bike rental system OV-fiets. You need a personal OV-chipkaart with a free OV-fiets season ticket or NS Flex season ticket. these season tickets require a bank account that supports iDeal payments. The fee of \u20ac4.55 per day is debited automatically, and a surcharge of \u20ac10 for one-way rentals applies. Smaller stations usually only have a few bikes available so sometimes they are all rented out. A limited number of train stations also have e-bikes available for a higher fee. In Gelderland and Friesland some train stations have bikes from Deelfiets Nederland, for those bikes the fee is \u20ac6.00 per day.\n\n\nExtra legal protection\n\"Weaker\" parties in traffic such as cyclists and pedestrians enjoy extra protection from the law regarding liability when an accident occurs with a \"stronger\" party (e.g. cars). The basic idea is that the stronger participant (e.g. a car driver) is always liable when an accident occurs between a weaker (e.g. a cyclist) and the stronger party, unless force majeure can be proven. Force majeure is here defined as (1) the car driver was driving correctly and (2) the faults of the cyclist were so unlikely that the car driver did not have to accommodate his driving for them. When this cannot be proven, the car driver is liable, but this can be limited when the accident can be attributed to the behaviour of the cyclist, up to 50% (more if the cyclist was consciously being reckless).\nThe burden of proof for force majeure, for faults of the cyclist and for recklessness are with the car driver. Such things can be hard to prove, which is why in practice some people will say cyclists and pedestrians always have right of way, but this is incorrect.\n\n\nBy car\n\nA car might be a good way to explore the countryside, especially places not connected by rail, such as the Veluwe and parts of Zeeland. Drive on the right.\nThe motorway (freeway) network is rather extensive, though heavily used. Congestion, especially during peak hour, is usual and can better be avoided. Roads are well signposted and many times provided with new technologies. A motorway (autosnelweg) is indicated with a letter A/number combination which is placed in a red box. In the less urbanised parts, such as the south-west and the north, motorways are few. Many times connections there are made by a semi highway called Autoweg, or another N road. All these routes are indicated with a letter N/number combination in a yellow box. Most times, motorists will be directed by signage to the nearest A or N road, so those who would prefer a more scenic drive avoiding main roads will need to follow signs to local villages.\nIf you break down, phone the ANWB auto-club via the toll-free number 0800\u20130888. Your membership of a foreign auto-club might entitle you to discount rates on their services. Leased (business) cars and rental cars are usually covered by the ANWB services included in the lease/rental price; but you may want to check any provided booklets.\nRoad signs with directions are plenty, but having a navigation system is useful, especially in cities where there are many one way streets, and getting from one part of the city to another is not always so straightforward. Be careful not to drive on bus lanes, often indicated with a blue bus sign and markings such as Lijnbus or Bus, nor on cycling paths, marked by the picture of a bicycle, or by a reddish colour of the asphalt. Also, do not use the rush-hour-lanes (Spitsstrook) when the matrix display above the designated lane indicates a red \"X\" - this means they cannot be used.\nFuel is easy to come by, but expensive. It might be better to fill your vehicle before entering the Netherlands, since the Belgian and German fuel prices can be up to \u20ac0.30 lower per litre. Unmanned petrol stations, such as TanGo or Firezone, save up to 10 cents, but are still expensive than their Belgian counterparts. They accept all common debit and credit cards. Along highways many petrol stations are open 24/7. All stations sell both petrol and diesel. Liquid Petroleum Gas is sold at quite a few petrol stations along the highways, but is never sold in built-up areas. The symbol for LPG gas is a green-coloured pump icon, set beside the general case black-coloured pump icon.\nIf you come to the Netherlands with your LPG-fuelled car, you will probably need an adaptor. If you buy that in your country, specifically ask for a Dutch adaptor. The plug sold as \"European\" (screw style), used in Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, won't fit Dutch pumps.\n\n\nDriving rules\n\nRoad rules, markings and signs are similar to other European countries but have some particularities:\n\nAt unmarked intersections, traffic coming from the right always has priority. Traffic includes bicycles, horses, horse-drawn carts (recreational use and fairly uncommon), electric wheelchairs, small mopeds and motorised bicycles.\nCycle paths are clearly marked and are widespread throughout the country.\nOn motorways, on and off-ramps (slip-roads) are usually long and allow for smooth merging. However, returning onto the motorway from an exit lane is illegal. Passing on the right and needless use (other than for passing) of the outside lanes is prohibited. (Passing on the right is permitted only in slow, congested traffic.)\nIn built up areas public transport buses have the priority when leaving a bus stop, so be careful as they may pull in front of you expecting that you will give way.\nIf you are involved in an accident, both drivers need to complete and counter-sign a statement for their respective insurance companies (damage form/\"schadeformulier\"). You are required to have this form on hand. The police need to be notified if you have damaged (public) property (especially along the highways), if you have caused any sort of injury, or if the other driver does not agree to sign the insurance statement. It is illegal to hit and run. If the other driver does this, call the police and stay at the scene. The emergency telephonenumber is 112 (toll-free, will even work from disconnected mobile phones); the telephone number for a non-emergency police presence is 0900\u20138844.\n\n\nSpeed limits\nGeneral speed limits in the Netherlands are 50 km/h in built-up areas, 80 km/h outside of built-up areas, 100 km/h on expressways (autoweg in Dutch), and up to 130 km/h on motorways (autosnelweg) during the night. In all of these cases, exceptions are common, with for example many 30 km/h zones in built-up areas. 30 km/h zones are the home of unmarked intersections (so all traffic from the right has right of way!). On roads outside of built-up areas speed is often limited to e.g. 60 km/h, and on the motorway often to 100 km/h in urban areas. Some sections of motorways have signs indicating a speed limit with a sign \"6-19h\" below, which means that the indicated speed limit is valid from 06:00 to 19:00, with a 130 km/h limit applicable at other times. From 2020 the maximum speed limit on highways is 100 km/h from 06:00 to 19:00.\nSpeed indicated on the dot matrix signs above the lanes always take precedence over anything else you see, both when the speed is in a red circle (the regular speed limit) or without (an incidental speed limit, indicating traffic or construction). A white circle with a diagonal bar in it indicates 'end of all speed limits from dot matrix signs' from which moment on you obey the ordinary signs.\nYour speed will be checked nationwide by the police and fines are heavy. Exceeding the maximum speed with more than 50 km/h will result in seizure of your driving licence. After that driving is considered a criminal act. Pay extra attention to Trajectcontrole signs: that means that in the road you're driving there is an automatic system that checks your average speed on a long section. Radar detectors are illegal devices to have in your car. They will be impounded and you will be fined \u20ac250. Keep in mind that the police use so-called radar detector detectors to track down radar detector users, so it is best to turn them off. Drinking and driving is not allowed and this is enforced strongly. Breathalyser tests occur frequently, both on an individual basis (i.e. you get pulled over and the police see it necessary for you to undergo a breathalyser test) as on a bigger scale (i.e. the police has set up a designated control checkpoint on a highway). An unbroken yellow line next to the pavement means no stopping, a broken yellow next to the pavement means no parking. Some crossings have \"shark teeth\" painted on the road, this means you have to give way to the other traffic.\nPolice also use unmarked traffic surveillance cars, especially on the highways. They have a video surveillance system and often they don't stop you right after doing a violation but they keep on following you. That means if you do more violations, you'll be fined for everything you did. The policemen in unmarked cars are obliged to identify themselves after pulling you over, which means you shouldn't have to ask. Policemen in marked cars have to show their ID only when you ask them for it, but they too are obliged to show it when asked.\n\n\nUrban driving\nUrban driving in the Netherlands is considered by many tourists and locals alike to be an exasperating, time-consuming and expensive experience. The traffic systems of most city centres are designed to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians, rather than motorised vehicles.\nCity roads are narrow, riddled with speed bumps, chicanes and a large variety of street furniture (with knee-high, asphalt-coloured anti-parking poles being probably the most dangerous threat to paintwork as they tend to either blend into the background or be beneath the driver's view).\nOther hazards are:\n\nPedestrians protruding on the road or crossing in dangerous and not-permitted areas.\nCyclists have more rights and are more assertive in asserting them than in most countries, which can be intimidating to unaccustomed drivers. Please, always give priority to cyclists when turning across a cycle lane. If you are involved in a collision with a cyclist, you will be automatically liable (though not automatically guilty).\nNarrow bridges.\nParking in city centres can be expensive. Particularly in Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam, street parking is sometimes limited to only a few hours and prices are \u20ac3\u20136 per hour. Generally, underground car parks cost \u20ac4\u20136 per hour and may be by far the best choice for practical and safety reasons. Consider using public transport to avoid traffic jams and the great difficulties involved in finding a parking spot.\nP+R park and ride facilities are available at the outskirts of bigger cities; you can park your car cheaply there, and continue your journey via public transport.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nUber and Bolt operate in the Netherlands . (updated May 2024)\n\n\nBy taxi\n\nThe Dutch taxi system has been re-structured to change its bad reputation and sometimes exorbitant rates. While legal maximum charges now apply and all taxis are obliged to have a tariff sheet visible in the window, taxis still remain an expensive way to get around, and with good public transport, taxis are a much less popular mode of transport than in most places in the world. If you're travelling on a budget, public transport is a much better bet. With cluttered traffic in and around cities during rush hour, it's often enough faster too.\nIf you do want to take a taxi, you'll usually have to call one or order one online, so you might want to look up a company upon arrival. It's uncommon to hail taxis on the streets. In larger cities, you'll typically find a taxi stand at major train stations and sometimes close to entertainment districts. Drivers may want to convince you that you are obliged to take the first in line, but this is never the case. You are always free to pick the taxi of your choice. It is illegal for drivers to refuse short rides, but it's not uncommon for drivers who have obtained a front position to do so. Keep in mind that these guys sometimes wait for a long time to get to this position. If it's all the same to you, you might want to let them refer you to someone else. If you don't want to switch, or if it's the only taxi around, it may help to say you'll file a complaint and write down the taxi's number.\nAll taxis must have registered blue license plates and a board computer which also serves as the meter. They must have their rates visible on a tariff card and the driver has to carry a taxi driver's license card. Taxi companies are free to establish their rates, as long as they do not exceed the legal maximum. The driver is allowed to offer you a fixed price, as long as it's within legal maximum rates.\nTaxi scams are common, though, and being charged more than double the maximum rate is not uncommon. If you have to pay a round price (e.g. \u20ac55.00), you're likely being scammed.\nThe maximum rates are the sum of the initial fee, the fee per kilometre and the fee per minute. They are set annually by the Dutch government. For a normal (4-person) cab they are \u20ac2.95, \u20ac2.17 and \u20ac0.36. This means you'll pay more if you get stuck in traffic. For small vans (5 to 8 passengers), the maximum amounts are \u20ac6.00, \u20ac2.73 and \u20ac0.41.\n\n\nBy thumb\n\nMaking your way on thumb is accepted and locals that take you typically expect no payment in return. It's less suited for short rides from small towns or minor streets, as the lack of traffic may cause a long wait. Hitch-hiking on the highways/motorways is not allowed but generally tolerated on the interchanges/access points, provided you do not create a dangerous traffic situation. Interchanges are indicated by a letter A/number combination printed in a red box on signposts.\nTry to stay before the traffic sign highway/motorway (a blue rectangle with two separated lanes disappearing in the distances printed in white) or the sign of the front of a car, indicating the entrance to a semi-highway. Also try to stay on a spot where cars have slow speed and where it is possible for drivers to stop. The same safety rule applies to highway petrol stations and rest places, and to traffic lights on non-highway/motorway roads.\nFor longer distances, the large number of highway crossings make it difficult to find a driver going to your exact destination. A simple (cardboard) plate with your destination written on it is a common way to increase chances of finding the right driver, and may also convince suited drivers that they will not be stopping in vain.\nThere are recommended unofficial spots (liftplaats) (lift-stops) mainly at the edges of a few major cities:\n\n\nAmsterdam\nPrins Bernhardplein, before NS Station Amsterdam Amstel (on east side of the river Amstel) (past the bus stop).  Leads to the ramp of the S112 of the A10, direction A1-E231/A2-E35. It is recommended for the directions Central-/East-Netherlands. For other directions/routes try also alternative spots.\nAlternative spots / other directions (recommended for the directions West-/South-Netherlands):\n\nAmstel (on the west side of the river Amstel) near traffic-lights/Utrechtsebrug and near beginning-/end-stop of Tram-line 25. Leads to the ramp of the S111 of the A10, directions A2-E35-E25.\nJunction S109 of the A10, close to NS Station RAI (RAI Congress Centre; specially when there are large events or congresses). Leads to the ramp of the S109 of the A10, directions A2-E35-E25/A4-E19.\nAt bus stop Amstelveenseweg / Ringweg Zuid just northeast from metro station Amstelveensweg. There is an on-ramp which leads to the A10 North, A4 (to the South) and A9 (both directions). What makes this location convenient is that cars can easily stop in the bus lane in order to pick you up.\n\n\nThe Hague\nUtrechtsebaan next to the northside of the Malieveld, at the beginning of the A12-E30 towards Utrecht. Also possibilities towards A4-E19 for Delft-Rotterdam and for Leiden-Amsterdam\nAlternative spots / other directions:\n\nEdge at the northwest-side of the Malieveld/crossing Zuid-Holland-laan, Boslaan (Utrechtse baan), Benoordenhoutseweg, towards Leidsestraatweg-N44-A44 for Leiden and Amsterdam.\n\n\nNijmegen\nGraafseweg (Venlo and Den Bosch), at the major city-centre roundabout (verkeersplein) Keizer Karelplein (hitch-hiking on the roundabout itself is not recommended),\nnear the Waalbrug/before the bridge in direction Arnhem,\nat the Annastraat, close to the Radboud University (RU)/University Medical Centre (UMC),\nat the Triavium, across shopping centre Dukenburg.\n\n\nGroningen\nJunction of Emmaviaduct and Emmasingel (200 m west of Groningen station). For directions West and South, towards Friesland, Drenthe, and Eastern, Western and Southern Netherlands.\nJunction of Europaweg and Damsterdiep. For direction East, towards the east of Groningen province and Germany.\n\n\nOther cities\nUtrecht close to petrol station and ramp of the Waterlinieweg near 'De Galgewaard' soccer-football-stadium, North/Northeast to A27/A28, South/East to A2/A12/A27.\nDue to reconstruction of the road, the liftershalte in Maastricht at the beginning of the A2 (near the soccer stadium De Geusselt) unfortunately has been removed in 2012.\n\n\nBy plane\nDue to the small size of the country and the abundance of road and rail connections, there are no domestic flights. There are tourist flights with a classic Douglas DC-3, though. It's the closest thing to a domestic flight, because some of the flights start at one airport (for example Schiphol)  and land at another (Rotterdam).\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDutch culture\n\nFor many foreigners, nothing captures the idea of the Netherlands more vividly than windmills, wooden shoes, tulips, and remarkably flat lands. Although some of these characteristics have evolved into stereotypes far off from the daily lives of Dutch people, there's still a lot of truth to them and plenty of authenticity to be found. The Dutch have preserved many elements from this part of their past, both for tourism and for historic reasons.\nKinderdijk boasts a network of 19 windmills, once used to drain the adjoining polder. The Zaanse Schans has windmills as well, and a nice museum with traditional crafts and old Dutch houses on display. Schiedam, world-famous for its jenever, has the tallest windmills in the world, and they're right in its lovely old town centre.\nThinking about the Dutch countryside, you might imagine wide, flat, grasslands with black and white cows. If you do, you're not that far off. A large swathe of the country, especially the western part of it, consist of polders; reclaimed land separated by ditches. These rural areas are dotted with picturesque villages, old farms, impressive summer estates, and of course, windmills; the Zaanstreek-Waterland is especially scenic. For a touch of folklore, see the traditional clothing and fishermen boats in Volendam or Marken. You can go to the Zuiderzeemuseum in the city of Enkhuizen, or Openluchtmuseum in Arnhem for a touch of traditional Dutch life in bygone times. They are not nearly as overcrowded as Zaanse Schans, are specifically made for tourists and offer more. Both are open air museums, so don't forget to check the weather before you go.\nThe Netherlands is a major international player in the flower industry. The tulip fields are seasonal, and are specific to the Bulb Region and some areas in North Holland. Tulip fields offer great scenery for a bicycle tour. They are a lovely Dutch alternative to the lavender fields you could find in France. The famous Keukenhof, the world's largest flower garden, only opens between March and May. It is a great way to see what the Dutch flower industry has to offer.\nThey make great destinations for a recreational bike trip or can serve as a laid-back base, from where you can explore cities in the area. The rolling hills of South Limburg have characteristic timber-framed houses and a lot of castles. The province of Gelderland combines its many castles (Palace 't Loo in Apeldoorn being the highlight, having been thoroughly restored) with the natural scenery of the Veluwe. Don't worry if you're headed elsewhere: you'll find a beautiful countryside in every Dutch province.\n\n\nHistoric cities\n\nWandering through the magnificent city of Amsterdam, with its lovely canals and hundreds of 17th-century monuments, is a delightful experience. For most people, a visit to the Netherlands would not be complete without a good day in its bustling capital. Nevertheless, it is only one of many towns in the country that offers a beautiful, historic centre.\nBefore Amsterdam's rise to fame in the late 16th century, the fortified city of Utrecht was the country's most important town. Much of Utrecht's mediaeval structures remain, with canals flanked by wharf-based structures, lots of buildings from the Early Middle Ages and some impressive ancient churches. Maastricht is often claimed as the most beautiful city of the country. It is known for its romantic lanes, ancient monuments, and for what the Dutch call its \"Burgundian\" atmosphere.\nLeiden, the birthplace of Rembrandt and home to the oldest university of the country, is yet another beautiful place with canals, narrow streets, and over 2,700 monuments. The Hague is often called the \"judicial capital of the world\", as it famously hosts the Peace Palace and many international organisations. It has a spacious layout, with large estates, and the ancient Binnenhof, where the Dutch government had its seat for centuries. Also consider the gorgeous old town centres of Haarlem, Delft, 's-Hertogenbosch, Alkmaar, Gouda and Amersfoort.\n\n\nMuseums\nThe Netherlands is full of museums: almost every city has at least one museum and there is always a museum nearby. The Netherlands has more museums than many bigger countries like Italy.\nIf you intend to visit multiple museums during your stay, it is well worth it to buy the Museumkaart, which costs \u20ac75 for adults and \u20ac39 for under-18s. It gives you free (or sometimes discounted) access to more than 500 museums for a year.\nThere are two ways to get a Museumkaart:\n\nBuy one directly from selected museums (you can check which museums sell the museum card on their website). You'll immediately get a temporary Museumkaart, but this can only be used on five museums (buying the card at a museum counts as a visit to that museum) over a period of 31 days. To get the full card, you have to register your temporary card on their website, after which they will post it to an address in the EU within 5 working days.\nOrder one from their website.  This will also take 5 working days to be delivered, and has the extra obstacle that payment can only be done using iDeal.\nNote that you must present your physical card (or your temporary card) at a museum \u2013 you cannot just quote your card number. Tourists who intent to visit more than 5 museums within a year and want the full card should plan ahead to make sure the card is delivered on time.\n\n\nArt Museums\nConsidering its small size, this country has brought forward an impressive number of world-famous painters. Arts and painting flourished in the 17th century, when the Dutch Republic was particularly prosperous, but renowned artists have lived in the country before and after that age as well.\nRembrandt, Johannes Vermeer, Vincent van Gogh, Frans Hals, Jan Steen, Jacob van Ruysdael, and Piet Mondriaan are just a few of the Dutch painters whose works now decorate the walls of the world's greatest museums. Fortunately, some of these world-class museums can be found in the Netherlands as well. The Museum Quarter in Amsterdam has the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum and the Stedelijk Museum right next to each other, all three with excellent collections. The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam also has a huge collection of drawings, including Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and foreign masters. Mauritshuis in The Hague has the world-famous 'Girl with Pearl Earring' in addition to many other 17th-century paintings.\nThe Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum is beautifully located in the Hoge Veluwe National Park, with the second largest Van Gogh collection in the world (after the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam). Less focused on Dutch art, but with a unique modern collection, is the Van Abbe Museum in Eindhoven. Other cities with notable art museums include Groningen with the Groninger Museum, and Haarlem with the Frans Hals Museum. The newly established Hermitage in Amsterdam has all the grandeur of its big sister in Saint Petersburg, with changing Russia-oriented exhibitions on display.\n\n\nBooking in Advance\nMany museums only allow tickets to be bought online in order to manage overcrowding. To avoid disappointment, you should plan ahead as much as possible, at least to determine whether or not a museum requires booking. In general, popular museums that are located in a house or other small building will tend to be booked out in advance. Here are some museums to look out for:\n\nThe Anne Frank House in Amsterdam can be fully booked up to 3 weeks in advance.  If you've missed out on a ticket, you should keep checking the website regularly: 20% of tickets are released closer to the date.\nThe Van Gogh Museum can be booked out several days in advance.\nThe Rijksmuseum can be booked out one or two days in advance.\nThe Rietveld Schr\u00f6der House admits only a few dozen people each day, so early bookings are essential to avoid disappointment.\nThe Eise Eisinga Planetarium may be booked out during the weekends.\n\n\nLiving with the water\n\nThe Dutch are famous for their struggle with the sea. As a great naval power, the Netherlands owed its 17th-century Golden Age to the water, and still depends heavily on it for modern day trade and fisheries, as the massive, modern port of Rotterdam demonstrates. However, with much of the country's land below sea level, the water also caused terrible floods and great losses over centuries.\nDutch attempts to protect their lands with dikes are well recorded from the 12th century, but started around 2,000 years ago. An enormous flood in 1287 created the large Zuiderzee, an inland sea that is now known as the IJsselmeer. From that period onwards, a long process of reclaiming lands lost to the sea began. Windmills and extensive networks of dikes were created to pump out the water, slowly creating the characteristic polders. One of these polders is the Beemster Polder, and when you visit you get a few fortifications of the Defence Line of Amsterdam included as a bonus.\nAfter another devastating flood in 1916, the country started the Zuiderzee Works, a massive undertaking to reclaim and tame the Zuiderzee once and for all. In the 1930s, the impressive Afsluitdijk was finished, which turned the inland sea into a fresh water lake called the IJsselmeer. The Zuiderzee Museum in lovely Enkhuizen is devoted to the cultural heritage and folklore of the region, as well as the maritime history of the Zuiderzee.\nAnother devastating flood struck the country in 1953, recording 1,836 deaths in the province of Zeeland and the southwestern part of South-Holland. In the following 50 years, the famous Delta Works were constructed to protect the southwest from flooding. It can be visited at various visitor centres, the most notable of which is the Neeltje Jans park near the Oosterscheldekering (Eastern Scheldt Storm Surge Barrier). See the Deltawerken website for more information.\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers have recognised the Zuiderzee Works and the Delta Works collectively as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.\n\n\nDo\nOne of the most popular local pastimes is cycling, which makes sense given how flat the country is. Nowadays, the Netherlands boasts 22,000 km of dedicated cycle paths, forming a dense web across the country. If you do decide to cycle, you'll notice just how easy it is: the numbered routes and multitude of signposts means it's almost impossible to get lost! There are also plenty of areas well-suited for scenic cycling, including the Green Heart, Hoge Veluwe National Park, South Limburg, and the Zaanstreek-Waterland. Winds can be strong (because of the flat lands), and winters can be cold and rainy.\nThere is no shortage of beaches along the 1,245 km of Dutch coastline. Popular activities include swimming and sunbathing, but these are mostly restricted to warm summer days. Expect Scheveningen to be extremely crowded when temperatures rise towards tropical levels. More mellow and family friendly beaches include Zandvoort, Bloemendaal, Bergen, Noordwijk, Katwijk and the West Frisian Islands. Texel also has some beautiful beaches, but be careful; some beaches are reserved for nature and it is strictly forbidden to enter those.\nWater sports is another activity mostly undertaken by the locals. Lakes can be found in every province, but the Frisian Lakes are outstanding, especially during the annual Sneekweek that starts the boating season. Boating can be done without licence as long as the boat is not longer than 15m and/or faster than 20 km/h. Other lake-rich areas include Wijdemeren, Kaag, and Aalsmeer. Most of these lakes are very calm, with parasailing and rafting impossible.\nSauna is not as popular a pastime in the Netherlands as it is in Finland, but Dutch sauna complexes are some of the most opulent, typically featuring 10-20 saunas of different temperature, humidity, aromas, decor and method of heating. See [1]. Most Dutch saunas are nude and mixed-gender.\n\n\nMusic\nThe Netherlands has long been known for its great musicians, and today is no different, with high-level performances in a wide variety of styles throughout the country. The Royal Concertgebouw, Amsterdam's major symphony orchestra, is considered by many connoisseurs to be one of the best if not the very best in the world. The Netherlands also has a thriving pop music scene, with the Vengaboys being a famous example of a Dutch band.\n\n\nFestivals\nEvery two years, the country goes football crazy as either the European Championship or the World Cup is held. Complete streets will be decorated with orange flags, the country's national colour. It's not uncommon for literally fifty percent of the population to be watching a game if it's a particularly important one. Often bigger cities will put up large TV screens for the general public, like on the Rembrandtplein in Amsterdam. Likewise, cafes and bars are another popular place to watch games.\nIn the Southern Netherlands (North Brabant, Limburg and to a smaller extent also in Twente, Overijssel and the south of Gelderland), the Catholic celebration of Carnival is held since mediaeval times. It occurs immediately before Lent; which is usually during February or March. Parades can be seen almost in any town on Sunday, sometimes also occurring on Monday. Parades can also be held in the evening, usually on Saturdays all the wagons are then lit up by numerous small lights. The other days of the week, many activities can be found ranging from street painting (stoepkrijten) to beer drinking contests. The cities of 's-Hertogenbosch, Breda and Maastricht are advisable for attending Carnival.\nKing's Day (Koningsdag, until 2012 this was Queen's day) is held every year at April 27 all over the country (except if this day is a Sunday, then it will be held at the Saturday before). Every village, town and city, organises free markets and authentic Dutch games. Nowadays King's day much more becomes a day of festivals and parties. It is advised to wear orange clothing, as most Dutch people walk around in their national colour. An advisable city to attend at this day is Amsterdam, because it's one of the largest events of the year there. In several larger cities (most notably The Hague and Utrecht), the festivities start in the evening of 26 April. The Hague even has most of its festivities on the night before.\n Pinkpop. A three-day pop festival every year with Pentecost (\"Pinksteren\") in Landgraaf, Limburg. \n Lowlands. Popfestival - every second-to-last weekend of August at Biddinghuizen, Flevoland. \n Summercarnaval. A big parade through the centre of Rotterdam. One of the biggest events in the Netherlands. \n Northsea Jazz Festival. Big summer jazz festival, held in the Ahoy stadion, Rotterdam. Around 1,800 jazz, blues, funk, soul, hip Hop, Latin and r&b acts play during this 3 day event. \n Vierdaagsefeesten. Summer festival in Nijmegen lasting seven days, during the Nijmeegse Vierdaagse, which always starts on the 3rd Tuesday in July. The celebrations though start already the weekend before and over 1 million people attend. During the festival, there is a section for all the top Dutch bands such as Moke and Racoon, De Affaire which is focussed on alternative and rock, The Matrixx which has all your electronic dance music needs, and of course the numerous terraces and bars. \nSensation - (Formerly known as 'Sensation White') One of the best-known parties in the world organised by ID&T. 40,000 people all dressed in white gather to hear some big and upcoming house music DJs. Tickets usually sell out very fast. Several international editions are being organised several times a year around the world with the main concert being held in Amsterdam ArenA every summer. (For the last time in the Netherlands in summer 2017, but the organisation is working on a new event). Sensation Black (with hardstyle music) was hosted annually in the same location but is now being held in Belgium instead.\n Dance Valley. One of the largest dance festivals, with over 40,000 visitors. Annually mid July in park Spaarnwoude, near Schiphol Airport. The focus is on celebrating summer, and has circus tents in which every tent is a different genre in dance music. (updated Jun 2017)\n Mystery Land. Over 50,000 visitors. Dance festival with a flower-power theme. In the last week of August near Schiphol Airport. Most dance genres are present, including even electro. Also has activities such as workshops and theatre, which are usually uncommon with dance festivals. (updated Jun 2017)\n Defqon.1. Dance festival focussing on the harder dance styles, such as hardstyle and hardcore. Residing in Flevoland, usually in mid June. \n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nNetherlands uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\n\nBanknotes of \u20ac100 and especially \u20ac200 and \u20ac500 are very rarely used, and some merchants will not accept them due to concerns over financial crime. Typically, establishments will have a sticker or A4-sized poster near the entrance or cash register indicating which banknotes aren't accepted. Almost all ATMs will only dispense denominations of up to \u20ac50.\nIn many stores, especially supermarkets, it's common for the cash machine to round your total up or down (afronding) to the nearest 5 cents. Do not be surprised, this is allowed by law (the store should legally have a sticker informing you about this, but few stores have it). Because of this you don't get 1 and 2 cent coins back as change; these coins remain legal tender but may not be accepted.\n\n\nDebit cards and credit cards\nOften stores will display a sign saying \"Pinnen, ja graag\", loosely meaning \"debit cards gladly accepted\" (the Dutch word pinnen means to pay by debit card).\nDebit cards on the Maestro and V-Pay scheme are accepted everywhere. As one of the last countries in Europe, the Netherlands is moving to debit VISA/Mastercard. As of May 2023, almost all points of sale have been updated to accept VISA and Mastercard debit cards, but not necessarily Mastercard or VISA credit cards as that requires a special agreement with the merchant's bank (some international Mastercard or VISA debit cards, especially those issued outside the EEA, may be read as credit cards and refused by Dutch point-of-sales so be ready with alternative payment methods in case that happens).\nAcceptance of VISA and MasterCard credit cards and to a lesser extent American Express has grown, and is now fairly widespread to the point that some establishments no longer accept cash. In 2023, 4% of the stores in the Netherlands are pin-only. \nIn tourist destinations, you will generally find credit cards widely accepted. Debit cards and credit cards are also the only way to pay for bus or tram tickets on board (see #Get around). \nFor safety reasons, credit card use in the Netherlands often requires a PIN-code.\nContactless payments are the standard, with 93% of all card payments in June 2024 being contactless. As of 1 January 2020, all payment terminals in the Netherlands should offer contactless payments.  This also means Apple Pay and Google Pay transactions that are linked to a card scheme that is accepted by the merchant should be seamless.  \nATMs are readily available, mostly near shopping and nightlife areas. Even villages usually have one or more ATMs near the local supermarket. Geldmaat manages the ATMs for the largest banks in the Netherlands. See the map for ATM locations. The Geldmaat ATMs offer a bank note selection option; example: you want \u20ac50 with the selection option, you get 3 options, which can be 1x\u20ac50, 2x\u20ac20 + 1x\u20ac10 and 1x\u20ac20 + 3x\u20ac10.\n\n\nTaxes\n\n\nValue added tax\nAll goods and services include VAT (BTW: belasting over de toegevoegde waarde). By law, VAT is  always included in an item\u2019s price tag and this should not be an issue for travellers except when intending to claim a VAT refund. VAT is 21%, with a reduced rate of 9% for groceries, medicine, books, magazines and newspapers. Also public transport, bike, shoe and clothing repair services, hairdressers, accommodation (camp grounds, hotels etc), access to cultural and recreational attractions (i.e. amusement parks, museums, cinemas, festivals and theatres) and access to sport facilities (including swimming pools and sport games) have a 9% VAT rating.  \n\n\nTourist tax\nMunicipalities may choose to levy a tourist tax for each night a visitor stays in the municipality. It is usually included in the price of your accommodation. The owner of the accommodation will pay it to the municipality. Municipalities are free to set the tax rate, this might be a fixed amount or a percentage of the cost of accommodation, or a combination of both. In some municipalities the rate depends on the type of accommodation (a campground is usually cheaper than a hotel), the season or the age of the guest. The tax is used as a financial contribution towards municipal services such as maintenance of roads and parks and waste collection because tourists also benefit from them.\n\n\nTipping\nDutch law requires that all service charges and taxes are included in the prices that hotels, bars and restaurants publish. Tipping is therefore not necessary, but it is always appreciated as a reward for good service and it's increasingly common. Especially in tourist areas and large hotels, increased tipping is not uncommon. Many Dutch customers will leave \u20ac1 or \u20ac2, also in bars and simple diners, unless service was poor. For good service in a restaurant, feel free to leave what you feel is appropriate. A 5-10% tip on a restaurant bill is considered a generous reward for good service.\n\n\nBottle and can deposits\nThe Netherlands has a beverage container deposit (statiegeld) system to help recycling and prevent litter on the streets and in the environment.\nAll bottles and cans that have a deposit are labeled with the \u2018Statiegeld\u2019 logo.  See the website for the logo. \nPrices displayed in stores usually do not include the deposit. Receipts must show the deposit separately.\nSince the deposit on metal cans was introduced April 2023, retailers may still be selling older cans which don't have the logo.\nEmpty beverage containers can be returned for refund at larger supermarkets and manned gas stations. These locations are by law required to pay back the statiegeld.  Most stores do have one or more reverse vending machines (RVM), but may choose to take in the containers by hand.\nOther locations are not required to accept empty containers and if they do they may choose to donate the money to a good cause.\n\n\nOpening hours\nMost shops open by 09:00 or 10.00 and they usually close around 18:00. Supermarkets and DIY-shops often have broader opening hours, opening around 08:30 and closing only at 20:00 or 22:00. Traditionally, most shops are closed on Sundays, or only open on a few Sundays a year (known as \"koopzondagen\"). Legislative changes have allowed municipalities to make their own decisions on the number of koopzondagen, or Sundays on which shops are allowed to open. As a result, most of the shops in the centres of large cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Maastricht, etc.) are now open every Sunday, typically from 12:00 until 17:00 or 18:00. An increasing number of smaller cities, and especially the ones where tourism is a major economic factor, is following this trend. Unfortunately, the situation differs per location. Most smaller cities allow at least a supermarket to be open every Sunday, most have multiple Sunday openings per year, and some open every Sunday. Some smaller shops are closed on Monday mornings, or even close for an extra day in the week.\n\n\nShopping\nThe Netherlands is a good place to buy flowers. Flower bulbs are most suited to bring home, and can be purchased at tourist shops, garden centres and DIY stores throughout the year. Keep in mind that bulbs and their planting times depend on seasons, and tulip bulbs are typically unavailable from late winter to late summer. Fresh flowers can be bought from florists, or pre-packaged in most supermarkets. Although it is not a problem taking bulbs and flowers out of the country, you may be severely restricted in bringing them back to your own country.\nThe country is also famous for its wooden shoes (clogs). Nowadays almost no one, except for some farmers in the countryside and some fishermen in Volendam and Urk, wear them. Wearing wooden shoes in public outside the countryside will earn you quite a few strange looks from the locals. If you do try them on, the famous \"wooden shoes\" are surprisingly comfortable, and very useful in any rural setting. Think of them as all-terrain footwear; easy to put on for a walk in the garden, field or on a dirt road. If you live in a rural area at home, consider taking a pair of these with you if you can. Avoid the kitschy tourist shops at Schiphol and Amsterdam's Damrak, and instead look for a regular vendor which can usually be found in towns and villages in rural areas. The northern province of Friesland has a lot of stores selling wooden shoes, often adorned with the bright colours of the Frisian flag.\n\n\nCosts\nThe Netherlands is generally regarded as expensive (unless you're coming from Scandinavia or Switzerland). Public transport, lodging and dining are more expensive than in neighbouring countries, but museums and attractions tend to be affordable, and even cheap if you stay for longer and buy a Museumkaart (see Museums). Retail prices for clothing, gifts, etc. are similar to most of Western Europe; consumer electronics are a bit more expensive. Gasoline, tobacco and alcohol are relatively expensive due to excise taxes. The standard cigarette packages only have 19 cigarettes in them.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDutch cuisine\n\nThe Netherlands is not known for its cuisine, as it is simple and straightforward. A conventional Dutch meal consists of meat, potatoes and some type of vegetable on the side. The country's food culture is best described as rustic. High in carbohydrates and fat, the country's food culture reflects the dietary need of farm laborers, but as society moved on to work in the services sector, its food culture has remained largely the same. The Dutch national dish is stamppot, potatoes mashed with one or several vegetables. The variety with endive and bacon is considered the most traditional. Hutspot is a variety with carrots and onions.\nDutch cuisine differs strongly by region. Western cuisine is known for its many dairy products, including prominent cheeses such as Gouda, Edam, Leerdammer and Beemster. Being a coastal region, it has a seafood culture best represented by soused herring (haring), usually served with chopped onion and occasionally plopped into a bun (broodje haring). Northeastern cuisine is oriented towards meat due to the relative lack of agriculture in this region. Metworst, a dried sausage, is particularly prized for its strong taste, and Gelderse rookworst, a traditional smoked sausage, became an institution for the country as a whole and is often served together with stamppot. In the province of Zeeland, you can find the best mussels.\nSouthern cuisine is historically influenced by the Dukes of Burgundy, who ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages and were renowned for their splendour and great feasts. As such, it is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes. It is the only Dutch region which developed an haute cuisine that forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants. Typical main courses are biefstuk, varkenshaas, and ossenhaas, premium cuts of pork or beef.\nDutch people are generally not proud of their cuisine, but highly praise their sweet treats. Dutch pancakes (pannenkoeken), which are either sweet (zoet) or savoury (hartig) come in a variety of tastes, like apple, syrup, cheese, and bacon. Poffertjes are small, slightly leavened pancakes with butter and powdered sugar. Both are served in restaurants specifically dedicated to them. Syrup waffles (stroopwafels), two thin layers with syrup in between, are made fresh in most street markets and specialist stalls.\nSandwiches are consumed for breakfast and lunch. Those made in bakeries with aged Gouda cheese with or without butter are delicious. Chocolate sprinkles (hagelslag) on top of buttered slices of bread are a popular Dutch start of the day. Although food habits are changing, a simple bread roll with butter and a slice of cheese or ham is still the daily lunch for the majority of Dutch people. Dutch peanut butter is considerably different from the U.S. variety. As it's less common to have hot dishes for lunch, many restaurants offer a limited menu around lunch time. In smaller towns outside the main tourist spots you may even find restaurants to be closed for lunch altogether.\nSome food traditions are seasonal. Pea soup (erwtensoep) is a winter dish made of green peas and a smoked sausage. It is very hearty and often eaten after ice skating. Oliebollen are traditional Dutch dumplings consumed at New Year's Eve. Asperges flamandes are white asparagus with Hollandaise sauce, ham, crumbled hard-boiled eggs and served with boiled new potatoes. They are highly seasonal and usually only eaten between spring and summer.\n\n\nRestaurants\n\nRestaurants in the Netherlands serve good quality food and are relatively expensive compared with surrounding countries. Profit is often made from the drinks and the dessert, so be careful ordering those if you are on a budget. Service fees and taxes are included in menu prices. Tipping is not mandatory and seen as a sign of appreciation, not as means to make up a tiny salary. In case you do want to tip, rounding up to the next euro is already acceptable for small bills and a 5% to 10% tip is common for larger ones. A 10% tip will typically be considered generous, especially on a dining bill. Going to a restaurant is generally seen as a special night out with friends or family, not as a quick way to eat food. As such, dining with Dutch people can take a couple of hours.\nSmoking is banned in all restaurants, cafes, bars, festival tents and nightclubs. Smoking is allowed only outside or in separate, enclosed, designated smoking areas in which employees are not allowed to serve. Staff may enter such smoking rooms only in emergency situations.\nDutch food is not widely acclaimed, so most restaurants specialise in foreign cuisines, and the large cities offer a wide variety. Middle Eastern cuisine is readily available, even in smaller cities, and often comes at a bargain price. Popular dishes are shawarma (shoarma), lahmacun (often called \"Turkish pizza\") and falafel.  Due to Dutch colonial ties with Indonesia (then known as the Dutch East Indies), most small to medium-sized towns also have a Chinees-Indisch restaurant, serving Chinese and Indonesian dishes. Usually you get a lot of food for a small amount of money. Do not expect authentic Chinese or Indonesian cuisine though, as the food has been adapted for Dutch tastes. Typical dishes are fried rice (nasi goreng), fried bakmi (bami goreng) and prawn crackers (kroepoek). A suggestion is the famous Dutch-Indonesian rijsttafel, which is a combination of several small dishes from the East Indies, not unlike the nasi padang of Indonesia; a tradition that originated among Dutch colonists in the East Indies, where it died out following Indonesian independence, but was brought back to the Netherlands by returning colonists. Most of these restaurants have a sit-in area and a separate counter for take-away with lower prices. Most larger cities will have more authentic Indonesian and Chinese restaurants as well.\nArgentinian, French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Surinamese and Thai cuisines are also well-represented throughout the country. Most restaurants have at least one vegetarian dish on the menu or can make you one if you ask for it.\n\n\nSnackbars\nIn town centres, near public transport stations or even in more quiet quarters you can find a snackbar, sometimes known as cafetaria. These snackbars are pretty much the antithesis of high cuisine, but their snacks are considered typical for the country, and many Dutch ex-pats miss them the most when going abroad. Popular chain outlets have giant vending machines attached to their stores (automatiek). Just slot in a euro or two and take out the snack of your choice.\nThe most popular snack is French fries, known as patat in most of the country and as friet in the south.  The standard way is to order them with mayonnaise (patat met), although the local mayo is not the same as you'd get in France or most of the rest of the world. It is firmer, sweeter and contains less fat, whilst remaining just as unhealthy. Other options are with tomato ketchup, curry ketchup (unlike regular curry, tastes more like tomato ketchup), Indonesian peanut sauce (sat\u00e9saus), cut raw onions (uitjes), speciaal (mayonnaise, curry ketchup and cut raw onions) and oorlog (\"war\", a combination of mayonnaise, peanut sauce and cut raw onions).\nOther fried snacks are considered typical for the country as well. A croquette (kroket) is a crispy roll filled with ragout. It is served with mustard and can be ordered on bread as well. Famous are the Amsterdam croquettes of Van Dobben and Kwekkeboom. Both companies have their own cafeteria near the Rembrandtplein. A frikandel is a long, skinless and dark-coloured sausage, kind of like a minced-meat hot dog. It can be ordered on bread, or speciaal (with mayonnaise, curry ketchup and cut raw onions). A berenklauw (\"bear's claw\") or berenhap (\"bear's snack\") is a sliced meatball with fried onion rings on a wooden skewer, often served with peanut sauce. Finally, a kaassouffl\u00e9 is a cheese snack popular with vegetarians. Fastfood is widely available in the Netherlands as well. The most popular are  McDonalds and Burger King. Also KFC, Febo and Subway are well-known.\n\n\nSupermarkets\nIn the Netherlands, it is easy to get all of your food and drinks from a supermarket. Literally every city, town and village has at least one supermarket. The largest chain supermarkets with presence nationwide are Albert Heijn, Jumbo, Lidl, Plus and Aldi.  Dirk, Hoogvliet, Dekamarkt and Jan Linders have a more local presence.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nCoffee and tea\n\nDutch people are among the largest coffee drinkers in the world, and having a cup is almost compulsory when you are going to visit people. One of the first questions when coming through the door is often \"Koffie?\". Traditionally the drink is served in small cups (a half mug) with one single cookie. However, some guests are also treated with one of the country's typical pie-like pastries such as a tompouce, Limburgse vlaai or a piece of Dutch-style apple pie.\nDutch coffee is generally quite strong and heavy on the stomach. If you're from the United States or Canada, you can order one cup of Dutch coffee in the morning and add water the rest of the day! If you order koffie verkeerd (which means \"coffee wrong\") you get a cup of more or less half milk and half coffee, like the French 'caf\u00e9 au lait' or the Italian 'caffe latte'.\nThe Dutch drink black tea, and it comes in many different varieties, from traditional to fruit infusions. Luckily, if you're British, you get the teabag served with a cup of hot (but never boiling) water, so you can make your own version. Milk tea is almost unheard of and given only to children.\nHot chocolate with whipped cream is a winter tradition in the Netherlands. It really fills you after a cold walk. In the summer you can also get it in every decent bar; however, sometimes it's made from powder as opposed to the traditional kind (regular chocolate melted and mixed with hot milk), and doesn't taste that good.\n\n\nAlcoholic beverages\nThe legal drinking age in the Netherlands is 18 for all alcoholic beverages. There used to be a difference between light and strong alcoholic drinks, with people as young as 16 allowed to drink light alcoholic drinks (up to 15% alcohol by volume).\nThe Dutch have a strong beer culture. Heineken is one of the world's most famous beers, but it is just one of many brands in the Netherlands. You can get all kinds of beers from white beer to dark beer. Popular brands are Heineken, Grolsch, Brand, Bavaria, Amstel, etc. There's a certain regional variety in the beers you'll find. Heineken or Amstel is served in the western provinces, Bavaria or Dommelsch in Brabant, Brand in Limburg, and Grolsch in Gelderland and Overijssel. Most breweries nowadays also produce a non-alcoholic variant of their beers.\nIn addition to the usual lagers, try Dutch wheat beer (witbier), which is flavoured with a spice mix called gruit and thus taste different from the better-known pilsener varieties. Fruit-flavoured wheat beers are also available. Dark beers are brewed in monasteries in the south of the Netherlands (Brabant and Limburg). These traditional beer breweries are excellent beer-related tourist attractions, as are the microbreweries and beer shops in Amsterdam.\nBitters are popular in winter. Dutch gin (jenever or genever) is the predecessor of English gin. It is available in two types, oude (old) and jonge (young), which have nothing to do with aging, just the distillation style. The more traditional \"old-fashioned\" oude is sweeter and yellowish in colour, while jonge is clearer, drier and more akin to English gin.\nBeerenburg is made by adding herbs to jenever. It has an alcohol percentage of around 30%. The original Beerenburg was made halfway through the 19th century with a secret mixture of spices of the Amsterdam spice merchant Hendrik Beerenburg, to whom it owes its name. Despite it being \"invented\" in Amsterdam, it is considered typically Frisian. Most other regions also produce their local, less famous variants of a bitter. Orange bitter (Oranjebitter) is drunk only on King's Day (Koningsdag).\n\n\nNightlife\n\nNightlife in the Netherlands is very diverse. Amsterdam is known for its neighbourhood bars, Rotterdam has a clubbing reputation, and Groningen, Leiden and Utrecht have an active student scene. Bars cater to a wide array of music scenes, but dance is the leading style in nightclubs. Entering bars is legally allowed from the age of 16, but many bars and clubs have stricter policies in place and do not allow people under 18 or 21 to enter.\nThe Netherlands is renowned for its liberal drug policy.  Personal use of (soft) drugs is regulated by the Ministry of Justice under an official policy of gedogen; literally this means to accept or tolerate. Legally, this is a doctrine of non-prosecution on the basis that action taken would be so highly irregular as to constitute selective prosecution.\nYou are allowed to buy and smoke small doses (5 g or less) of cannabis or hash. You must be 18 or over to buy. For this you have to visit a coffeeshop, which are abundant in most larger towns. Coffeeshops are not allowed to sell alcohol, and minors (those under 18) are not allowed inside. Coffeeshops are prohibited from explicit advertising, so many use the Rastafari red-yellow-green colours to hint at the products available inside, while others are more discreet and sometimes almost hidden away from plain view.\nHallucinogenic (\"magic\") mushrooms, once legal, are officially banned. However, \"magic truffles\" or so called \"spacecakes\", which contain the same active ingredients as magic mushrooms, are still tolerated and are sold in some Amsterdam head shops.\nProstitution has been decriminalised, but only for those prostitutes registered at a permitted brothel. Safe sex and use of condoms is common practice, and the prostitute will usually have these available. It is illegal for sex workers to solicit customers on the street. Prostitution is most common in the capital, Amsterdam, with its red-light district, even if tourists only visit as a memento of their trip. In more rural areas, prostitution is almost non-existent.\n\n\nSleep\nA wide range of accommodation is available, concentrated in the major tourist destinations. They include regions popular for domestic tourism, such as the Veluwe and Zuid-Limburg.\n\n\nCamping\n\nCamp sites are widespread and available in pretty much all corners of the country, as well as close to most of the major cities. Outside the main tourist season (July\u2013September) there's usually a place available and most camp sites will find a spot for small trekker's tents any time of year. For caravans, camper vans or family tents it's advisable to make reservations beforehand, especially during summer holidays.\nIn popular domestic and regional tourist areas, such as on the coast, on the West Frisian Islands, in Zuid-Limburg and on the Veluwe, high end camp sites with lots of facilities and entertainment are easy to find. In rural areas, smaller sites next to farms are very popular (see Stichting Vrije Recreatie (SVR)). Pure natural landscapes can be vividly experienced on the so-called natuurkampeerterreinen (terrains for nature camping). As it comes to shopping facilities it might be possible to buy products of the place itself.\nSanitary facilities depend on the kind of camping site but quality is excellent for almost all of the campsites. On some camping sites the use of warm water is not included, but needs to be paid for at the showers. It's advisable to ask whether this is the case while checking in. Even without a tent you can enjoy staying at a camping. Many sites offer cabins called trekkershut.\nWild camping is not allowed and the police will enforce the law if broken. There used to be free \"pole camping\" (paalcamping) spots in parts of the country, but this is no longer the case.\n\n\nHotels\nHotels in the Netherlands are abundant, particularly in Holland proper, and can be relatively inexpensive compared to other Western European countries. You may be able to find a decent hotel of international standards for \u20ac80 or less per night. Due to good public transportation options, even staying outside of the city centre, or even in a different town altogether, may still be a viable option for visiting a particular destination comfortably while remaining within budget limits.\n\nWhile there are independent properties throughout the country, there is a relatively high presence of international and local hotel chains. Some of the more popular are:\n\n NH Hotels. The Spanish hotel chain inherited a lot of properties throughout Netherlands by taking over the former Krasnapolsky Hotels in Amsterdam and many of the former Golden Tulips. Thus, most of the properties are older, or even historic ones. NH Hoteles in larger cities are usually what one would expect of the chain in any other country; in smaller towns the properties are usually from the 1980s and only partially refurbished since then. You can always count on a very rich breakfast buffet, which is an NH Hoteles' trademark. NH Hoteles has the largest number of properties of all hotel chains in Amsterdam, which can be either helpful or disappointing in busy periods when hotels are prone to overbooking (you can be easily relocated to another NH Hotel across Amsterdam). Members of Aeromexico, Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas and Iberia frequent flyer schemes can collect award miles/kilometres for stays at NH Hoteles in the Netherlands. \nGolden Tulip/Tulip Inn  and Campanile \u2014 the remaining properties of the Dutch Tulip hotel chain now belong to the France-based Groupe du Louvre, which also operates Campanile hotels. Golden Tulips are mostly found in city centres and are of higher standards (four stars usually), Campaniles by motorway junctions and are more basic (two stars), Tulip Inns fall somewhere in between. Some properties may be rather aged, but can offer attractive rates if you don't mind them not being exactly up to snuff to their international competition. For those touring the Netherlands by automobile, Campaniles and Tulip Inns can help keep them within tighter budgets. Groupe du Louvre runs a loyalty programme\n Van der Valk Hotels. A local hotel chain operated by the Van der Valk family focuses on upscale accommodations and resort-like facilities. The hotels are therefore usually of high standard and comfort and often feature swimming pools and other leisure facilities, but can also be quite far away from city centres. There is no loyalty scheme for guests in Van der Valk hotels, but there are often leisure-themed packages offered, which include stays and additional services or attractions. \n Hampshire Hotels. With over 80 properties, including 3 in Germany and 8 in Belgium, this is one of the largest hotel chains in the Netherlands. The standards of the hotels vary from basic three-star properties to more upscale, and often historic, Hampshire Eden and Hampshire Classic hotels. The chain does not operate a loyalty scheme, and members of most frequent flyer programmes will not be able to acquire miles for stays with Hampshire Hotels. \n Bastion Hotels. A chain of highly uniform, limited-service hotels targeting road warriors who tour the Netherlands by car on business. Most of the hotels have been purpose-built in the 1990s or later, and are reminiscent of other hotel chains of similar character that can be found across Europe, like ibis hotels or Premier Inn. Usually to be found around motorways, with sometimes poor access to public transportation. While limited-service, most feature an on-site restaurant open throughout the day. (updated Jan 2019)\n Accor. Has a sizeable presence in the Netherlands, in particular with their Ibis, Novotel and Mercure brands. As in other countries, Mercures are often formerly independent three- or four-star properties that have joined the chain. (updated Aug 2022)\nThe Intercontinental Hotels Group has increased its presence by opening all-new Holiday Inn Express properties in key locations across the country, with competitive rates including breakfast. There are also older Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza properties in major cities.\nOther international hotel chains do maintain some presence in the Netherlands, though this is mostly limited to Amsterdam and Schiphol airport. There are also quite a few Best Western-affiliated properties throughout the Netherlands, but as in every country, they vary greatly in character, size, pricing and comfort.\nShowers are slightly different from the American style. Bar soap is not very popular; most of what is provided in hotels and mainstream stores is liquid body soap. Washcloths are also generally not available, but washing mitts are available in stores. European-style bathrooms often have no edge on the shower floor, allowing water to get on the floor in the other parts of the bathroom (be prepared to mop up with a floor towel if someone needs the toilet right after someone showers). Shower heads are generally hand-held on flexible hoses, and there are separate controls for water temperature vs. volume (instead of hot and cold knobs or a single temperature lever typically seen in the U.S.).\n\n\nBed and breakfast\nThere is a wide choice of bed & breakfasts in the big cities, but there are also plenty to be found in the smaller towns and villages. Prices are generally \u20ac40-100, depending on the number of occupants and the season. Bed & breakfasts may not offer all the facilities that bigger hotels do, but the service is generally friendly and personal. Also, many bed & breakfasts are found along popular hiking trails and cycling paths.\n\n\nBudget\nEven for budget facilities prices are generally high. Budget accommodation starts at around \u20ac20 per person and prices go upwards from there. Seasonal demand affects availability and can cause prices to rise, especially in Amsterdam.\nOfficial Dutch Youth Hostels are called \"Stay Okay\", but they are not as widespread as in Great Britain. Also there is no kitchen available for guests, so either you eat what's on menu or you eat out. Besides the Official Dutch Youth Hostels there are plenty of other hostels spread around the country. Many hostels have regulations for travellers under the age of 18. In some cases they must be accompanied by an adult and in others they cannot book beds in shared rooms. Make sure to check with the hostel of your choice. Sheets are often included but the use of towels typically comes at a charge.\nIn nature areas the local landscape can be experienced at so called Natuurvriendenhuizen (Friends of nature houses) . These facilities are somehow in between hostels and general hotels and are especially open for cyclers and hikers, including groups. They are run by volunteers and visitors, and have communal kitchen facilities and contagious living rooms.\nShort-term apartment rental is available in cities, but may not be legal. While most have a 3-night minimum stay, the process of making reservations and checking in is generally identical to that of staying in a hotel, the notable exception being that most require a credit card deposit, and the balance in cash on arrival.\nIf you are travelling by bicycle or by foot, there is a list of 3,600 addresses where you can stay at private homes with bed and breakfast for no more than \u20ac18.50 per person per night, although you must also pay \u20ac8 for membership of this scheme. It is called Vrienden op de fiets.\n\n\nVacation rental homes (bungalows)\nVacation rental homes (in Dutch also called bungalows) are popular in the Netherlands, especially in rural areas. These small homes come in broad varieties: they can be simple or luxurious, individual places or part of large parks with lots of identical homes and they are operated by private owners as well as large chains. Traversia has the largest collection of vacation rentals in the Netherlands, by Dutch owners. Large chains of vacation rental home parks are Center Parks, Landal Greenparks and TopParken. Where privately owned options can sometimes provide a more authentic, local experience (e.g. in old, timber-framed houses in South Limburg), the parks will offer additional services, restaurants and swimming pools. In most cases, you have to book at least a weekend. Although generally not very cheap, they have kitchens and therefore allow for self-catering.\n\n\nLearn\nThe Netherlands has many universities. The country has converted their own titles into the bachelor/master system.\nThere are two types of universities:\n\nAcademic (focusing more on theoretical knowledge, \"Universiteit\")\nApplied Sciences (focussing more on practical knowledge, \"Hogeschool\"). Although these generally use the term university in their English names, under Dutch law, these are not universities, and are a lower level of tertiary education.\nThe Times Higher Education Supplement ranks 11 universities among the top 200 in the world.\nMost undergraduate courses are taught in Dutch, though many postgraduate courses are taught in English. The universities also provide courses in the Dutch language for international students.\nThere is also the added advantage that most locals under the age of 30 are reasonably capable in English.\nFor international students, several scholarships are available.\nThey can be found on the Nuffic website. Here you will also find information regarding courses, institutions, housing, formalities, culture, traineeships and possible difficulties.\n\n\nWork\n\nCitizens of all EEA countries and Switzerland have an unrestricted right to work in the Netherlands. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nWork opportunities for those from outside the EEA are very restricted. Only when an employer can prove they've searched in the EU, they are allowed to hire a non-EU citizen. Official policy is to deter all non-EU immigration, unless there is an economic necessity.\nCitizens of certain non-EU countries are permitted to work in the Netherlands without the need to obtain a visa or any further authorisation for the period of their 90-day visa-free stay.\nStudents from other European countries are eligible for study financing only when they have a fixed 56-hour/month work contract or when they have lived in the Netherlands for five years.\nFor highly skilled workers that exceed a certain salary threshold and meet other conditions, there is a 30% tax ruling which means that only 70% of your income will be considered for tax purposes. This is most useful when you're working in the Netherlands for the first time, and has other associated benefits (such as the option to transfer a foreign driving licence rather than having to retake the driving test to obtain a Dutch licence).\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nCrime\nThe Netherlands is generally considered a safe country. However, be alert in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and other large cities that are plagued by pickpockets and bicycle theft; violent crimes are rare. In the larger cities, certain outlying suburbs are considered unsafe at night.\nThe police, ambulance and fire brigade have one general emergency number 112. When calling 112, if you can, advise on what emergency services you need.\nPolicing is provided by the national police corps (Politie), while border controls and port and airport security are handled by a separate police force, the Marechaussee (or abbreviation 'KMar' - Koninklijke Marechaussee). They are part of the military and have security tasks among their duties.\nIn most cities, there are municipal service officers which can be recognised by their blue uniforms with the text handhaving. They have the authority to enforce municipal laws and may carry a baton and/or pepper spray, but no firearm. Some cities also have officers which are further limited in authority, such as parking enforcement only. These have the text toezicht or parkeercontrole on their uniform and/or car.\nThe European Network against Racism, an international organisation supported by the European Commission reported that, in the Netherlands, half of the Turks reported having experienced racial discrimination. The same report points out a \"dramatic growth of Islamophobia\" paralleled with antisemitism. Attitudes such as these, however, relate to issues with settling migrants rather than tourists, and visitors of a minority background will not find their ethnicity an issue in a country famed for its tolerance.\n\n\nDrugs\n\nSee also: Cannabis\nCannabis may be decriminalised, but there are some safety risks involved. It is wise to take your first spliff in a relaxed social atmosphere, for example among like-minded people in a coffeeshop. Cannabis sold in the Netherlands is often stronger than varieties elsewhere. Be particularly wary of cannabis-laced pastries (\"space cakes\") as it's easy to eat too much by accident \u2014 although there are also unscrupulous shops that sell space cakes with no weed at all. Wait at least one hour after eating!\nIt is forbidden to drive any motorised vehicle while impaired, which includes driving under the influence of both illegal and legal recreational or prescribed drugs (such as cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis and mushrooms) as well as alcohol, and medication that might affect your ability to drive.\nBuying soft drugs from dealers in the streets is always illegal and is commonly discouraged. The purchase of other (hard) drugs such as  ecstasy, cocaine, or processed/dried mushrooms is still dealt with by the law. However, often people who are caught in possession of small amounts of illegal drugs for personal use are not prosecuted.\nThe act of consuming any form of drugs is legal, even if possession is not. If you are seen taking drugs, you may theoretically be arrested for possession, but not for use. This has one important effect; do not hesitate to seek medical help if you are suffering from bad effects of drug use, and inform emergency services as soon as possible of the specific (illegal) drugs you have taken. Medical services are unconcerned with where you got the drugs, they will not contact the police, their sole intention is to take care of you in the best way possible. As some substances can interact (negatively) with others or certain procedures become dangerous under the influence of certain substances, this may well save your life!\nAt some parties, a \"drug testing desk\" is offered, where you can have your (synthetic) drugs tested. This is mainly because many pills contain harmful chemicals in addition to the claimed ingredients; for example, many pills of \"ecstasy\" (MDMA) will also contain speed (amphetamines). Some pills don't even contain any MDMA at all. The testing desks are not meant to encourage drug use, since venue owners face stiff fines for allowing drugs in their venues, but they are tolerated or 'gedoogd' since they mitigate the public health risks. The desk won't return the drugs tested.\nThere are significant risks associated with drug use:\n\nWhile marijuana bought at coffeeshops is unlikely to be hazardous, hard drugs like cocaine and heroin and synthetic drugs like ecstasy are still illegal and unregulated. These hard drugs are likely to be in some way contaminated, especially when bought from street dealers.\nSome countries have legislation in place that make it illegal to plan a trip to another country for the purpose of committing  acts illegal under their jurisdiction, so you might be apprehended in your home country after having legally smoked pot in the Netherlands.\nBe very careful with alcohol and weed. Don't use any alcohol the first couple of times you smoke weed: drinking one beer after you've smoked can feel like drinking ten beers. Alcohol and weed amplify each other: a little bit of alcohol can cause you to intensely feel the effect of the weed, but a tiny bit too much can make you feel dizzy and/or nauseated.\nThe use of drugs is condemned, disapproved of and even feared by many Dutch people, notwithstanding the approach the criminal justice system has taken for decades. Nowadays, smoking is also frowned upon.\n\n\nProstitution\nProstitution in the Netherlands is legalised as long as it concerns voluntary interactions between adults. The minimum age for sex workers is 18 years. Exploiting sex workers or engaging them in the industry against their will is a crime. Street prostitution is prohibited in most municipalities, although Utrecht, Arnhem, Groningen, Heerlen, Nijmegen and Eindhoven allow it on dedicated \"tippelzones\". While brothels are permitted by law, most cities require them to have permits and enforce a maximum number of establishments in a limited part of town. Research has concluded that drug addictions are more common in the street bound activities. A client who makes use of sexual services when he could have suspected an illegal situation is already punishable by law, and more explicit legal provisions about the responsibilities of the client are in the making. Reasonable suspicion could include timid or young girls, (small) injuries but also suspicious locations such as industrial areas or garage boxes. Illegal prostitution in hotels can be raided by the police and the client as well as the prostitute can be fined or be put in jail. Hotel personnel are obliged by law to notify the police if they suspect these kinds of illegal activities. In short, it's advisable to only have paid sex in locations with a licence to host prostitutes and to ask for an ID when you have any doubts about a person's age.\n\n\nStay healthy\nThe Netherlands has some of the best tap water in the world. It is even considered to be of similar or better quality than bottled natural mineral or spring water due to high standards that are strictly enforced and are even more strict than the already high food standards. Due to the high quality of both the water production and the distribution network, there is no need to add chlorine.\nAt the majority of the train stations and even in some natural reserves, there is a water tap point, where the water is also of very good quality. Food (either bought in a supermarket or eaten at a restaurant) shouldn't pose any problems either.\nThe health care system of the Netherlands is up to par with the rest of Europe. Hospitals are mostly situated in larger cities, and all have English-speaking medical staff. General practitioners can be found in almost all towns, except for small villages, and they can typically speak English too. In case of a potential life-threatening emergency: call 112 and if necessary an ambulance will be send and bring you to the most suitable emergency department (Dutch: Spoedeisende Hulp/SEH) of a hospital. In case of a non-life-threatening emergency call the local GP (Dutch: Huisarts) during office hours or the night GP (Dutch: Huisartsenpost) after office hours. If necessary the GP will send an ambulance or make a referal to the most suitable emergency department. If you have a non-life-treatening emergency do not go to the emergency department without referral as you will be denied access until a GP has seen you first. \nTwo health risks are particularly relevant for travellers:\n\nWhen walking or camping in forests and dunes, be aware of ticks and tick-carrying diseases. It is advisable to wear long sleeves and to put trousers into your socks. If you discover a red ring on your body in the following weeks, be sure to visit a doctor to check for Lyme disease, which can be lethal without proper medical care.\nIn summer, open air recreational (mainly fresh water) swimming areas might suffer from the notorious blue algae, a rather smelly cyanobacteria which when it dies, releases toxins into the water. When these occur, a signpost at the entrance to the area or near the water should tell you so by stating something like \"Waarschuwing: blauwalg\". If in doubt, ask someone.\n\n\nRespect\nThe Dutch are supposed to be the most informal and easy-going people in Europe and there are few strict social taboos to speak of. It's unlikely that Dutch people will be offended simply by your behaviour or appearance. In fact, it's more likely that visitors themselves will be offended by overly direct conversation. Nevertheless, the standards for overt rudeness and hostility are similar to those in other western European countries.\nThe exception to this openness is personal wealth. For instance, it's considered vulgar to reveal how rich you are, so asking somebody about this will be considered nosy and will probably just get you an evasive answer.\nLikewise, it's not advisable to be forceful about your own religion or to assume a Dutch person you've met is a Catholic or a Calvinist, since most people do not adhere to any faith at all. In urban areas it's not considered rude to ask somebody about this, but you'll generally be expected to be entirely tolerant of whatever the other person believes and not attempt to proselytise in any way. Openly religious behaviour is usually met with bewilderment and ridicule rather than hostility. An exception is the Dutch Bible Belt which runs from Zeeland into South Holland, Utrecht and Gelderland, and consists of towns with many strong Dutch Reformed Christians, who are more likely to be insulted by different religious views.\nOpenly nationalist sentiments are likewise viewed with some suspicion among the general public, although there are a number of celebrations like King's Day (Koningsdag, 27 April) and during football championships. Some people dress in orange and/or get drunk, but you don't have to fear hostility to foreigners.\nNever refer to the entire country as \"Holland\", as that name only refers to the two provinces of North and South Holland, and doing so may offend Dutch people from or related to the other provinces. However, the country as a whole calls itself \"Holland\" towards tourists. Generally speaking, people from Flevoland and Utrecht won't bother correcting you when you refer to them as \"Hollander\" or their region as \"Holland\". Don't expect anyone from a province other than those four to be flattered when being called a \"Hollander\". It can never hurt to ask whether anyone present minds.\n\n\nSocial etiquette\nIn the Netherlands, cheek-kissing is a common way of greeting among women and between women and men. Two men will generally shake hands. Kissing is particularly suitable for informal occasions. For greetings, it's typically used for people who are already acquainted. It's also common practice when congratulating someone, and is common among strangers in that case too. Hand shaking is more appropriate for formal occasions. Trying to shake hands when offered a kiss or refusing a kiss altogether could be considered odd or rude.\nDutch people will kiss three times alternating right and left cheeks. This could lead to awkward situations for British people and many other Europeans, being used to just two kisses. Also, always kiss on the cheeks instead of giving air-kisses.\n\n\nGay and lesbian travellers\n\nAs mentioned above, the Netherlands is liberal when it comes to homosexuality and is considered to be one of the most gay-friendly countries in the world. The Netherlands has a reputation of being the first country to recognise same-sex marriage, and openly displaying your orientation won't cause much upset in the Netherlands.\nHowever, even a gay friendly country like the Netherlands has room for some criticisms of homosexuality, but this varies depending on where one travels. If you express opposition to LGBT rights, Dutch people might make politely clear to you that they do not agree with your thoughts. Don't get mistaken by Dutch using 'gay' ('homo') as a swearword, it is vastly used by LGBT people themselves. Although most Dutch people are very tolerant of the LGBT community, occasions in which openly gay people are beaten up are not unheard of.\n\n\nConnect\nThe country code for the Netherlands is 31. The outbound international prefix is 00 (e.g. to call the US, substitute 00 1 for +1 and for the UK  00 44 for +44.)\nThe cellular phone networks in the Netherlands are operated by KPN, Vodafone and T-Mobile; other operators use one of these 3 networks. All providers offer 4G coverage in almost every corner of the Netherlands, and 5G is at almost the same level. Note that 3G networks have been turned off, and 2G is only available at KPN and Vodafone, mainly for business purposes.\nIf you're bringing your own (GSM) cell phone to call (or receive calls) whilst in the Netherlands, make sure to check the relevant \"roaming\" charges for your provider, as they vary substantially. Receiving phone calls on a cell phone using a Dutch SIM card is free in most cases; charges may apply if you're using a foreign SIM card, as the call is theoretically routed through your country of origin. It may be cheaper to buy a pay-as-you-go SIM card to insert into your GSM phone, or even to buy a very cheap pay-as-you-go card+phone bundle. Providers that specialise in discount rates to foreign countries include Lyca, Lebara, Ortel and Vectone.\nTo enjoy cheap international calls from the Netherlands you can use low-cost dial-around services such as Qazza, BelBazaar,  pennyphone  , SlimCall, telegoedkoop, beldewereld, teleknaller  . Dial-around services are directly available from any landline in the Netherlands. No contract, no registration is required. Most dial-around services offer USA, Canada, Western Europe and many other countries at the price of a local call so you can save on your phone expenses easily. They also work from public payphones.\nAs of January 2023, there are no public phone booths left in the Netherlands.\n0800 numbers are toll-free while 09xx numbers are charged at premium rates. Mobile phones have numbers in the 06 range, and calls to cell phones are also priced at higher rates. (National) Directory Inquiries can be reached via 1888, 1850 and various other 'Inquiry-operators'. Rates differ by operator, but are usually rather high, more than \u20ac1 per call, as well as per-second charges. International Directory Inquiries can be reached on 0900 8418 (M-F 08:00-20:00, \u20ac0.90 per minute). Phone numbers can also be found on the Internet, free of charge, on Telefoonboek.nl, De Telefoongids.nl and for opening times visit Openingstijden.nl or OpeningstijdenGids.nl.\n\n\nInternet access\nKPN, Vodafone and T-Mobile offer  near-complete 4G coverage. 5G networks are nearing completion. Other service providers, using the networks of the aforementioned operators, may offer a slower connection for lower prices.\nDutch sim cards are also available with mobile internet access, typically from \u20ac10 for 1 GB and a month validity.  Users with a mobile phone account from an EU country can use their data plan in the Netherlands without incurring extra charges.\nInternet caf\u00e9s are increasingly rare but can still be found in major cities and usually also provide international calling booths. Many public libraries provide Internet access, usually at a charge. Wireless Internet access using Wi-Fi is quite widely available. It's usually a free service in pubs, restaurants and many attractions. In hotels the situation differs, with free service in some and high rates in others. Free Wi-Fi is offered in many of the larger railway stations, a growing number of NS intercity trains, local trains of some of the other operators, and some regional buses, and Schiphol offers limited free service as well as better (and longer) use for a charge.\n\n\nMail\nPostNL has been assigned by the government to provide universal postal service in The Netherlands, including delivery of mail in the country and provide sufficient post boxes throughout the country for sending mail.\nAt service points, called PostNL-punten, you can buy stamps, send mail and send parcels.\nInternational stamps  have a \u2018priority\u2019 indication, a number instead of a euro value and the word \u2018internationaal\u2019 on them.  The weight of your letter or postcard determines the number of stamps you need.  Mail up to 20 grams requires one internationaal stamp which as of January 2024 costs \u20ac1.75.\nDigital postal stamps are available: you pay for the postage using the PostNL mobile app, then write the provided 12-digit code on the envelope, instead of using a physical stamp.\nGoods may no longer be sent internationally via regular mail but must be pre-registered. PostNL offers parcel services internationally but may be more expensive or may take longer than courier services such als DHL, DPD and UPS which also operate in the Netherlands.",
