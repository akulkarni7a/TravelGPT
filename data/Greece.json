Travellers from all over the world visit Greece to view its rich cultural past and magnificent natural settings, which include majestic mountains and beaches.\nGreece offers everything, whether you're a history buff, a sun seeker, or just searching for an amazing trip.\n\n\nRegions\nGreece is both a mountainous and coastal country, with countless islands spread over the Ionian and Aegean seas.\n\n\nCities\n\nMajor cities include:\n\n1 Athens (\u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, Ath\u00edna) \u2014 the capital and largest city, known for the Parthenon\n2 Chania (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac) \u2014 surrounded by beaches and the Samaria National Park\n3 Chersonissos (\u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2) \u2014 party capital of Crete in the summer\n4 Heraklion (\u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf, Ir\u00e1kleio) \u2014 Crete's largest city and main hub with the archaeological site of Knossos\n5 Kavala (\u039a\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1) \u2014 romantic port city in East Macedonia with many sights and ferry port to the North Aegean Islands.\n6 Patras (\u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1) \u2014 third largest city in Greece, known for its wine production\n7 Rhodes (\u03a1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, R\u00f3dos) \u2014 impressive medieval structures, nightlife and beaches\n8 Thessaloniki (\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7) \u2014 second largest city, the main city in the central Macedonia region\n9 Volos (\u0392\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) \u2014 coastal port with nice museums and architecture\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Crete (\u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7) \u2014 the largest island in Greece\n2 Corfu (\u039a\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1, K\u00e9rkyra) \u2014 large island with many attractions\n3 Delphi (\u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03af) \u2014 site of the famous oracle of Apollo, major archaeological site\n4 Meteora (\u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1) \u2014 hilltop monasteries\n5 Mount Athos (\u0386\u03b8\u03c9\u03c2, \u00c1thos) \u2014 semi-independent republic, home to many Orthodox monasteries (access restricted)\n6 Mykonos (\u039c\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) \u2014 world famous, sophisticated holidays\n7 Olympia (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03af\u03b1) \u2014 sanctuary dedicated to Zeus, site of the ancient Olympics\n8 Rhodes (\u03a1\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, R\u00f3dos) \u2014 island with ancient monuments, as well as beaches\n9 Santorini (\u03a3\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 or \u0398\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1, Thira) \u2014 a volcanic island known for its beautiful views, towns and sunsets\nSee also the UNESCO World Heritage sites in Greece\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nVisitors are drawn to the country's beaches and reliable sunny summer weather, its nightlife, historical sites and natural beauty. In 2018, Greece received 33 million visitors, more than three visitors for each of the country's residents.\n\nThe majority of visitors come to Greece from other European countries, although tourists from other world regions have been increasing in number. The vast majority of visitors visit from April through to October. Peak season is between May and September when approximately 75% of all tourists arrive. Most of the tourists and tourism industry are concentrated in Crete, the Dodecanese, Cyclades, and Western Greek Islands, and to a lesser extent the Peloponnese and the Halkidiki peninsula in Macedonia. There are still many rewarding areas in the country free of large-scale tourism.\nMany first-time visitors arrive in Greece with specific images in mind and are surprised to discover a country with such regional and architectural diversity. The famous whitewashed homes and charming blue-domed churches only characterise a specific region of the country (the Cyclades Islands). Architecture varies greatly from one region to the next depending on the local history. Visitors will find Neoclassical architecture in the cities of Ermoupolis and Nafplion, Ottoman-influenced buildings in Greven\u00e1 and Koz\u00e1ni, whitewashed Cycladic homes on the island of Paros, and pastel-coloured baroque homes and churches on Corfu. The nation's terrain is just as varied as its architectural heritage: idyllic beaches, towering mountain ranges, wine-producing valleys, vast stretches of olive orchards in the south, and lush forests in the north. Greece's historical sights are just as varied; the country is littered with just as many medieval churches and castles as classical ruins and temples.\nIt borders Albania, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Turkey.\n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Ancient Greece\nGreece boasts a very long history, with the Greek language being spoken in the country and throughout the Mediterranean region for nearly 4000 years.\n\n\nFirst civilisations\nThe country's first inhabitants are now referred to as the Pelasgians. Little is known about them, but it is believed that they were a primitive people. The first advanced civilisations in Greece are known as the Cycladic in the Cyclades Islands, and the Minoan in Crete and Santorini. The Minoans had a written language which remains undecipherable to archaeologists, which is one of the most interesting and profound historical mysteries.\n\n\nDark Ages\nGreek-speaking Indo-European peoples arrived in the country from somewhere to the north, around 1700 BC, and slowly invaded the entire country from the north all the way to Crete, as well as the west coast of Asia Minor (now Turkey), absorbing the native peoples. Their arrival may have been responsible for ending the Cycladic and Minoan civilisations and brought the country into what is now referred to as the Dark Age of ancient Greece; although it is now understood among historians that civilisation in Greece remained sophisticated and advanced during this time. The first Greek-speaking civilisation, Mycenean, was centred in the Peloponnese region.\nAs they do today, many ancient Greeks made a living from the sea. They were accomplished fishers, sailors and traders and the sea has profoundly shaped Greek culture.\n\n\nClassical Greece\nSee also: Trojan War\nThe rise of the Greek city-states occurred in the period 1200 to 800 BC and heralded the Golden Age of Greece, which lasted many centuries and spurred several scientific, architectural, political, economic, artistic, and literary achievements. Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes were the most prominent of the city-states (with Athens being the most prestigious), but there were several other advanced city-states and colonies that had developed across the Aegean basin. Greek settlements were also established in southern Italy and other coastal areas of the Mediterranean colonised by Greeks. The legacy of Greek Civilisation from this time period made a major impact on the world and continues to influence us to this day with the development of democracy, philosophy and theatre.\n\n\nHellenistic and Roman eras\nThe epicentre of Greek Civilisation shifted, during the 4th century BC, from southern Greece to northern Greece. The northern Macedonian kingdom, under Alexander the Great, conquered all of Greece, and proceeded eastward, conquering all the way to South Asia with the intent of expanding the Greek empire. The empire broke up after Alexander's death, and Greece was eventually annexed by the growing Roman Empire. Although weakened politically, Greek culture continued to flourish under Roman rule and indeed heavily influenced Roman culture.\n\n\nArrival of Christianity and rise of Byzantine Empire\nChristianity arrived in Greece with the preachings of St. Paul during the 1st century AD, and eventually spread throughout Greece and the Roman Empire. In the 4th century, Roman Emperor Constantine the Great legalised Christian worship and declared it the state religion of the empire. He moved the capital of the empire from Rome to Byzantium (present-day Istanbul), which he renamed Constantinople. Internal divisions eventually divided the Roman Empire into a western half (the West Roman Empire) and an eastern half (East Roman Empire.) The West was eventually invaded and sacked by invaders from northern Europe, while the East survived for another millennium as the Byzantine Empire with Constantinople as its capital.\n\n\nMedieval Greece\nGreece's medieval history is dominated by the Byzantine Empire which revolved around Christianity, Greek Language and Roman law. It was a powerful force in the Mediterranean basin for centuries, engaging in trade, politics, and the spread of Christianity. The empire collaborated with Rome during the Crusades against the Muslims. However, during the 13th century, the Crusaders turned on the Byzantine Empire itself and sacked Constantinople. With a weakened Byzantine Empire, Frankish and Latin invaders arrived and occupied various parts of Greece. Over the following centuries, the Byzantine Empire began to regain strength and reconquer lost territory, but received a final blow in the 15th century when a growing Ottoman Turkish Empire to the east captured Constantinople.\n\n\nOttoman rule\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Greece fell under Ottoman Turkish rule, but vigorously retained its Greek-speaking Christian culture. However, many Greeks fled the country, establishing Greek communities elsewhere in Europe; these communities would later influence the Greek Revolution.\n\n\nEnlightenment and revolution\nThe Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice competed with the Ottoman Turks for control of various areas of Greece and managed to conquer various islands and coastal areas, bringing pan-European movements such as the Renaissance (and later the Enlightenment) to places in Greece such as Crete, Corfu, and parts of the Peloponnese region. In the 18th century, the Enlightenment, both in Venetian/Genoese-occupied areas of Greece and from Greek communities abroad, led to an awakening among prominent Greeks and gave birth to the goal of an independent, unified, and sovereign Greek state. The Greek Revolution finally broke out on the 25th of March, 1821, and led to a long war against the Ottomans for independence. The Greek Revolution gained attention across Europe, with Russia, Britain, and France sending military aid to assist Greece.\n\n\n19th to mid-20th century\nThe nation finally achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. The newly-independent Greek State was briefly a republic, before becoming a monarchy at the will of major European powers. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, Greece gradually annexed neighbouring islands and territories with Greek-speaking populations. However, its try at Asia Minor ended in defeat and a large-scale exodus from Turkey to Greece. The instability that followed led to a military coup, reinstatement of monarchy and an authoritarian rule. About 15,000 people were arrested and jailed or exiled for political reasons during the 4th of August Regime 1936\u20131941.\nThe country sided with the allies during World War I. Despite declaring neutrality during World War II, the country was invaded by Mussolini's forces on 28 October 1940. Greek forces victoriously pushed the Italians out of Greece, but the Germans then came to their aid, occupying the country until its liberation toward the end of the war. The resistance movement was one of the strongest in Nazi-occupied Europe, controlling much of the countryside, and the occupation brutal. Civil war broke out in 1946 between communist rebels and royalists, the former supported by Yugoslavia (until the Tito-Stalin rift of 1948) and the latter by the West. The communist rebels were defeated by the royalists in 1949. The second world war and the civil war that followed had left the country war-torn, forcing many people to flee the country in search of a better life abroad.\nGreece joined NATO in 1952; rapid economic growth and social change followed. A right-wing military dictatorship staged a coup in 1967, disbanding all political parties, suspending political liberties and forcing many prominent Greeks into exile, including Communists, who played an active part in the Greek Parliament before and after the junta. King Constantine II and his family also fled the country. Democracy returned in 1974, and a national referendum abolished the monarchy, creating a parliamentary republic.\n\n\nModern Greece\nGreece joined the European Community in 1981, which later became the European Union (EU) in 1992. The country's tourism industry \u2013 which had begun to take off during the 1960s \u2013 began to flourish, bringing 5 million annual visitors to the country in 1980 (a figure that eventually grew to over 17 million by 2007). The country suffered serious economic stagnation in the 1980s, but began to experience remarkable economic growth in the 1990s, fuelled by heavy investment, entrepreneurship, trade, and EU aid.\nBy the early 21st century, Greece had seemingly achieved stability and prosperity, with a high standard of living. An influx of immigrants began in the late 1980s, transforming Greece, once an immigrant-sender, into an immigrant-receiving country. Foreign-born residents, most of them undocumented and coming from various parts of the world (Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa) are estimated to number at least 1 million, or equivalent to 10% of the population. In 2004, the nation stepped into the global spotlight as it successfully hosted the Summer Olympic Games in Athens, to the defiance of critics. Greece however, has borne the brunt of the late-2000s recession and related 2010 European sovereign debt crisis.\nThe main issues facing Greek society are a high and growing level of bureaucratic corruption, high unemployment, sluggish economic growth and widespread poverty. As a by-product of the ongoing economic depression, there has also been a rise in extremism. Particularly worrying is the rise in support for Golden Dawn, a violently xenophobic opposition party that has often been described as neo-Nazi, some of whose members of Parliament have been arrested for beating foreigners in the street, and which has reportedly gained a considerable degree of control over some Greek police forces. This is unlikely to affect most travellers, but if you could be mistaken for a refugee or illegal migrant to Greece, think twice about whether now is the right time to visit (also refer to \u00a7 Stay safe). As of 2020, this party has been declared a criminal organization, and has ceased to exist, with most of its important members found guilty in court and sentenced to prison.\n\n\nClimate\nDespite its small size, Greece has a varied climate.\nMost of the country, including all coastal areas, enjoys a so-called Mediterranean climate, almost identical to much of California. Summers are hot and dry with a 7-month period of near-constant sunshine generally from April until November. The remainder of the year is characterised by a relatively cold, rainy period which generally starts sometime in November and lasts until late March or early April. Sporadic rains do occur during the dry season, but they tend to be rare, quick showers. The country\u2019s Ionian Coast and Ionian Islands tend to receive more annual precipitation than the rest of the country. The islands in the southern Aegean and parts of the southeastern mainland are the driest areas of the country.\nThe most pleasant weather occurs in May\u2013June and September\u2013October. The warmest time of the year starts in mid-July and generally lasts until mid-August, when the annual melt\u00e9mi winds from the north cool the country. Mid-July to mid-August is the height of summer, and the midday sun tends to get very strong; during this time, most Greeks avoid heavy physical activity outdoors between 13:00 and 17:00. It is best advised to get in tune with the local way of life by waking up early, doing all sightseeing and errands in the cool morning hours, and then spending the afternoon in the relaxing shade or at the beach. In fact, the bulk of tourists arrive in Greece during the height of summer, to do just that! For visitors from more northerly climates, the off season from November through February can be a rewarding time to see Greece. It will not be beach weather, but temperatures are mild. The much added bonus is that there will be very few other tourists and reduced prices.\nSummer evenings tend to be very rewarding. As strong as the sun may get on a summer afternoon, the low levels of atmospheric humidity in most areas of the country prevent the air from trapping much heat, and temperatures tend to dip to very pleasant levels in the evenings. But even during midday, high temperatures actually tend to be quite comfortable as long as the time is not spent doing a lot of walking or other physical activity. (Athens, however, can still be uncomfortably warm during summer afternoons due to the predominance of concrete in the city, an effect similar to New York City.) Coastal areas near open waters (away from tightly-closed bays and gulfs), especially on many of the islands, tend to be quite breezy, and can be quite cold at night.\nWhile the Mediterranean climate characterises most of the country, two other climate systems are present. One is the cool Alpine climate which is found on mountainous areas of the country's interior, including many high-altitude valleys. Another system is the Continental climate found on the interiors of north-central and northeastern Greece, which gives those areas very cold winters and warm, relatively humid summers.\nGreek weather forecast given here \n\n\nHolidays and festivals\n\nThe following are national public holidays:\n\nNew Year's Day - 1 Jan\nEpiphany - 6 Jan\nClean Monday (First day of Lent) - movable\nIndependence Day and The Annunciation - 25 Mar\nHoly Friday - movable\nPascha Sunday - movable\nPascha Monday - movable\nMay Day / Labour Day - 1 May\nPentecost Sunday - movable\nPentecost Monday - movable\nDormition of the Theotokos - 15 Aug\nWWII Day / \"OHI(no) Day\" - 28 Oct\nChristmas - 25 Dec\nBoxing Day - 26 Dec\nThe nation's three most important holidays are Christmas, Pascha, and the Dormition. Christmas tends to be a private, family holiday, but lights and decorations adorn city squares across the country. Dormition is a major summer festival for many towns and islands. Pascha weekend is perhaps the most flamboyant of all holidays; religious processions on Holy Friday and the following Saturday evening culminate in exuberant fireworks at midnight, Easter morning.\nContrary to most national holidays in other countries, Independence Day in Greece is a very sober holiday. There is a school flag parade in every town and village and a big armed forces parade in Athens.\nAlthough not an official holiday, pre-Lenten carnival - or ap\u00f3kries - is a major celebration in cities throughout the country, with Patras and Xanthi hosting the country's largest and most famous events. Carnival season comes to an extravagant ending the weekend before Lent begins, with costumes, float parades, and various regional traditions.\nIn addition to nation-wide holidays and celebrations, many towns and regions have their own regional festivals commemorating various historical events, local patron saints, or wine harvests.\nThe Greek Orthodox Church uses a different method to determine the date of Easter from the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. Therefore, Greek Orthodox Pascha and, derived from that, Holy Week and Pentecost usually fall one or two weeks later than their Roman Catholic and Protestant counterparts, but they do sometimes coincide (as in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2017 and 2025).\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Greece\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Greek phrasebook\nGreek is the official national language and is the native tongue of the vast majority of the population, although the English speaking visitor will encounter no significant language problem. English is the most widely studied and understood foreign language in Greece, followed by French, Italian, and German. Basic knowledge of English can be expected from almost all in the tourism industry and public transport services. Learning a few Greek terms, such as \"hello\" and \"thank you\" will be warmly received.\nThe Latin and Cyrillic alphabets were derived from the Greek alphabet and about half of Greek letters look like their Latin counterparts, and most Greek letters resemble their Cyrillic counterparts. With a bit of study it's not too hard to decipher written names. You'll find that place names on road signs throughout the country are often transliterated into Latin letters (some signs, especially on the newer roads, are even outright translated into English).\nAs true throughout Greece, you will find multiple spellings for the same place because of the transliteration from the Greek to Roman alphabet and because Greek grammar rules change the word's spelling depending on whether it is the subject or object of a verb, or to indicate possession (each of these also change the pronunciation), and because of the language reform in 1976. You will see road sign and place names on maps that spell the same place different ways. Sometimes a place will be spelled how it is pronounced, sometimes it will be spelled using Roman letter substitutions. So you will see Heraklion, Iraklion, Heraklio and Iraklio for \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf and Rethymnon, Rethymno, Rethimnon and Rethimno for \u03a1\u03ad\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nEntry requirements\nGreece is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\nCitizens of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Seychelles are permitted to work in Greece without the need to obtain a visa or any further authorisation for the period of their 90 day visa-free stay. However, this ability to work visa-free does not necessarily extend to other Schengen countries.\nFor detailed regulations applied to your country, refer to the Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\n\nBy plane\n\n' Elefth\u00e9rios Veniz\u00e9los International Airport in Athens, is the country's largest, busiest airport and main hub, handling over 28 million passengers annually as of 2023, with flights from all over Europe, and the Middle East. Further destinations are China and Singapore. From April to October, American Airlines, Delta, United Airlines and Air Canada  operates flights from North America to Athens. Another airport which has international flights all year round is Macedonia Airport in Thessaloniki, that has flights all over Europe. \nTo the Greek islands such as Rhodes, Crete, Kos, Corfu, Santorini, Zakynthos, and Mykonos has flights from all over Europe during the summer season, mainly charter flights and low-cost flights, but also regular flights. When during the winter season, the only option to reach them is only by domestic flight.\n\n\nBy train\nAs of 2022, there are no long-distance international passenger services to Greece. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there used to be overnight trains from Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia to Thessaloniki. International trains might be resumed but there is no confirmation on when. An exception to this is that from November 2022 a regional service between Florina and Bitola in North Macedonia will commence.\nTravellers with an Interrail pass may obtain a discount on certain ferry crossings from Italy.\n\n\nBy car\nGreece can be entered by car from any of its land neighbours. From Italy, ferries will transport cars and passengers to Greece (see by boat section). From western Europe, the most popular route to Greece was through Yugoslavia. Following the troubles in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s, most motorists from western Europe came overland by Italy, and then took a trans-Adriatic ferry from there. Although the countries of the former Yugoslavia have since stabilized, and Hungary-Romania-Bulgaria form another, albeit a much longer, alternative, the overland route through Italy now remains the most popular option.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere is international bus service in Greece mostly from Thessaloniki, with some companies also having routes starting from Athens. All of the balkan countries (except Bosnia and Croatia) can be reached from the Greece, along with Turkey, Hungary and Germany.\n\n\nBy boat\nSee also: Ferries in the Mediterranean\nFrom Italy, main sea routes of the Adriatic connect the ports of Venice, Ancona, Bari and Brindisi of Italy to Patras and Igoumenitsa in mainland Greece. Several ferries also connect Italy to the Ionian Islands, though mostly during summer months. Trip duration varies from a minimum of about 8 hours Brindisi to Igoumenitsa, to a maximum 26 hours from Venice to Patras. Multiple ferries depart for Greece daily.\nFrom Turkey there are ferries from Marmaris to Rhodes, from \u00c7e\u015fme (near Izmir) to Chios, from Bodrum to Kos, from Kusadasi to Samos.\nFrom July 2019 a ferry sails overnight between Lavrio near Athens and \u00c7e\u015fme in Turkey, operated by Aegean Seaways .\nThere are also ferries connecting Piraeus (Athens) and Rhodes to Alexandria (Egypt), Larnaca and Limassol (Cyprus), and Haifa (Israel).\nWhen travelling with your own boat, Greece can be a quite difficult country to visit.  The free movement spirit of Schengen and EU seems to be very broken when arriving to Greece, even from another Schengen country, at least if your boat flies a non-EU flag (even that of a Schengen member):\n\nIt's needed to pay a special boating tax (TEPAI). It should be paid the latest on the day of arrival to Greek waters.  The fine for not having paid the TEPAI tax is quite high. The TEPAI can be paid online. This fee should be paid for each calendar month one stays in Greece, so be careful not to arrive at the very end of a month.\nA boat with an EU-flag may need documentation that VAT is paid.  As Polish flag-of-convenience has become common in the Mediterranean sea, boats with Polish flag will frequently be asked to produce such documentation.\nIf the boat has an EU flag and is sailed directly from a Schengen country it's not needed with any check-in, but it's mandatory to have an updated crew list on board at all times.\nIt's mandatory to have a good liability insurance, and some officials will demand that they explicitly states that the coverage is in accordance with Greek laws.  Most insurance companies in Greece will only offer insurance for residents of Greece, so if you can't obtain insurance explicitly valid for Greece in your home country, you may end up stuck at some port, not being allowed to leave - even with insurance documents that already was approved in several harbours.  Worse yet, in some ports you risk a big fine if you cannot prove you already had the insurance in order on the day of arrival to Greece.  The insurance company Interlife offers insurance for non-residents, send an email to info@interlife.gr.  While they are able to issue insurances reasonably fast, it's advisable to start the process a week before arriving to Greece to be sure to have this in order.\nBoats with flag from outside the EU needs to check-in in a valid port of entry, visit the customs office, and buy a transit log and has it stamped by the port police in every harbour visited(!), both on entry and departure.  In some curstom offices they may demand that you interface with them through an agent.\nAt the plus side, most officials have a pretty laid-back attitude, many harbours are for free or costs 10-15 EUR for a night even for a relatively big boat, particularly outside the season it can be easy and cheap to stay in a harbour.\n\n\nGet around\n\nA frequently asked question of travellers in Greece is whether they should rent a car. The primary advantage of having a car is that you can cover a lot more ground per day if you're travelling in rural areas or on the larger islands: you can get almost anywhere in Greece by bus, but some isolated villages may only have one or two buses per day, and having your own car means you don't have to wait in the summer heat for the bus to come. Almost all archaeological sites are accessible by bus, but at some of the more remote, less famous, sites, the bus may drop you off up to a mile away from the site, while with a car you can almost always get right to the site via at least a rough road.\nOn the other hand, going car-free in Greece is not only possible, but offers significant advantages, while driving involves a number of disadvantages. Though many people find driving in Greece easy and even pleasant, others are concerned by the high accident rate (one of the highest in Europe), the national reputation for risky driving, and the presence of many twisty mountainous roads, sometimes hugging the side of a cliff. Gas is as expensive as anywhere. (For more on driving conditions in Greece see below.) Driving in Athens and other big cities can be a frustrating, and sometimes hair-raising, experience, and finding parking can be very difficult. And having a car greatly restricts your flexibility when island-hopping, since only the larger, and usually slower, ferries offer car transport, which must be paid for in addition to your passenger ticket. Travelling by bus is not only cheaper but offers a greater chance of striking up conversations with both locals and other travellers than going by car. Language is not usually a problem for English speakers in using public transit: wherever there is significant tourism in Greece bus schedules are posted in English, and bus drivers and conductors, as well as taxi drivers, will understand at least enough English to answer your questions\nPublic transport can be supplemented by taxis (see below), which in many places, especially the islands, offer fixed rates to various beaches, which can be affordable especially if the price is shared among several people. And on many islands it's possible to get places by walking, which can be a pleasant experience in itself.\n\n\nBy bus\nIntercity buses are a very popular option for domestic travel. KTEL is the national government-subsidized network of independent businesses which cooperate together to form a dense route system serving almost the entire country. The system is efficient, reliable, and relatively inexpensive. It serves both long and short distances, including routes from major cities to islands near the mainland, such as Corfu and Cephalonia (in such cases, the ferry crossing is included in the price of the bus ticket).\nAs KTEL companies operate independently, the quality of information available online greatly varies between each one. Most companies now support online booking, at least for routes between major cities.\n\n\nBy train\nThe railway system in Greece is very underdeveloped compared to other European countries and most of the rail traffic is in the Athens - Thessaloniki corridor and in the suburban railways of these cities. The three other lines (Thessaloniki - Florina, Lamia - Trikala and Thessaloniki - Serres) usually have one or two trains running per day and are non-electrified with low speeds, so it is usually better to take a bus than a train. There are however multiple projects underway to greatly improve the country's railways scheduled to complete in phases from 2025 to 2027. Tickets can be booked via the Hellenic Train website.\n\n\nBy car\nExploring the country by car can be an extremely rewarding experience, allowing you to explore the incredibly scenic and varied terrain of the country's coastlines, interior, and islands, at your convenience. Roads are usually well-marked and well-maintained, and billions of euros are being poured into expanding the nation's network of multi-lane freeways. Because of the rapid expansion and improvement of the nation's road system, it is advised to have the most updated road maps possible. Many of the newer motorways are toll roads, and fees can be expensive. Road signs in Greek are usually repeated with a transliterated version in the Latin alphabet.\nDrivers who do not hold an EU driving licence must carry an international driver's permit obtained in their home country. This may not be required when renting a car, but will certainly be required if the driver is involved in an accident or pulled over by the police for a traffic citation. Insurance policies may be void if the driver is a non-EU driver without an international permit.\nPetrol prices are steep, but relatively inexpensive in comparison with many other EU countries.\nFor those used to driving in North America, driving in Greece can be a challenge. To them Greek (and other European) drivers might appear aggressive. Also the nation's topographic reality poses challenges by forcing many narrow roads in mountainous regions to take several twists and turns. Roads in towns and villages can be surprisingly narrow as well. If cars meet on a narrow stretch of road it is customary for one driver to find a spot to pull over and let the other driver pass. At times, one driver will need to back up for the other. Adherence to this practice is expected and failure to do so will bring the ire of your fellow drivers. Drive slowly through villages and small towns, because there are often pedestrians in the roadway. Another major difference between driving in North America and Greece is the range of speeds at which vehicles travel, particularly on the highways. While speed limits are as high as 120 km/h (75 mph), some vehicles will be travelling as slowly as 60 km/h (40 mph). Other vehicles will travel at speeds well in excess of the posted limits and can come up from behind very quickly.\n\n\nBy rental car\nCar rental offices are present throughout Greece, especially in major cities and in highly touristed areas. About 90% of rental cars are manual, for automatics it is advised to reserve one in advance. Some companies use vehicle classification scale from A to Z instead of the four-letter SIPP/ACRISS codes. Often rental terms restrict taking the vehicle on ferries.\nLarger car rental companies in addition to well known names like Avis/Budget, Europcar, Hertz/Firefly, Enterprise and SixT include Abbycar, AutoUnion, Kosmo Car Rental and Caldera. \nCheaper companies such as Greennmotion achieve lower cost by not having a real rental desk at airport, lesser trained and knowledgeable staff, instead having sign-and-greet, then a shuttle bus to bring customers to their \"airport office\" which is some distance away, so their lower prices are not without drawbacks. And online reviews have noted some companies' propensity to deceive customers through bait and switch, hidden and/or inflated charges. \nShoulder season starts from June 1, peaking at July. The rental companies' ratings on broker sites such as Rentalcars.com, Autoeurope.com are not necessarily indicative of their quality of service. \nSo beware of unreasonable rental conditions and unscrupulous agencies trying to attribute existing damages to new renters and inflating repair costs, make sure to do your due diligence, read terms and conditions and inspect the cars very carefully and note down the smallest irregularities before signing, as it is in their interest to not fully inform you of hidden damages.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nThe frequency, reliability and availability of Greek ferries are largely dependent upon the time of year. For instance, during the winter off-season (January to March), the weather on the Aegean can be extremely rough and boats are often kept in port for days at a time. This type of delay is extremely unpredictable (it is not a decision of the ferry companies, but rather, that of the port authority) and determining when a boat in harbour will actually set sail is near impossible. Therefore, travellers in off-season should build some flexibility into their schedule and not plan on departing an island in the morning and catching a flight home in the afternoon. On the opposite end of the spectrum, ferries in August fill up due to the National Holiday (15 Aug), so travellers should plan ahead. \nAs for routes, during high-season there are extensive connections from Athens and quite a few in-between islands for \"hopping.\" Again, in the winter, some of these ferries run once, maybe twice a week.\nVisitors to Greece planning to travel by ferry should be aware of some potential complications. First, it can't be assumed that you can get from any given island to any other island every day of the week. The Greek ferry system is basically a hub-and-spoke system, with the spokes radiating from Piraeus out to the various island groups. As a result, boats within the groups are fairly frequent, but less so between the groups. Sometime islands which are geographically close together are in different groups: for instance, the Western Cyclades (Serifos, Sifnos, Milos) look very close on a map to the Central Cyclades (Naxos, Paros, Mykonos,) but these groups are on different spokes, meaning you can usually in summer get from one island to another in the same group on any day, but boats between the groups, e.g. Naxos to Sifnos, may be significantly less frequent. Second, trying to find advance information on ferry schedules can be frustrating: there is no single comprehensive source for Greek ferry schedules either in print or on line, though there are private sites run by travel agents or other businesses which claim to give comprehensive schedules, and many of the individual ferry companies have web sites giving their schedules, in some cases offering the ability to book and pay for tickets on line. Ferry schedules are also always posted at the boat ticket offices in departure ports. Next, though getting a ticket usually isn't a problem, some boats to the most popular destinations, especially those leaving at the most convenient times, do sell out in high season or on holiday weekends. Finally, though ferries nowadays usually run on schedule, weather, strikes, and mechanical breakdowns still can occasionally delay them. None of these problems are insuperable, but they do mean you shouldn't try to micromanage your ferry itinerary too strictly in advance: be flexible, and always have a backup plan. And it's always a good idea not to count on taking a ferry from the islands to get back to Athens the same day your plane leaves, even if boat schedules theoretically should enable you to do this: this will probably work, but there's enough of a chance it won't to make it prudent to plan on getting back to Athens at least one day before your flight.\nThere are three ports in Athens: the main port Piraeus and outlying Rafina and Lavrio port. These serve all islands, but central Cyclades islands such as Tinos and Mykonos, it is often better to leave from Rafina.\nFerries are about the one thing in Greece that leave on time so be prompt. New \"fast ferries\" are cutting distance times in half but prices are slightly more expensive. Sometimes, it is more practical to fly, especially to Crete or Rhodes. However, flights are usually more expensive. Santorini is 8-hour slow boat from Athens but the entrance view from the boat is spectacular.\nThe major ferry companies operating in Greece include:\n\nAegean Speed Lines  (Cyclades)\nANEK Lines (Crete and international)\nBlue Star Ferries (Italy-Greece and Aegean Islands and Crete)\nHellenic Seaways (Cyclades, Argosaronic, North Aegean, Sporades)\nANES Ferries (Saronic, Sporades, Rodos Symi Line)\nSaronic Ferries (Saronic Gulf)\nSeajets (Aegean Islands)\nMinoan Lines (Italy-Greece and Crete)\nSAOS Ferries (Aegean Islands and northern mailand)\nSuperfast Ferries (Italy-Greece)\nVentouris Ferries (Italy-Greece)\nZante Ferries (Cyclades)\nGolden star Ferries (Cyclades, Sporades)\nLevante Ferries (Ionian Islands)\nKefalonian Lines (Ionian Islands)\nSchedules and web sites for some very local ferry services may be found on the destination pages for the relevant islands or ports, or you can also decide to rent a sailing boat, motor boat, catamaran or a gulet and explore Greece from a deep blue sea.\n\n\nBy plane\nDue to the limited train routes and lengthy travel times using the bus or ferries, flying is worth a consideration for travel between the mainland and the islands, as well as the far reaching major destinations at or near the mainland such as Corfu, Thessaloniki, Kalamata, Patras, and Kavala. In fact, should you book your tickets far in advance, these can cost similar to or even cheaper than the ferries! Most of Greece are reachable within an hour's flight from Athens or Thessaloniki. \nThe nation's domestic air travel industry is dominated by Olympic Air, Sky Express, Aegean Airlines and low-cost carrier Ryanair. These airlines offer an extensive route network within the country, including services connecting several islands and the mainland.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nMost commonly used are Uber and Bolt. \n\n\nBy taxi\nThere are many taxis in Greece. Over ten years ago, getting one could be quite a challenge, but not any more. You hail taxis on the street like in any other large city.\nTransport from the airport to the center of Athens is fixed cost from the taxi line that is outside exit 3 in the arrivals level.\nDay time fare from 05:00\u201300:00 cost \u20ac38\nNight time fare from 00:00\u201305:00 cost \u20ac54\nIf you need a taxi from the ferry at night from Piraeus, it might not be easy. The drivers who wait outside sometimes are looking to take at least three different individuals going in the same direction so they can charge three fares! If you are two or three people, only one person should hail the cab and then if the driver agrees to take you, have the other(s) jump in. In Greece you don't pay \"per capita\", unless of course the other passengers are strangers to you and you just happened to stop the same taxi. In this case you pay separately -for example you, your wife and you pay one fare, and the others pay also one fare (one fare for each \"group\", no matter how many there are in the same company). If you are 4 friends, you pay one fare.\nThe taxi situation has improved since the debt crisis in Greece, but being a tourist might make you vulnerable to \"extra\" charges (see also the section about the cost of living).\n\n\nBy boat\nMany major cruise ships visit the islands and there is also the option of hiring your own boat from any main harbour such as Athens, Kos and Lefkas.\nFor those sailors with experience, the Greek Islands provide an idyllic sailing experience with mostly moderate winds and calm waters. An exceptional sailing opportunity with a chance to visit many places in one go.  Be aware of the \"Meltemi\" phenomena though, strong winds coming with little warning.\nThere are several yacht charter companies where one can rent a boat skippered or not.\n\n\nSee\nFew countries can pride themselves on a heritage as important to Western civilization as Greece. A range of first class historic landmarks remind one of the days when the great Greek emperors and writers made their mark on the development of science, literature and democracy. No less than 17 of those monuments are listed as World Heritage Sites. However, the many charming little islands, sandy beaches and picturesque whitewashed coastal towns are at least as much a reason to come for the millions of tourists that this Mediterranean country receives each year.\nApart from that Greece offers a distinct and wonderful flora and fauna, with the odd tortoise appearing on the side of the road more often than you would expect.\n\n\nCultural heritage\n\nSo the famous Greek playwright takes his toga for repair, and the tailor recognises him - \"Euripides?\"\n\"Yes\" he says, \"Eumenides?\"\nWorld famous are the iconic Parthenon in the bustling capital Athens and the splendid site of Delphi, where the mighty emperors sought the prophecies of the most prominent oracle in the ancient Greek world. There's the temple of Apollo at Bassae and the gorgeous old city of Rhodes, once overlooked by the Colossus of Rhodes. The archaeological site of Olympia is the birthplace of our modern Olympic Games and the place from where the Olympic flame is sent around the world. The many Eastern Orthodox monasteries of Meteora are just stunning to look at, built high on natural sandstone rock pillars. At the small town of Vergina the ancient site of Aigai was found, and many valuable artifacts were discovered in several untouched tombs, one of them being the tomb of Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great. Proudly situated on Mt. Taygetos is the ancient town of Mystras, close to (and often mistaken for) ancient Sparta. Another great site is the island of Delos, not far from the popular holiday destination Mykonos. According to myths, this is where Apollo and Artemis were born. The island used to be the main Panhellenic sanctuary and is now dotted with archaeological remains.\nSome major sights are nicely located on one of the beautiful Greek islands, allowing for a delightful combination of sightseeing and relaxing on one of the many fine beaches. Patmos is a lovely example, boasting the historic centre Chora, the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian and the Cave of the Apocalypse, but also some pleasant sea side restaurants with pretty views. Corfu has the same characteristics, being a popular holiday destination with good beaches and an impressive historic town centre. The beach towns of Samos, just a stone's throw away from the Turkish mainland, are a good place to try the islands local wines (famous in the ancient world!). On the island are also the World Heritage Temple of Hera, the remains of the fortified port of Pythagoreion and the famous Tunnel of Eupalinos, a 1 km long subterranean aqueduct built in the 6th century BC. Although not an island, the ancient Mount Athos is in the north of Greece, on the peninsula of Chalkidiki. It's one of the country's most popular tourist regions with excellent beaches, numerous other ancient sites and many charming villages.\nIf you still want more of the historic stuff, admire the massive Sanctuary of Asklepios at Epidaurus or the Archaeological Sites of Mycenae and Tiryns. The Monasteries of Daphni (Athens), Hosios Loukas (Beotia) and Nea Moni (on the island of Chios) complete the World Heritage listings for Greece.\n\n\nIslands\nMain article: Greek Islands\n\nWhen it comes to Greece's famously gorgeous islands, it's hard to take your pick out of the 6000 options you have, 227 of them being inhabited. Their rocky coast lines, sandy beaches, charming villages, sheltered bays and many yacht harbours make them extremely popular among all kinds of travellers. The large island of Crete is a highly popular tourist destination, with landscapes varying from great sandy palm beaches to snow-covered high peaks and stunning river gorges and a good deal of night life in its main tourist towns. If you're looking to party at night, lovely Mykonos or Ios are good options too. The volcanic island of Santorini is one of the most romantic picks and offers some spectacular views. Its whitewashed capital of Fira is dramatically situated on the edge of a 400m high cliff, overlooking a beautiful blue lagoon. Other popular ones are Lesbos, Paros, Lefkada and Kos. The National Marine Park on Zakynthos is the primary nesting ground for loggerhead sea turtles in the Mediterranean. The rugged, green hills and valleys of Kefalonia boast a number of vineyards, and the island's cliffs and beautiful beaches make it a tourist hotspot. For a slightly more authentic and less touristy experience, try Syros, Amorgos or any of the other small and less developed islands. But if you want to live the way of life in Cyclades, Andros is one of the most original places to visit.\n\n\nSeaside resorts\nGreece measures 16,000 kms of its coastline within the waters of the Mediterranean basin. Its seaside resorts include coastal scenery, sandy beaches and a variety of stone-built villages.\n\n\nDo\nGreece offers not only well-known beach and water sports activities but also highly rewarding hiking areas and opportunities for religious and archaeological tourism.\nBeaches: In addition to the numerous islands, particularly Crete, Rhodes, Corfu, and Kos, the most famous mainland beaches can be found in Chalkidiki, Epirus, and the Peloponnese. For nude beaches in Greece, see here. The most popular islands for naturist (nudist) beaches include Crete, Zakynthos, Rhodes, Gavdos, and Antiparos.\nArchaeological Tourism: The most renowned archaeological sites are located in Attica (Athens), the Peloponnese, and the islands of Samos, Delos, and Crete.\nReligious Tourism: The centers of religious tourism are Mount Athos and the sites that the Apostle Paul visited during his travels, especially Philippi. The Via Egnatia in northern Greece is part of the pilgrimage route to Jerusalem.\nHiking: The most popular hiking areas are Mount Olympus, the gorges in Crete, the national parks in Epirus, and the less-known Rhodope Mountains.\nSailing: With its more than 1400 islands, Greece is one of the most attractive sailing destinations in the world. You can find countless secluded coves, cozy fishing villages with small ports, or lively promenades in larger harbor towns for evening entertainment, shopping, or making necessary repairs. There are marinas and berths along the coasts, which are still relatively inexpensive compared to France, Italy, or Croatia. While there are only a few marinas, there are small town harbors on the islands that often charge very reasonable fees. However, they do not offer services like showers, toilets, or washing machines. Water and fuel are available in most harbors, but you have to take care of it yourself by inquiring around the harbor. Power connections are almost never available in the small harbors. The harbors are usually situated in the town centers, allowing you to stroll through the streets in the evening or enjoy Greek specialties in local restaurants. The most popular sailing areas in Greece include the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, the Saronic Gulf Islands, the Dodecanese, and the Sporades. The North Aegean Islands are less known, but the distances between islands are greater, which means fewer boats are typically present, making it easier to find anchorages. The Ionian Islands are ideal for novice sailors due to mild winds and short distances. The best times for sailing in the Aegean are spring and autumn, as July and August can bring strong Meltemi winds, reaching up to 8 Beauforts, which are more suitable for experienced skippers.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nGreece uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\nThe euro replaced the drachma in January 2002.\n\n\nATMs\nATMs are present almost everywhere, with MasterCard/Cirrus and Visa/Plus being the most widely accepted cards. Many ATM machines may not accept 5-digit pin numbers; ATM card-users with 5-digit pins are advised to change their pin to 4 digits before leaving home.\nATMs usually charge \u20ac2.50\u20133 in addition to what your bank demands. This is added to the withdrawn amount and invoiced to your bank, but not dispensed. Thus, the larger the amount withdrawn, the less the fee percentage-wise.\n\n\nCards\nYou may get better exchange rates by using credit or debit cards directly, instead of exchanging cash. MasterCard, Visa, Maestro and Eurocard are widely accepted across the country in retail stores, hotels, and travel/transportation agencies (including ferry, airline, and car rental agencies), but are not accepted in some restaurants. Local souvenir shops usually require a minimum purchase before allowing you to use your card and may not accept it for special sales or deeply discounted items.\n\n\nMoney exchange\nCommon particularly in larger cities and in any touristed area. In addition to hard currency, they also accept traveller's cheques. There are also automated currency exchange machines in some areas of the country, particularly in Athens airport. Most banks will also exchange euros for some currencies\u2014such as US dollars and UK pounds \u2014often at better rates than currency exchanges. Banks' commission fees for these exchanges are usually structured so that it's more economical to change larger sums than smaller. Usually, only the larger, international-standard hotels will exchange money for their guests.\nBranches of the Greek bank Alphabank will exchange Euro American Express Travellers Cheques and US$ American Express Travellers Cheques into euros at their usual bank rates without fee or commission.\nWhen changing money in large amounts at a bank or currency exchange, it's a good idea to ask for mostly smaller notes, and nothing larger than a \u20ac50. Many businesses are reluctant to accept notes of larger than \u20ac50, partly because of a scarcity of change, partly because larger notes have a history of being counterfeited.\n\n\nShopping\n\n\nArts and crafts\nArtisan craftsmanship has a millennia-old tradition, but it is advisable to leave the beaten track and drive especially in the islands a few kilometres into the interior to get good goods at good prices.\n\n\nBargaining\nOne can bargain on many things, especially on clothing, souvenirs etc. You can also try different spots for what you are interested in buying and see the different prices that the specific item is sold, and pick the cheapest.\n\n\nBusiness hours\nGreece is in the Eurozone. Outside the tourist resorts and apart from the large supermarkets, a long lunch break is usually from about 14:00 to 17:00. Then the shops open again until 20:00 and sometimes even longer.\n\n\nCosts\nPrices are relatively high, especially on islands. Petrol cost \u20ac1.8-2.1/litre as of May 2023. A packet of cigarettes about \u20ac4-5. A loaf of bread cost about \u20ac1. A coffee in a bar \u20ac3-5, a bottle of beer in a small bar about \u20ac4-5, a shot of spirits about \u20ac4-8. You can buy much cheaper water, cheese, milk, ham, fruits, soaps, health care products, et al. in a supermarket such as Lidl, but bread is cheaper in bakeries.\nPublic transport ticket is \u20ac1.20 for a ticket that's valid for 90 minutes irrespective of number of transfers in the metro area and \u20ac5 or more for destinations out of Athens (for distances greater than 20-30 km). The buses and trains in the cities stop at night; then you need a taxi, ride hailing apps are Beat and TAXI 18300. The minimum charge was \u20ac3 and \u20ac0.80/km, double at night and also double when your destination is outside the city limits. Since June 2022 Beat also adds an additional \u20ac1.2 charge for calling a taxi through the app. There is an extra charge of \u20ac3 if you get a taxi from the airport -ask to see the official card with the specific costs for baggages etc. that all the taxis must have. \nYou can eat cheap if you eat \"souvlaki\" (pork or chicken pieces) for \u20ac2 each stick but usually one person needs two of them. Tavernas are much cheaper than restaurants to get lunch or dinner -you can eat in a taverna spending \u20ac12-20 per person. The main dish usually costs \u20ac7-12, the salad \u20ac7, the coke \u20ac2, the \"cover charge\" depending on the area. Tipping is usually an extra 10%, but if you get a \u20ac3 coffee in a bar, you shouldn't leave 0.20 because it will be considered an insult. Greeks in this case leave either nothing or at least 0.40-0.50 for a \u20ac2 charge.\nIf you need clothing, bath suit or shoes, bags, tea shirts etc., the cheapest shops (but by no means the best) are the Chinese which you can find almost in every block in the cities. An acceptable pair of shoes, about \u20ac40 (although there are shoes that cost \u20ac15 or \u20ac300), trousers \u20ac20-80. Hairdressers cost \u20ac8-40, usually around \u20ac20 if you want to leave satisfied.\nA ticket to a cinema costs around \u20ac8 per person, with \u20ac5-8 for a drink or snack in the intermission. Seashores are usually free but around Athens many of them charge \u20ac4-5 per person. Sometimes in free beaches you pay extra (if you want) in order to use the umbrella or other facilities.  \nIf you like Greece and decide to rent an apartment, don't say you are a tourist, because they will ask you for more - they'll think you don't know the prices. Find a Greek to trust and let them negotiate on your behalf. Greeks pay for two rooms \u20ac250-400 in middle class areas, up to \u20ac700 for expensive areas (rarely) or down to \u20ac180 (also rarely) in areas you don't really want to live in. \nElectricity costs about \u20ac60-100 a month. For a single person who doesn't work and keep the air conditioning or the heat all day long, and uses washing machine once a week, cooks every day and needs hot water on daily base, gets to pay \u20ac80-100 a month. Tap water is about \u20ac7-10 a month. Internet and phone at home costs about \u20ac25-40 a month. \nIf you cook at home, potatoes cost \u20ac1-2/kg, olive oil \u20ac4.5-6/litre, cooking oil for frying \u20ac4/litre, tomatoes \u20ac1-3 (depending on the season), meat \u20ac5-12/kg, fresh fishes \u20ac10-20/kg in the fish market (the frozen meats and fishes are much cheaper), and the fruits (also depending on the season) \u20ac1-5. (All prices in this section as of Feb 2019)\n\n\nKiosks\nThere are newsstands (per\u00edptero) in every corner of the city, where newspapers, magazines, chilled drinks, confectionery, snacks, tobacco and ice cream can all be bought.\n\n\nMarkets\nGreece farmers markets (Laik\u00ed Agor\u00e1) take place at least once a week in every town. Here agricultural products of the region but also the things of daily life are offered. They have a very special flair that you should not miss. Standowners in the big markets are vociferously promoting their products, while the small rural markets are comparatively quiet. One is rarely addressed by the sellers. But there are many other things to discover in the markets. For example olives. Stalls offer the wide selection of pickled olives. It\u2018s allowed to taste before you buy what you like most. Also very nice are the stalls that offer nuts. A very wide selection of nibbles, you can buy here. Again, tasting is allowed. Of course, there is also a part that offers clothes, shoes, fabrics and jewellery. Here you get the known plagiarism, but also products from Greece.\nSupermarket chains are Skvalenitis, Masoutis, AB Vasilopoulos, Market In and Economy Market, smaller mini marts include OK Market.\n\n\nTipping\nTraditionally tipping in restaurants is not customary in Greece. Rounding of the bill used to work both ways, up or down to the nearest note amount. A tip was considered insulting, and the best way to show appreciation was to come back. In touristy areas this has almost completely vanished, but off the beaten track it is still alive.\nTipping is certainly not based on a predetermined percentage. Customers usually leave a tip on the table, varying from a few coins to large amounts of money, according to how satisfied they are by the service, but usually something like \u20ac1-2. Tipping taxi drivers is uncommon.\nMany restaurants bring you a bottle of water and charge you without your having ordered it. Thus, if you do not like this approach, kindly refuse the bottle of water if it is a fresh and newly opened one. Tap water is generally free.\n\n\nVAT\nValue Added Tax is charged on most items, usually included in the item's price but some shops offer \"Tax Free\" shopping to non-EU residents. This means that non-EU residents can ask for a VAT refund at their port of exit in the EU. Ask for your voucher before leaving the shop and show that along with your items to the customs officer upon departure from the EU.\n\n\nIn general\nThings you might buy at home but are (usually) fresh in Greece include olive oil, fruits (watermelon, cantaloupe, peaches, grapes, strawberries, etc.), feta cheese, and some breads and sweets that are local (see the \"Eat\" section). As for drinks, \"Retsina\" and \"Tsipouro\" are also local, but the first has a peculiar taste and the second is really strong, like \"ouzo\" and \"raki\". Don't mix those four with other drinks if you buy some for back home. It's nice to buy small statues and miniatures of ancient Greek art, but search for the cheap ones in various shops - you can almost always find them in half the price. Shops that cater to tourists are always more expensive - a local you can trust could be of great use. Buy definitely a hat for the sun if it's summer and sunblock (see the \"Natural dangers\" section).\n\n\nEat\nSee also: Greek cuisine\n\nGreek cuisine is a blend of indigenous traditions and foreign influences. Neighbouring Italy and Turkey have left a major impact on Greek cuisine, and there are shared dishes with both of these nations. The traditional Greek diet is very Mediterranean, espousing vegetables, herbs, and grains native to the Mediterranean biome. Being a highly maritime nation, the Greeks incorporate plenty of seafood into their diet. Greece is also a major producer and consumer of lamb; beef, pork, and especially chicken are also popular. Olive oil is a staple in Greek cooking, and lemon and tomatoes are common ingredients. Bread and wine are always served at the dinner table.\nThe cuisine in Greece can be radically different from what is offered in Greek restaurants around the world. Greek restaurants abroad tend to cater more to customer expectations rather than offer a truly authentic Greek dining experience. One example is the famous gyros (yee-ros), a common item on Greek menus outside Greece. While it is a popular fast-food item in Greece today, it is a foreign import adapted from the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebap after World War II. It is considered by Greeks as junk food. It is never served in the home and is generally not found on the menus of non-fast-food restaurants.\nGreeks live to eat, and eating out is Greece's national pastime and a rewarding experience for visitors; however, not knowing where to go or what to do can dampen the experience. In the past, restaurants that catered mostly to tourists were generally disappointing. Thankfully, the nation's restaurant industry has grown in sophistication over the past decade, and it is now possible to find excellent restaurants in highly-touristed areas, particularly areas that are popular with Greek tourists as well. Thus, it remains a good idea to dine where Greeks dine (Go search them at the times Greeks dine: 21:00-23:00). The best restaurants will offer not only authentic traditional Greek cuisine (along with regional specialities) but Greece's latest culinary trends as well.\nA good sign of authenticity is when you get a small free dessert when you ask for the bill. Bad signs are when desserts are listed on the menu, large posters depicting food are seen outside or when a waiter is standing outside yelling for clients to come in or taking your plates away while you are still sitting at the table (traditionally everything is left on the table until the customer is gone, even if there is hardly any space left).\nRestaurants serving international cuisine have also made a presence in the country, offering various options such as Chinese, French, Italian, and international contemporary.\n\n\nVegan and vegetarian\nRestaurants catering strictly to vegans and vegetarians are practically non-existent outside of Athens. However, there are many vegan and vegetarian dishes in Greek cuisine. As a vegan, you'll probably end up ordering fava every time you go to a taverna but do ask the waiter if there are other vegan dishes on the menu or if the chef could make a vegan-friendly version of a particular dish. In cases when someone is not familiar with the concept of veganism, you may ask if the food you're ordering is \u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf (nistisimo), i.e. appropriate for people who fast for religious reasons. Such food may still contain honey or even seafood, so make sure to ask.\nA number of vegan restaurants have opened in and around Athens. Falafel places are also becoming quite popular. There are also many shops with healthy food and a vegan shop, all in addition to ubiquitous fruit and veg shops.\nBut also do not miss the numerous stalls on the side of the road selling delicious local fruits, vegetables and produces.\n\n\nPopular local dishes\n\nThe traditional fast foods are gyros (\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \"GHEER-ohs\", not \"GY-rohs\" as in \"gyroscope\"), roast pork or chicken (and rarely beef) and fixings wrapped in a fried pita; souvlaki (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9, \"soov-LAH-kee\"), grilled meat on a skewer; Greek dips such as tzatziki (\u03c4\u03b6\u03b1\u03c4\u03b6\u03af\u03ba\u03b9), made of strained yoghurt, olive oil, garlic and finely chopped cucumbers and dill or mint; and skordhalia (\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac), a garlic mashed potato dip which is usually served with deep fried salted cod.\nWith its extensive coastline and islands, Greece has excellent seafood. Try the grilled octopus and the achinosalata (sea-urchin eggs in lemon and olive oil). By law, frozen seafood must be marked as such on the menu. Fresh fish, sold by the kilogram, can be very expensive; if you're watching your budget, be sure to ask how much your particular portion will cost before ordering it.\nGreek salad (called \"country salad\" locally, \"horiatiki\"), a mix of tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese and onion \u2013 all sliced \u2013 plus some olives, and occasionally green bell pepper or other vegetables, usually garnished with oregano. Traditionally it is dressed only with olive oil; vinaigrette or lettuce are added only in the most tourist-oriented restaurants. It is the typical summer salad.\n\nAlso consider:\n\nmoussaka, a rich oven-baked dish of eggplant, minced meat, tomato and white sauce\npastitsio, a variety of lasagna\nstifado, pieces of meat and onion in a wine and cinnamon stew\nspetzofai, braised sausage with pepper and tomatoes, a hearty dish from the Mt. Pelion region\nsahanaki, fried semi-hard cheese\npaidakia, grilled lamb chops, are also popular. (They tend to have a gamier taste and chewier texture than North American lamb chops, which you may or may not like.)\ncreamy peppered cheese, eggplant salad or fried zucchini\nfasolada, dry beans stew, sometimes considered Greece's national dish. A variety with a larger bean cultivar is known as \"Gigantes\".\nFried potatoes (often listed on menus as chips) are a naturalized Greek dish, found almost everywhere. They can be very good when freshly made and served still hot. Tzatziki is usually a good dip for them, though they are still good on their own.\nFor dessert, ask for baklava, tissue-thin layers of pastry with honey, cinnamon and chopped walnuts; or galaktoboureko, a custard pie similar to mille feuille. Other pastries are also worth tasting. Another must-try is yoghurt with honey: yoghurts in Greece are really different from what you used to see at Danone stores: to start with, genuine yoghurt in Greece has 10% of fat. Fruit such as watermelon is also a common summertime treat.\nFor breakfast, head to local bakeries (fourno) and try fresh tiropita, cheese pie; spanakopita, spinach pie; or bougatsa, custard filled pie, or even a \"\"horiatiko psomi\", a traditional, crusty village type bread that is a household staple, and very tasty on its own too.  All are delicious and popular among Greeks for quick breakfast eats. Each bakery does own rendition and you are never disappointed. Go to the next Kafeneion with them and have it there with a Greek coffee to be local.\nA popular drink is a frappe made with instant Nescaf\u00e9, water, sugar, and sometimes milk. It is frothed and served over ice.\n\n\nCover fee\nIt's common to charge a cover fee in restaurants officially (i.e. stating it in a receipt), such as \u20ac0.30 to \u20ac2 per person, but if it's tending towards \u20ac2 you should really consider eating somewhere else.\n\n\nFast food\nMcDonald's and Domino's pizza have made a significant presence in Greece over the past 15 years. However, they face strong competition from the popular local chains and they are not really popular with natives, especially outside Athens.\nGoody's is the most popular fast-food chain in the country, offering a large variety of fast food meals, with numerous outlets throughout the country. A hamburger with Coke costs \u20ac3-5. Everest is a chain which specialises in hand-held snacks. Also in Thessaloniki you can find Subito. Flocaf\u00e9 is gaining popularity through its coffee and dessert items. There are also many independently-owned fast food businesses that offer typical fast food items, such as gyros. Many of these small businesses tend to be open late at night, and are popular with younger crowds on their way home from a night out.\n\n\nDrink\nThose wishing to booze in Greece would be well advised to stick to the traditional domestic Greek products discussed below, which are freely available, mostly cheap by European standards, and usually of good quality. Any imported, non-Greek alcoholic beverages are likely to be very expensive if genuine and, if cheap, may well be \"bomba,\" a locally distilled alcohol with flavourings which sometimes, especially in island bars catering to young people, masquerade as whisky, gin, etc. If you drink it, you'll be very sorry. Drink in respectable places where you can see the bartender mix your drink.\n\n\nWater\nA glass of water is traditionally served with any drink you order; one glass for each drink, especially with any form of coffee. Sometimes you even get a glass of water first and then you are asked what you want to drink. Sometimes you might as well get a bottle instead of just a glass. In touristy areas you might have to ask for a glass of water if you want one. If you don't get water with a coffee you just stepped into a tourist-trap. Also, if you did not explicitly ask for a bottle instead of a glass, and they try to charge you for it you should refuse.\nTap water in most places a tourist would visit is drinkable; if in doubt, ask your hotel. But often though drinkable it doesn't taste very good, especially on some small islands (as it is imported in and heavily chlorinated), and many visitors, like many Greeks, prefer bottled water. By law, water prices in shops must remain within acceptable limits, making it much cheaper than in Anglosphere nations. A half litre of bottled water costs (July 2022) \u20ac0.50 if you buy it on the street, and \u20ac0.15 if you buy it from the supermarket.\n\n\nWines\nTo be able to purchase or drink alcohol in Greece, by law, you must be 17 and photographic ID will be asked for infrequently, especially in venues that sell food (many independent fast food outlets will serve alcohol).\nGreece, an ancient wine producing country, offers a wide variety of local wines, from indigenous and imported grape varieties, including fortified and even sparkling wines. Greek wines are generally not available on the international market, as production is relatively small, costs are quite high and little remains for export. However, in the past decade Greek wines have won many international prizes, with the rise of a new generation of wineries. Exports are rising as well.\nWine (Krasi: \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03af / oenos: \u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) is most Greeks' drink of choice.\nAlmost every taverna has \"barrel wine,\" usually local, which is usually of good quality and a bargain (\u20ac6-8/litre, but check this before ordering when you are in a touristy area.).\nIf they have it, try also the Imiglyko (Half-Sweet) red, even if sweet wine is usually not your preference, it is different from anything you know.\nRetsina is a \"resinated wine\" with a strong, distinctive taste that can take some getting used to; the flavour comes from pine resin, which was once employed as a sealant for wine flasks and bottles. The most well-known and cheap-n-dirty is \"Kourtaki Retsina\".\nBottled wines have gotten increasingly more expensive; some that the beginner may find worth trying are whites from Santorini and reds from Naoussa and Drama. All wines and alcoholic beverages are cheaper in the super markets, but then you can't consume them in a bar, unless you keep them hidden in small bottles and use them very discretely.\n\n\nBeer\nEven if beer (bira: \u03bc\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1) is consumed all around the country, don't come to Greece for the beer. The only local varieties widely available are Mythos and Alpha, but Greeks drink mostly Northern European beers produced under license in Greece like Heineken and Amstel. Heineken is affectionately known as \"green\"; order it by saying \"Mia Prasini.\"\nOn the quality front, there is also a microbrewery/restaurant called Craft (2 litre jug also available in large supermarkets), and new organic beer producers like Piraiki Zythopoiia.\n\n\nLiquor\n\nThe most famous indigenous Greek liquor is ouzo (\u03bf\u03cd\u03b6\u03bf), an anise-flavored strong spirit (37.5%), which is transparent by itself but turns milky white when mixed with water. Mainlanders do not drink ouzo with ice, but tourists and Greek islanders generally do. A 200 ml bottle can be under \u20ac2 in supermarkets and rarely goes above \u20ac8 even in expensive restaurants. Mytilene (Lesbos) is particularly famous for its ouzo. A few to try are \"Mini\" and \"Number 12,\" two of the most popular made in a middle-of-the-road style, \"Sans Rival,\" one of the most strongly anise-flavored ones, \"Arvanitis,\" much lighter, and the potent \"Barba Yianni\" and \"Aphrodite,\" more expensive and much appreciated by connoisseurs.\nRaki or tsikoudia is the Greek equivalent of the Italian grappa, produced by boiling the remains of the grapes after the wine has been squeezed off. It is quite strong (35-40% of alcohol) and in the summer months it is served cold. It costs very little when one buys it in supermarkets or village stores. The raki producing process has become a male event, as usually men are gathering to produce the raki and get drunk by constantly trying the raki as it comes out warm from the distillery. One raki distillery in working order is exhibited in Ippikos Omilos Irakleiou in Heraklion, but they can be found in most large villages. In northern Greece it is also called tsipouro (\u03c4\u03c3\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf). In Crete, raki is traditionally considered an after-dinner drink and is often served with fruit as dessert.\n\n\nCoffee\nCoffee (kafes: \u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c2) is an important part of Greek culture.\nThe country is littered with kafet\u00e9ries (kafet\u00e9ria singular) which are cafes that serve as popular hangouts for Greeks, especially among the under-35s. They tend to be pretty trendy -yet relaxed- and serve a variety of beverages from coffee, to wine, beer, spirits, as well as snacks, desserts, and ice cream. In the pleasant months of spring, summer, and fall, all kafet\u00e9ries provide outdoor tables/seating and they are busiest with customers in the late afternoon and evening hours. Several kafet\u00e9ries also double as bars.\nKafeneia (coffee houses) are ubiquitous, found even in the smallest village, where they traditionally served a function similar to that of the village pub in Ireland. Their clientele tends to be overwhelmingly men over 50, however everyone is welcome, male or female, young or old, Greek or foreigner; and you will be treated extremely courteously. However, if you're not interested in cultural immersion to this extent, you may find the kafeneia pretty boring.\nTraditionally, coffee is prepared with the grounds left in. It is actually a somewhat lighter version of Turkish coffee but in Greece it's only known as Greek coffee - \"ellinik\u00f3s kaf\u00e9s\" or simply \"ellinik\u00f3s.\" Despite being slightly lighter than the original Turkish coffee, it remains a thick, strong black coffee, served in a small cup either sweetened or unsweetened. If you don't specify, the coffee is usually served moderately sweet. Greek coffee traditionally was made by boiling the grounds and water on a stove in a special small pot called a \"briki.\" More and more now days it's made by simply shooting steam from an espresso machine into the water/coffee mixture in the briki, resulting in an inferior drink. If you find a place that still actually uses a stove burner to make their coffee, you can be sure it's a traditional cafe.\nDuring the hot summer months, one of the most popular coffees at the kafet\u00e9ries is frapp\u00e9 (\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad): shaken iced instant coffee. This is actually an original Greek coffee and can be really refreshing, ordered with or without milk, sweetened or unsweetened.\nCoffee can also be made espresso-style, French press (mainly at hotels), and with modern filter technology. The latter is sometimes known as \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2: gallikos (\"French\") which can lead to some confusion with the press method. It is best to ask for \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5: filtrou, which refers unambiguously to filter coffee. It is best not to ask for black coffee, as it is unlikely that anyone will understand what you are asking for.\nEspresso freddo or cappuccino freddo have gained much popularity the last decade, and these are the most popular coffees throughout Greece. Espresso freddo is simply espresso + ice; cappuccino freddo refers to espresso + ice + chill milk foam. They may be served from mousse containers, not prepared to order; be careful to check.\n\n\nIced tea\nIn mass-sector taverns and cafe, iced tea typically means instant; ask twice if you prefer brewed ice tea.\n\n\nSleep\nIf you enjoy the local traditions and charm, unhurried rhythm of living, small, family-run pensions are the best way to enrich your experience. Owners and personnel there are friendly and open-minded, compared to the impersonal service you normally encounter in large hotels.\nIf you have a bigger budget, renting a villa is a luxurious and splendid idea. They are normally near or on the beach and provide more space and a great view.\nIn Greece hotels, especially in the islands but also even in Athens and other big cities, tend to be simple establishments. Rooms are typically small, and bathrooms smaller, with the shower often a hand-held sprayer; if there is a bath-tub, it's often a sit-bath. Sometimes in the most basic places shower curtains are lacking. Closets are often inadequate, and sometimes there is only a wardrobe. On the plus side, such hotels typically have a balcony (though sometimes tiny) or veranda, either private or a large one shared by all the rooms (but these are usually spacious enough not to feel cramped.) Standards of cleanliness are usually good, even in the simpler places. Those who want more luxurious accommodation can usually find it in cities and on the more popular islands but should check the hotel's quality in reliable sources to be sure of what they're getting.\nMost Greek hotels now, even the smaller ones, have websites and will take bookings by email, though sometimes fax is a more reliable way to communicate. There are also numerous Greek and international hotel booking services which will make bookings, and sometimes these are cheaper, or have rooms available when the hotel itself says it's sold out. If you're not really particular about choosing a hotel, you can usually find a place on a walk-in basis without too much trouble on all but the most crowded islands, where rooms can be difficult to find at the peak of the season, and even in the shoulder season on weekends and major holidays. If you do get stuck for a room, try a local travel agency (preferably one endorsed by a reputable guidebook) or alternatively, ask at a cafe whether the owner knows of any rooms for rent; often they do.\nOn some islands, though this varies from place to place, the owners of accommodations will meet arriving ferries to offer rooms. Often they'll have a van there to transport you from the port, and will have brochures to show you. These places are perfectly legitimate, they're sometimes among the best value places. You can negotiate prices, especially when there are a lot of them trying to fill their rooms, and prices in the range of \u20ac20-25 for a room or even a studio is not uncommon in mid-season. But they could be anywhere from a few steps away from the port to a mile out of town, so before accepting such an offer it's best to be sure you get a good idea of its location.\nPlaces listed in the guide books tend to be booked up in advance and usually get more expensive as soon as they know they are in there!\n\nGreek rooms typically have air conditioning nowadays. If this is important to you, ask before booking. Some rooms in old traditional buildings with thick stone walls may not need it. Televisions are also common, though the picture may be too fuzzy to be much use, and if you get the set to work you may find it receives programs only in Greek. Room phones are rare in the less expensive places.\nThe main problem you're likely to encounter with a Greek hotel room is noise. Anything on a road is likely to suffer from traffic noise, and even at hotels not on a major road you may find that that \"footpath\" outside is used as a superhighway by Greece's notoriously loud motorbikes. And tavernas and clubs nearby can be loud. If you're concerned about noise, it makes sense to choose your hotel's location carefully. The quietest ones are likely to be in an old part of the town or village accessible only by stairs which counter the prevailing \"if I can drive it there I will drive it there\" car and motorbike philosophy.\nIn addition to hotels, almost every popular Greek destination offers self-catering accommodations called studios or sometimes apartments\u2014the terms are pretty much interchangeable. Often these are run by hotels: a hotel may include some self-catering units, or the managers of a hotel may also run a separate building of self-catering apartments. Though not listed very often in travel guides, these studios are most certainly a viable option for many travellers. Typically, a studio consists of one large room, usually larger than a hotel room (though sometimes there are multiple rooms,) with a sink, small refrigerator, and two-burner hot-plate. They usually have a private balcony or veranda, a television, and air conditioning, though rarely a room phone and almost never internet access. In contrast to a hotel, they lack a front desk, there is no breakfast or other food service, and there may be maid service only once every two or three days. Studios are often in quieter and more scenic locations than hotels. For those who don't require the full services of a hotel, studios can be an attractive alternative offering better accommodation for the money, and the chance to economize on food by preparing some meals yourself.\n\n\nLearn\nBeing the cradle of Western civilisation, Greeks take education very seriously. Many of the world's greatest minds (e.g. Aristotle, Pythagoras, Plato, Democritus) were from Greece, many Greeks have university degrees, and the country sends many students to universities all over the world. \nAlthough this all sounds impressive, Greece isn't a popular destination for foreign students yet. The Greek government is trying to change that, however. Greek universities charge low tuition fees for all students, including international students.\nThe Greek educational system is known for being notoriously difficult, competitive, and painstaking; Greek parents often complain that children get too much homework, and the national Panhellenic exams (known as Apolytirion and are akin to A-Levels in the United Kingdom) are widely criticised for being extremely difficult and gruelling. \nIf there's one thing that attracts students to Greece, it's the affordable cost of living. Costs in Greece are much lower compared to other European countries. Athens is remarkably cheaper to live in than say, Oslo in Norway.\nThe most prestigious univeristies in the country are as follows: The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, National Technical University of Athens, and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. \nStudents from EU countries may enter many sites for free. Students from other countries have their entrance fees reduced. So take your International Student Identity Card with you.\n\n\nModern Greek courses\nFor those interested in learning modern Greek, there are several schools offering courses in language instruction for foreigners. Most of these are designed for English speakers, but some schools have courses for people with other first languages. Some schools are in Athens, some in Thessaloniki (among them the very good school of Modern Greek language in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) while others have centers in the islands offering a residential program that combines language study with a vacation. Some offer individual tutoring in addition to classes. Some well established programs are The Hellenic Culture Centre (an associate of The Ikarian Centre,) and The Athens Centre.\n\n\nWork\nCitizens of European Union or EFTA member countries work in Greece without any restrictions, while citizens of non-EU/EFTA countries, including the United Kingdom, need a work permit to work in Greece.\nFinding a job in Greece can be a difficult endeavour. There are not enough jobs for people (the unemployment rate in Greece is quite high) and many Greeks have moved abroad for employment opportunities. \nDespite being a developed country, wages in Greece are rather low.\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nCrime and theft\nViolent crime and theft rates are low; public disorder is rare, and public drunkenness is generally frowned upon. Visitors should rest assured that this is a safe and friendly destination, but it is always advisable for foreign tourists to exercise basic precautionary measures just as they would at home. There has been a spike in theft (or at least a perceived one), which some locals will not hesitate to blame on the influx of immigrants.\nThe places where the visitor is most likely to encounter crime and theft are overcrowded and popular with tourists. This includes the metro in Athens and tourist resorts thronged with younger foreigners. The more notorious of such places include Faliraki in Rhodes (calmed down since a new tough mayor was elected), Kavos in Corfu, Malia on Crete, and Ios (though this last is said to have quieted down a bit.) Most visitors to these places return home safely, but there have been increasing reports from them of theft, public indecency, sexual assault, and alcohol-fueled violence; both the perpetrators and victims are usually young foreigners, though sometimes locals are involved. Authorities have stepped up the police presence in such areas to crack down on these activities. Still, visitors to these places would do well to avoid anything that looks like trouble, especially late at night, and to remember that their own overindulgence in alcohol increases their chance of attracting trouble themselves.\n\n\nScams\nThe most commonly reported major scam against travellers is the Greek version of the old clip joint routine. This is reported primarily from central Athens, but also occasionally from other cities and even the larger island towns. A single male traveller will be approached, usually at night in a neighborhood where there are a lot of bars, by a friendly Greek who will strike up a conversation leading to an invitation to go to \"this really cool bar I know\" for a drink. Once at the bar, they are joined by a couple of winsome ladies who immediately begin ordering drinks, often champagne, until, at the end of the evening, the mark is presented with an astronomical bill, payment of which is enforced by the sudden appearance of a pair of glowering thugs. The reason this scam works is because most Greeks have a tradition of being friendly to visitors, and almost all Greeks who strike up a conversation with you will have no ulterior motives. But if you're a single male traveller approached by a Greek in the circumstances described above, it's safest to politely but firmly decline any invitations.\nAlso don't accept to change your money on the street and if someone asks you if you could change a \u20ac20 or \u20ac50 note, refuse (you might get a counterfeit note).\n\n\nPhotography restrictions\nIt is strictly forbidden to take photos of military installations or other strategic locations. Authorities will take violations quite seriously. Obey signs prohibiting photography. In fact, it would be best not to take photographs of anything of military significance, including Greek navy ships, or of airports or any aircraft, even civilian ones: Greek authorities can be very sensitive about such things. Many museums prohibit photography without a permit; some prohibit only flash or tripod photography, and many ask visitors not to take photos of objects (statues, etc.) which include people standing by them, as this is considered disrespectful. Officials at museums will rush over to yell at you if they see a camera or even a cell phone in your hand.\n\n\nAntiquities\n\nGreece also has very strict laws concerning the export of antiquities, which can include not only ancient objects but also coins, icons, folk art, and random pieces of stone from archeological sites. Before buying anything which could conceivably be considered an antiquity, you should become familiar with the current laws regarding what can be taken out of the country. Briefly, all objects made before 1830 are considered antiquities and are protected by the Ministry. Do not ever think to export or buy any piece of archeological value because it will be either be a fake or you will be arrested promptly at the airport for trafficking of goods of archeological value.\n\n\nDrugs\nGreece has some of the strictest, and most strictly enforced, drug laws in Europe, and tourists are not exempt. No matter what anyone tells you, it is most definitely not cool to do drugs in Greece, including marijuana. Furthermore, such a behaviour is strongly rejected by most locals and will almost certainly cause someone to call the Police and have you arrested. Even a very small quantity is enough to get you in serious trouble. Don't even think of offering even the smallest amount of drug to someone else. You risk being prosecuted with charges of drug dealing, leading to several years of imprisonment!\n\n\nTraffic\nThe greatest danger to travellers in Greece is probably in the simple process of crossing the street: traffic can be bad even in smaller towns and horrendous in Athens and other Greek cities, and accident rates are high. Caution should be exercised by pedestrians, even when crossing with a walk light. Traffic fatalities were cut by 60% in the ten years leading up to 2018, but in that year 709 people were killed on Greek roads \u2014 64 per million people, which is higher than the average of 49 in the rest of the European Union. Drivers often weave between lanes while speeding. Stay safe.\n\n\nCope\nToilets in public spaces such as restaurants and bars sometimes lack seats over the porcelain, so to avoid direct contact with the toilet's porcelain, you may want to bring disposable toilet seat covers.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\n\nHealth care\nThe government's austerity program in the 2010s led to a \"meltdown\" of Greece's previously admired health care system, as the budgets of state-run hospitals have been cut by up to 50%. Many citizens prefer private health care for longer-term hospital stays. Hospitals face shortages of doctors, nurses and basic supplies. However, public health care is free and universal for all citizens, and for all EU nationals upon presentation of an EHIC card (formerly the E111 form). For non-EU nationals, only emergency care is provided for free.\nA network of helicopter ambulances serves the islands, transporting patients who need immediate attention to the nearest island or city with a major hospital.\nThe country's pharmacies and medications are of top quality, and pharmacists are highly trained experts in their field. Many medications that need a prescription in the UK and US can be purchased without a prescription in Greece. When sick with a simple, common illness, a visit to the pharmacist will provide you with the medication you need. If you are looking for a specific medication, be sure to know its generic name, as brand names might be different. Most pharmacies close on Sundays, but a sign will be posted on the door indicating the nearest pharmacies that are open.\nHealthcare provision is different to Anglosphere nations in that many specialists are in the community. GPs are replaced by community pathologists. Hotels and tourist agencies can provide advice on where to go if you are ill.\n\n\nSexually transmitted infections\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) exist in Greece as elsewhere, and travellers who may engage in sexual activity while visiting Greece should remember that even if one is on vacation and one's sexual partner is also a traveller, perhaps from one's own country, neither of these facts suspend the laws of biology. According to reports in the Greek and British media, unprotected sex among visitors to Greece, with a consequent rise in STIs and unplanned pregnancies, is especially common at the party resorts favoured by younger people, such as Ios, Malia, Kavos, and Faliraki. Condoms are available at any pharmacy and at many kiosks.\n\n\nNatural dangers\n\nSun and heat pose risks that summer visitors should take precautions for. Take a good, light sun hat and sun glasses, and drink plenty of water.\nIn late spring and summer, the government runs public service announcements on television reminding Greeks to wear their sunblock at the beach. The Mediterranean sun tends to get quite strong, and can burn skin that has not been exposed to the sun for a long time. Any excessive daily sun exposure can also cause long-term damage to skin. Sunblock and sunscreen are widely available throughout Greece at supermarkets, grocery stores, pharmacies, and special stores selling beach-related items, though they tend to be expensive, and the higher SPF factor blocks can be hard to find.\nDuring the hottest months, while visiting archaeological sites, wear tank tops, carry umbrellas, and carry water. Daily high temperatures stay at about 95-100\u00b0F (35-38\u00b0C). The sun is merciless. Athens has been subject to periodic summer heat waves where the temperature can reach above 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), posing a risk of respiratory problems and heat stroke for some people. Many islands, especially in the Cyclades, have very little shade to ameliorate the summer heat; if hiking around such islands, including going by foot to distant beaches, it's especially important in hot weather to wear a hat and sunscreen, to take water, and to avoid being caught walking during the hottest part of the day.\nJellyfish periodically infest some beaches and their stings can be severe. The red ones are particularly dangerous. Sea urchins are common along the Greek coast, usually clinging to underwater flat surfaces such as smooth rocks and sea walls. They usually inhabit shallow water so they're easy to see. Care should be taken not to step on them, since their spines can be painful.\nDon't hike cross country in Greece alone: even in popular places, the countryside can be surprisingly deserted, and if you get in trouble while you're out of sight of any houses or roads, it could be a long time before anyone notices you.\nLifeguards are rare at Greek beaches, though most of them where people congregate to swim are locally considered safe. Some beaches have shallow water a long way from the shore; others suddenly shelve steeply. If in doubt about safe swimming conditions, ask locally.\nThere are no required inoculations for Greece and the water is almost everywhere safe (see above under Drink.) Look for 'Blue Flags' at beaches for the highest quality water (which tend to also have good sand and facilities)\n\n\nRespect\nGreeks rate politeness with a person's behaviour and not their words. Furthermore, there is an air of informality; everybody is treated like a cousin. They use their hands to gesture a lot. Have fun with this. Sometimes over-emphasizing politeness in spoken language will only make the person dealing with you think you are pretentious. It's nice to learn basic words like \"thank you\" (\u0395\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ce: ef-khah-rees-TOH) or \"please\" (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce: pah-rah-kah-LOH).\nGreeks generally consider it proper etiquette to let the stranger make the first move. You may find that on entering a cafe or passing a group on the street you feel that you're being ignored, but if you take the initiative by saying hello first, you're likely to find that people suddenly turn friendly. In the countryside it is not uncommon that total strangers will greet you, greet them back in kind. Greeks like to smalltalk, and when they get carried away smalltalking, they might even forget what they were doing to begin with, ending up drinking raki with you.\nGreeks are often incorrectly stereotyped as \"lazy\". In actuality, Greeks take leisure very seriously. Don't take perceived laziness or rudeness harshly. Keep in mind that Greeks have a strong work ethic. \nDress codes for churches sometimes include covered shoulders for women and knees covered for both sexes, but generally they don't mind about your clothes as long as they are not very provocative. This tends to be lightly enforced during the height of the summer tourist season, simply due to sheer volume! In any case, appropriate clothing is usually available at the entrance of churches and monasteries, especially the ones receiving most tourist traffic. Just pick it up going in and drop it off on the way out.\nNudism: Regulary tourists are annoying the locals, because too much skin is shown at the beaches. Nudity is not so common in the Greek public. Also topless is not accepted outside the tourist areas. Nevertheless there are on all shores of the mainland and on most of the islands nudist beaches where nudism is tolerated and even nudist hotels in Crete, Rhodes, Kefalonia, and Zakynthos.\n\n\nSocial etiquette and breaches\nRespect for elders is very important in Greece. Greeks place a high emphasis on family values and it is common for Greek parents to be intimately involved in the lives of their children. Try to act in a mature, sensible fashion around someone older than you and try not do anything that would make an older person or other authority figure feel challenged.\nGreeks value transparency and loyalty. Don't say something if you don't mean it. Don't say \"next time\" if there isn't going to be a \"next time\".\nIt's common for Greeks to ask you personal questions. It's completely normal for them to ask about your family life, about your vocation, and the like. It may, however, be crass to discuss someone's religious convictions or their salary, matters which are normally considered private in many parts of the world.\nGreeks are hospitable and will go to any length to make you feel comfortable. If you've been offered food by your Greek host(s), sample everything on your plate. \nNever say or imply that a Greek person is untrustworthy or unreliable; this is considered insulting.\n\n\nSensitive issues\nAvoid saying that Greece is part of Eastern Europe. Greece is generally considered part of Southern Europe.\nAvoid saying that Greece is a Balkan country; Greeks generally dislike this label.\nAvoid making strong comments about Greek history in general; Greeks take pride in their country's history and are proud of what their country has given to the world. \nDiscussing politics is not a social faux pas in Greece; in fact, the Greeks may delight you with conversations about how frustrated they are with their government.  As is the case in any foreign country, foreign criticism of Greece's government and politicians is seldom appreciated.\n\n\nNational issues\nGiven Greece's history of enduring turbulent events, the Greeks exhibit sensitivity towards various historical occurrences.\nYou should avoid discussing the following topics as they can quickly unsettle people:\n\nThe Macedonian issue: Greeks consider that the name \"Macedonia\" is stolen from them and used by Tito's partisans in southern Yugoslavia to address the country created after World War II as a new constituent republic within Yugoslavia by Tito. The Greeks refer to it as \"FYRoM\" or the \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" when dealing with foreigners and as Skopia (The Greek name of the Macedonian capital Skopje) among themselves. In February 2019, the country was officially renamed the Republic of North Macedonia in order to settle the dispute.\nThe military junta of the late 1960s to mid 1970s: some groups suffered severe repression and view its leaders with utter resentment.\nAvoid making strong comments about the Greek debt crisis \u2013 during the crisis many Greeks lost a great deal of purchasing power, lost their jobs, and moved abroad in search of better opportunities. Never say or imply that the Greeks \"deserved\" their economic demise; remember there is a clear distinction between Greek people and the Greek government.\nGreece's relationship with Turkey \u2013 after centuries of Ottoman occupation and domination, there's still some resentment towards Turkey. If you happen to be the most ardent Turkophile in the world, avoid being overly enthusiastic about Turkey in front of Greeks as it can easily arouse strong emotions.\nIn some circles, Greece being under Ottoman rule and the Greek genocide can very easily incite fierce, passionate, emotional debates.\n\n\nReligion\nThe Greek Orthodox Church, part of the Eastern Orthodox communion, is the state religion, and nominally adhered to by over 80% of Greeks. However, freedom of religion is also constitutionally guaranteed, and contemporary Greek society is in practice rather secular. Most Greeks do not attend church regularly every Sunday, but instead only show up for important occasions such as Christmas and Easter. That said, the Greek Orthodox Church is still an important part of the Greek national identity, and many Greeks see it as integral to being Greek, so try not to criticise it unless you know your listener well.\n\n\nObscene gestures\n\nHolding up your palm with your fingers extended outwards is rude in Greece, and is akin to giving someone the middle finger. This gesture, known as Mountza, is thought to originate from the days of the Byzantine Empire. \n\n\nSmoking\nGreeks smoke tremendously, and they see cigarettes as a birthright. Smoking is prohibited by law in all public places like restaurants and cafeterias. A hotline (1142) can be used to report people and establishments breaking the smoking ban, and Greeks have not been shy about using it. You will rarely, if ever, see people smoking in such places and it is best to step outside when you want to smoke.\nGreece is subject to frequent forest fires during the dry summer season, so definitely avoid smoking in forested areas! The penalties for this can be especially severe.\n\n\nFire ban\nThere is a strict fire ban in all of Greece from May 1 until October 31, corresponding to the fire-prone dry season, and this inculdes bans for every outdoor activity that could cause a forest fire, including campfires, cookouts and fireworks. There are stiff penalties for violating the fire ban, and much stiffer penalties if you start a forest fire.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nPhone\n\n\nMobile internet\nThere are no Internet roaming charges for EU citizens, so you can surf the Internet in Greece as normal with your local sim card. For Non-EU citizens, you can either buy a Greek sim card or use a virtual sim cards where you can buy the GB you want as credit at home and then surf the internet anywhere in Greece until the credit is used up. This is easier than buying a Greek sim card.\nThere are at least three mobile carriers, Cosmote, Wind and Vodafone all of which require by law presenting some form of identification in order to activate your prepaid plan. Choose whichever has better reception in your area; GSM 900, GSM 1800 and UMTS 2100 bands are supported. Data usage is cheap. Ask the mobile carrier for more information.\nMobile phone carriers support data roaming with 2G, 3G, 4G and LTE technologies.\n\n\nCalling\nThe cheapest way to call someone abroad \u2013 and this is really cheap \u2013 is to use a pre-paid calling card and call from a land line anywhere (also from your hotel room). Pre-paid calling cards are sold in many shops and kiosks. The calling card is not much more than a phone number and a pin code, which you dial prior to dialling the usual phone number. If you want to call internationally, ask for an international calling card. For \u20ac1 you can call for about 45 minutes, so buy a card in the cheapest value (which is about \u20ac3). Calling someone for half an hour is cheaper than sending one email from an internet caf\u00e9. Cards expire usually 90 days after first use. You can also use this pre-paid calling card at public phone boxes, which are widely available.\nMobile phones are prevalent in Greek's communication, and if you need to talk with your fellow travellers it is advised that you buy a local prepaid plan instead of using roaming, as it is far cheaper. \n\n\nInternet\nInternet access is widely available throughout the country. Almost all hotels provide internet access, either free or paid. Local coffee shops usually offer free Wi-Fi access, as many other public places do. Feel free to ask for the password, if the network is locked.\n\n\nNews\nYou can have an update from various news agencies that provide Greek news in English like the official Athenian-Macedonian news agency and Reuters, \u0395\u03a1\u03a4 Greek Edition (the public broadcaster), IN (the oldest news active Greek news site) or Kathimerini English Edition (a daily newspaper published in Athens and distributed exclusively with the International New York Times in Greece and Cyprus) but it's always safer to keep in touch with locals (for example in the case of a fire in a nearby location that you planned to visit).\n\n\nGo next\nThe land border can be crossed to Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Albania.\nGreece has ultra-low-cost flights to many European countries, Jordan, Israel, Georgia and to the United Arab Emirates.",
