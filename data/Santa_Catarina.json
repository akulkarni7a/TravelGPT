It is one of the wealthiest and more developed states of the country, also containing the most popular beaches of Brazil's South region.\n\n\nHistory\nEuropean settlement began with the Spanish settlement of Santa Catarina island in 1542. The Portuguese took control in 1675 and established the captaincy of Santa Catarina in 1738, bringing families from the Azores to populate the shore.\nIn 1839, during the Ragamuffin War, there was an unsuccessful attempt for Santa Catarina to secede from the Empire of Brazil to form the independent Juliana Republic (allied with the Riograndense Republic to the south) which was thwarted in four months. Between the early 19th century and mid-20th century, a great number of European immigrants arrived in Santa Catarina; these immigrants were taken to populate the south of the nation by Imperial initiative. About 50% of these immigrants were from Germany and Austria. The rest came mainly from Italy, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Lithuania, France, Finland, Croatia, Serbia, Estonia, Slovenia and Latvia; these immigrants created an abundance of small, family-held farms, many of which continue to exist in the interior of the state.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nNational and international flights arrive at Herc\u00edlio Luz Airport in Florian\u00f3polis and Victor Konder in Navegantes.\nDomestic flights arrive at Serafim Bertaso Airport in Chapec\u00f3 and Lauro Carneiro de Loyola in JoinvilleRegional flights arrive at Diom\u00edcio Freitas Airport in Forquilhinha/Crici\u00fama, Carlos Alberto da Costa Neves in Ca\u00e7ador and Municipal de Joa\u00e7aba.\n\n\nBy car\nThe BR-101 crosses the state in a north-south direction along the coast, is duplicated in the North section and in the final phase of duplication in the South section.

It has a single track and dangerous stretches of mountains.\nAnother important connection is the BR-470, which leaves Navegantes westwards, passing through the Itaja\u00ed Valley, where there is intense vehicle traffic.
