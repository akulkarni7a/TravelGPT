  "extract": "Boulogne-Billancourt is a wealthy area in the inner south-western suburbs of Paris. With its approximately 121,000 inhabitants (2018), it is the most populous municipality in the Paris urban area after the city of Paris, and one of the most densely populated. Although not a major tourist hub, it is nonetheless worth a visit for its 1930s heritage.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGeography\nBordered by the river Seine to the south and west, by the Bois de Boulogne to the north and by the 16th arrondissement of Paris, Boulogne-Billancourt is the most populous municipality in Ile-de-France after Paris 'intramuros'. Its central position on the old East-West road of Versailles, between the Royal Palace of the Louvre is at the origin of its development. Today, it continues to develop thanks to its intermediate position on the north-south axis, between the economic hubs of La D\u00e9fense and V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay.\n\n\nHistory\nFor nearly two centuries, Boulogne-Billancourt has been known for its technological innovation, home to the first suspension bridge in 1824, the design of the first automobile gearbox, and the first place outside Paris intramuros to be connected to the Paris metro in 1934. The cultural golden age of Boulogne-Billancourt was undoubtedly the inter-war period, and more precisely that of the 1930s, which results in it being home to a large amount of notable Art Deco architecture from that period. It was also during the first half of the 20th century that Boulogne became the city of aircraft engines and cinema, and saw the establishment of the vast factories of the car manufacturer Renault (on what is now the Ile Seguin), whose primary headquarters are still found in the suburb.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n \n \n\n\nBy metro\nThe suburb is primarily served by metro lines  9  (Pont de S\u00e8vres, Billancourt and Marcel Sembat) and  10  (Pont de Saint-Cloud, Jean Jaur\u00e8s), and is in fare zone 2. Line 10 feels like it belongs in a museum from the Second World War and is quite fun to ride. The new line 15 is scheduled to open in the mid-2020s as part of the Grand Paris Express scheme, and will connect Pont de S\u00e8vres station with the surrounding inner suburbs of Paris.\n\n\nBy tram\nParc de Saint-Cloud station on tram line T 2  is a short walk across the river Seine from Pont de Saint-Cloud metro station, as is Brimborion station from Pont de S\u00e8vres metro station.\n\n\nBy train\nAlthough the RER does not serve the commune directly, the RER  C  serves Issy - Val de Seine station located just across the Seine in the neighbouring commune of Issy.\n\n\nGet around\nTwo free shuttle bus routes around the commune are provided by the Service Urbain de Boulogne-Billancourt (SUBB), and are adapted for people with disabilities. A map and timetable are provided on the council website.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Albert Kahn Museum (Mus\u00e9e Albert-Kahn), 10 Rue du Port (Pont de Saint-Cloud 10 ).
