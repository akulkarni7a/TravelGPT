  "extract": "Niter\u00f3i (515,000 inhabitants as of 2020) is the former capital of Rio de Janeiro state, in southeastern Brazil. Nicknamed \"The Smile City\" (Cidade Sorriso), \"NKT\" and \"Nikiti\" (nee-KITSCH--ee), it is just a short ferry ride from downtown Rio across Guanabara Bay. In fact you may encounter plenty of reasons to smile about: many beautiful beaches (within the bay or facing the open ocean), historic forts and a world-class museum. Besides, Niter\u00f3i is scheduled to become in a near future the place with the largest number of works from renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer, second only to the capital of Brazil, Bras\u00edlia.\n\n\nUnderstand\nNiter\u00f3i is the first of the 7 municipalities of Leste Metropolitano, the sub-region of the metropolitan agglomeration of Rio de Janeiro on the east side of the Guanabara Bay. Since it has the highest HDI in the state of Rio, Niter\u00f3i polarizes this portion of the metropolis, receiving every day many workers (commuters) as well as other people who live in the other municipalities of this sub-region (S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, Itabora\u00ed, Tangu\u00e1, Maric\u00e1, Rio Bonito and Cachoeiras de Macacu) and look for goods and services in the city, although the metropolitan core is the downtown area of Rio de Janeiro, which, in turn, polarizes the entire metropolitan area and receives commuters from the 7 municipalities of Leste Metropolitano, the 13 municipalities of Baixada Fluminense, besides the over 160 neighborhoods of the municipality of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\nGet in\n\nFrom the center of the state capital, it is possible to go to Niter\u00f3i by urban bus, van and ferry lines. Several bus lines to Niter\u00f3i depart from Terminal Menezes C\u00f4rtes, in Castelo, and from the Candel\u00e1ria region - both in downtown Rio. The ferries depart from Pra\u00e7a XV station. Vans to Niter\u00f3i depart from the Central do Brasil area.\nThere is also the  Rodovi\u00e1ria Roberto Silveira. , in downtown Niter\u00f3i, a long-distance bus station through which visitors coming from outside the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro can arrive directly in the municipality of Niter\u00f3i.\nThe main road access to Niter\u00f3i for those coming from the Rio de Janeiro Central Zone is the Rio-Niter\u00f3i bridge (BR-101 highway).\n\n\nBy boat\nThe ferry between Rio and Niteroi is a pleasant and affordable trip. It takes between 10 and 20 minutes to cross the bay, depending on the fare for a slow or fast boat from adjoining terminals at Pra\u00e7a XV.\n\n\nBy car or bus\nFrom Rio you just drive through the longest bridge in Brazil, the Ponte Rio-Niter\u00f3i; just like the name says it connects both cities. It's 13 km (8 mi) long, and there is a toll of R$ 3,20 (you pay one way only, coming from Rio).\nIf you are coming from B\u00fazios or Cabo Frio you take the highway called \"Via-lagos\".\n\n\nGet around\n\nOn Saturdays and Sundays the \"Linha Turismo\" (Tourism Line) operates on schedule leaving the Arariboia Square (@ the Fery Station) at 10:00, 12:30 and 14:30 and making 7 different stops along Niteroi's main attractions from downtown to the Fortress (R$10 for a round-trip all day hop in and out ticket).\nTo get to the Oceanic Area you'd better have a car, otherwise take a municipal bus at the Bus Terminal next to the Ferry Station. Look for the specific Beach name sign on the bus(30~40~50 minutes ride from downtown to Piratininga/Camboinhas ~ Itacoatiara ~ Itaipu respectively ).\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Niter\u00f3i Contemporary Art Museum (Museu de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea de Niter\u00f3i \u2014 MAC), Mirante da Boa Viagem (Get bus 47B from the bus terminal on your left when you exit the ferry station), \u260f +55 21 2620-2400. Tu-Su 10:00-18:00, or 19:00 during daylight savings time. Built in 1996, this intriguing contemporary art museum looks like a flying saucer jutting out over the sea and is worth the visit to Niteroi alone. R$ 4.   \n2 People's Theater (Teatro Popular Oscar Niemeyer) (beyond the Bus Terminal to your left as you exit the Ferry Station), \u260f +55 21 8449-7393. Opened in 2007 this is the new addition to the Caminho Niemyer (Niemeyer Way), a series of Architectural buildings along Niteroi's Bayside.   \n3 Parque da Cidade. An amazing view of Rio de Janeiro (city). Watching the sunset from there is a 'must do' if you are in Rio. It is on the top of a mountain in the 'Charitas' neighborhood. You can go there by car / taxi.   \nFortaleza de Santa Cruz (1555)- at the Guanabara Bay entrance, this is a big fortress with a close-up view of the Sugar Loaf Mountain from an entirely different angle.(R$4 guided tours) Th-Su 10:00-17:00. To get here on the weekdays you will need a car/taxi, but on Sat and Sun you can take a tourist open bus (called Jardineira)in downtown Niteroi at the Ferry Station. It runs all the way along the bayshore and stops at the town's main attractions and neighborhoods.\nBar\u00e3o do Rio Branco (1555), Imbu\u00ed (1863/1901) and S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds (1715/1775) Forts - enter at Rio Branco Fort in Jurujuba for a guided tours of this and the other 2 forts and ruins overlooking the bay with a splendid view of the surrounding mountains of Niter\u00f3i and Rio. (R$6 each Fort) Al. Mal. Pessoa Leal, 265 - Sa Su 09:30-16:00.\n\n\nBeaches\nNiter\u00f3i has a wonderful unique view of Rio and one of the state's most beautiful beaches, Itacoatiara, which can be reached by bus number 38. It is considered a surfer's paradise (actually it takes part of a world circuit of Surfer's Competition). Expect a young and beautiful crowd, have a snack at one of the healthy cabana-bars along the shore or yet, take trails to climb the mountains and watch a uniquely crazy sport: \"Rock Surfing\".\nNot further from here you can find the \"lost in time\" Itaipu Beach, a fishermen's colony surrounded by sand dunes, a lagoon, a canal, a white church on a hill and some colonial era ruins. It is probably one of the best sunsets you can see over Rio's shoreline (Copacabana, Ipanema, the Cagarra islands and Barra da Tijuca on the horizon). Also worthwhile is a visit to next door Camboinhas Beach (it's easier and faster to hire a fisherman's boat to cross the canal than driving around the lagoon to get there). Other beaches include: Piratininga, Prainha (cliff diving from the Whale Rock) and Sossego, all on the Atlantic side. Boa Viagem, Ing\u00e1, Icara\u00ed, S\u00e3o Francisco, Charitas, Jurujuba (fishermen village, not proper for bathing) and Ad\u00e3o & Eva, all along the Bay, starting at downtown and ending at the Fortress.\n\n\nDo\n\nShopping - Icara\u00ed is where the upper middle class lives. So there are plenty of nice shops for all tastes. \"Moreira C\u00e9sar\" (1st street parallel to the beach) is the most popular shopping street in town. Here you will find exclusive and expensive boutiques such as Animale, Agilita, H.Stern, Salinas (beachware) all the way down to little t-shirt shops. There are plenty of exotic juice bars and little restaurantes here as well. Don't leave town without tasting a\u00e7a\u00ed, a Brazilian palm fruit from the Amazonas, served very cold, and has a very earthy flavor.\nMeanwhile in Downtown (Centro), the Plaza Shopping is the largest shopping mall in town, across from the ferry station (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o das Barcas). Here you will find basically all the stores that you would find in any mall in nearby Rio de Janeiro.\nNiter\u00f3i Shopping is also a mall in downtown (Rua da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o). Even though this is not at the same level of Plaza Shopping, is a landmark, very easy to find, since it is the tallest round building you can see.\n\nIcara\u00ed is to Niter\u00f3i what Copacabana is to Rio's residents: the most traditional neighborhood with excellent shopping opportunities and great restaurants. Great for jogging and biking with a view of Rio's main landmarks across the Guanabara Bay, the Sugar Loaf and the Corcovado. How can you ask for more?\nNightlife - \"S\u00e3o Francisco\" the adjacent neighborhood is filled with lively bars, pubs and restaurants especially on the ocean front. There are not many discos in Niter\u00f3i as people prefer to go to Rio to dance.\nHang-glide from Parque da Cidade (see above)\nWindsurf in Charitas and S\u00e3o Francisco\nCliff Diving in Prainha or Piratininga\nGuanabara Bay Tour - 2-hour bay cruise on a ferry where a camera is a must.

R$12\n\n\nBuy\n\nSouvenirs from Niter\u00f3i, like T-shirts and magnets, can be bought at the Tourist Information Office. There's a cabin located right at the ferry station exit. Here you can get brochures, maps and tourist tram schedule also. If you go to S\u00e3o Francisco neighborhood the main office is located to your left right after the tunnel and before you reach the beach.\n\n\nEat\n\nAll restaurants are reasonably priced by American and European standards.\n\n A Mineira, Av.
