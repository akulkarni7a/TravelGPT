  "extract": "Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, is a city on the Atlantic coast. Natal has some great beaches, historical sites, and nature areas, and it is a frequently used base for exploring the paradisiac beaches and nature of the Rio Grande do Norte state.\n\n\nDistricts\nSouth: The most affluent area of the city and also where most tourists stay. Contains the Ponta Negra beach and most upscale hotels, shopping malls and restaurants\nEast: Contains the city's Historical Center, important sights such as Forte dos Reis Magos and Ponte de Todos, and beaches that mix visitors and locals such as Praia do Meio and Praia dos Artistas. Also contains the entrance to Parque das Dunas\nNorth: An industrial/working class area which is now the most populous of Natal. Contains the Redinha beach, which provides some nice views of the city and with very local feel\nWest: A mostly poor and in some parts run-down area, it contains the intercity bus terminal that can be used to reach other cities, like Tibau do Sul\n\n\nUnderstand\nNatal was founded on 25 December 1599, hence its name (Natal means Christmas in Portuguese). Unlike other Northeastern capitals, it did not quite benefit from the economic boom resulting from the region's sugar cane production. Instead it grew moderately and more organizedly, burgeoning on the state's cattle-raising activities and salt and oil extraction.\nNowadays Natal is one of the 8 most visited cities of Brazil. Unlike other large cities of the  Northeast of Brazil, like Recife or Salvador, Natal does not have a fascinating Historical Center or a vivid nightlife. In contrast, it is regarded as being significantly calmer  than other large cities in the region, and as having a superior quality of life. Many rich Brazilians and foreigners alike have summer houses in the city.\nOne of the primary reasons to visit Natal is to use it as a base to explore the wonderful state of Rio Grande do Norte, including beaches like Pipa, Ba\u00eda Formosa, Barra do Cunha\u00fa and Genipabu, and lakes like Carcar\u00e1 and Coca-Cola (See #Go next). The city has many lodging options and a couple of good and reasonably priced restaurants.\n\n\nClimate\n\nNatal is a sunny and warm city with a pleasant tropical climate. The rainy season occurs between the months of March and July. Temperatures never reach extremes, thanks to the trade winds coming from the ocean, with averages between 23 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), stable throughout the year.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Governador Alu\u00edzio Alves International Airport (Aeroporto Internacional Governador Alu\u00edzio Alves NAT  IATA) (25 km from Natal's center, located at S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Amarante city).   \nThere are numerous direct flights from Brazilian cities, including Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Campinas, Fernando de Noronha, Fortaleza, Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Salvador, and S\u00e3o Paulo. TAP flies daily to Lisbon.\nTo get to the city, take the Natal bus at the doorstep of the terminal. To get to Ponta Negra, get off after about 15 minutes at Natal Shopping, cross the pedestrian bridge and take any bus with Ponta Negra in its name for R$4 (June 2021).\nA taxi to Ponta Negra costs a fixed price, possibly a few R$ cheaper on the meter. It takes about 40 minutes.\n\nYou may also want to consider flying to the airports of Recife  or Jo\u00e3o Pessoa. From there you can take an intercity bus or a shared ride with Blablacar to Natal.\n\n\nBy bus\nNatal's bus station is about 3 km southwest of the city center, and some 5 km northwest of the Ponta Negra beach. Bus No 66 does the same run in about 45 minutes.\n\nFrom Fortaleza 8 times daily (3 of these stopping in Mossor\u00f3) by Nordeste. 8-10 hours. Also by Guanabara.\nFrom Recife by Progresso, 4\u00bd hours.\nFrom Jo\u00e3o Pessoa every hour.\nFrom Pipa there are direct buses. Alternatively you can take a minibus to Goianinha for R$4.50 (May 2021) and then a minibus to Natal for R$10 (May 2021). If you want to go to Ponta Negra in Natal, exit at Natal Shopping. Go over the pedestrian bridge and take any bus that says Ponta Negra on the windshield.\nIf you want to go to the Vila de Ponta Negra in the south-east, take the bus line 73 from Natal Shopping.\n\n\nBy ride-sharing\nFrom Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Fortaleza, Recife and Pipa you can find rides on Blablacar.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\n\nFor finding local bus connections, Moovit covers the city.\n(As of June 2021) a bus ticket in Natal is R$4 and you don't need a bus card. Without a bus card you don't need to find a way to get and to recharge it. With a bus card it's possible to get a second bus without paying if this is done in less than one hour after the first one.\nFrom the shopping centres Midway Mall, Via Direta and Natal Shopping you can find a bus to almost everywhere in the city. The \"Line R\" bus of Trampolim da Vit\u00f3ria company goes from Midway Mall to the International Airport for R$2.50 and is the only one going there.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nUber and 99Taxi are available.\n\n\nBy car\nRenting a car may be convenient if you, as many  visitors, plan to use Natal as a base for day trips outside the city. Even the beaches at the neighbouring municipalities of Parnamarim and Extremoz are complicated to reach using public transport.\n\n\nBy buggy\nYou may explore the coast on the beach rather than a road, by hiring the service of a dune Buggy driver. You can book a vehicle or join a group. You may find services that are cheaper than others, but be aware of unlicensed drivers; accidents caused by unskilled buggy drivers sometimes occur.\n\n\nBy urban trains\nThey are cheap, but do not reach any major tourist sights.\n\n\nSee\n\n Forte dos Reis Magos (Fortaleza dos Reis Magos), Avenida Presidente Caf\u00e9 Filho, s/n, Praia do Forte (next to Ponte Newton Navarro), \u260f +55 84 3202-2006.

It is located in the water, accessible using a pedestrian path from Praia do Forte. For about 300 years, it worked as military quarters, administration office and prision, and it was also for some time under Dutch control. The name of the fortress is due to the statues of the Biblical Magi in the entrance. R$ 3. \n Ponte Newton Navarro (Ponte de Todos).

It is Brazil, so you should be aware of the recommended safety precautions: watch your belongings, travel well lit streets at night, don't go wandering off to deserted places you don't know and try to avoid walking around alone. If you are driving and following the GPS, pay close attention to where you are going to make sure you aren't entering a slum of sorts. Tourists should be particularly careful in the beaches of the East Side and North Side - in particular, one should never walk alone from Praia do Forte to Forte dos Reis Magos - the area is scarcely policed. Go to Forte dos Reis Magos by taxi or by a guided tour. It is relatively safe to walk around Ponta Negra, though, since that is the main tourist spot.
