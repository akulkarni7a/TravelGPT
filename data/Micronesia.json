  "extract": "Micronesia, in northwest Oceania, is the home of tropical and subtropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. With the exceptions of Kiribati and Nauru, most of Micronesia is associated with the United States.\n\n\nCountries and territories\n\n\nCities\n1 Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a \u2013 the capital of Guam\n2 Kolonia \u2013 the former Federated States of Micronesian capital\n3 Koror \u2013 Palau's largest city is an excellent location for snorkelling\n4 Majuro \u2013 the capital of the Marshall Islands\n5 Melekeok  \u2013 Palau's minuscule capital resembles more like a hamlet, but its capitol building is impressive from an architectural standpoint\n6 Tarawa, Kiribati\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Nan Madol \u2014 a ruined city, sometimes called the Venice of the Pacific, in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia\n2 War in the Pacific National Historical Park  \u2014 in Guam, some of the best preserved WWII sights in the Pacific can be found here\n3 Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument \u2013 a marine United States national monument that includes many random islands and atolls lying in the middle of the Pacific\n\n\nUnderstand\nMicronesia is a vast area that mainly consists of water. Transport can be a major issue because of the lack of an organized highway or byway, found in larger countries. Due to the lack of space on the islands, most activities are nautical, scuba diving etc.\n\n\nTalk\nEnglish is an official language of all countries and territories here. Indigenous languages such as Chamorro, Palauan and Marshallese are also official in their respective countries and territories.\n\n\nGet in\nPalau and Guam have the best connections from outside Micronesia. The US territories, insomuch that civilians are allowed to enter, are connected to the US. As the airports often aren't large enough to accommodate large airplanes, expect flights to be of the island-to-island type which often means several landings and takeoffs before you're at your destination.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\nThere are three world heritage sites in Micronesia:\n\nThe Bikini Atoll Nuclear Test Site, Ralik, Marshall Islands\nThe Rock Islands outside Koror, Palau\nThe site of Nan Madol outside Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia\n\n\nDo\n\n\nBuy\nThere are only two currencies used in Micronesia: the Australian dollar and the United States dollar. Nauru and Kiribati use the Australian dollar, while all other countries and territories use the US dollar.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nCope\nMicronesia does not host many foreign embassies.\n\n\nGo next\nThere are regular flights from some of the islands to East and Southeast Asia.\n\nAustralia\nFiji\nHawaii",
