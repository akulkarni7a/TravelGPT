  "extract": "Soldeu and El Tarter lie in the parish (administrative division) of Canillo some 17 km north-east of Andorra's capital between Andorra La Vella and the French border at Pas de la Casa (2085 m). Arguably the best known area in Andorra for skiing, Soldeu and El Tarter (neighbour villages) are lively, good value for money, modern and friendly, with great skiing and snowboarding facilities.  In summer, Soldeu is popular with walkers and golfers who make the most of the beautiful scenery.  In winter the Soldeu weather conditions change dramatically with excellent snow conditions providing excellent terrain for skiing and snowboarding.\n\n\nGet in\nTake the CG1 direction Soldeu, Pas de la Casa and France. There is no train service in Andorra, so to get to Soldeu you need to drive or take a bus.  If you are travelling by plane the closest airports serving Andorra are Barcelona, Girona and Toulouse.  There are limited flights to Lleida.\nOnce at the airport you can hire a car, take a taxi/minibus or use a private transfer service.  The transfer time is approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes from Barcelona or Girona, and approximately 3 hours from Toulouse.\n\n\nGet around\nThe national bus service runs through Soldeu both in the direction of Pas de la Casa and the French border, and in the direction of Andorra la Vella (the capital city of Andorra) where there are frequent connections nationally and internationally.  There isn't a train service in Andorra and there is no airport, the closest being La Seu d'Urgell in Spain, although this is very small.\nThere isn't a taxi rank in Soldeu, the nearest being in Andorra la Vella.\n\n\nSee\nWonderful scenery and skiing at these resorts.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nSkiing\nThe skiing in Soldeu is good for all levels, and there are some advanced descents for the more experienced skier through the powder fields below Pic d'Encampadana.\nFor snowboarders, Soldeu\u2019s half pipe and an additional natural half-pipe makes the resort a popular choice.
