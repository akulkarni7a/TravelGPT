  "extract": "This article is about local travel. For information on long-distance trains and buses, see Rail travel and Bus travel. For rail transportation systems which are an attraction in their own right, See urban rail adventures.\nPublic transportation is organized passenger transportation. In big cities it is often provided by buses, different rail systems (such as metro, commuter rail and trams), and it may be provided also by funiculars, monorail, ferries and other more unusual modes of transport.\n\nDepending on the country, commuter rail can be virtually identical to longer-distance trains while mostly fulfilling an urban rail role. Ticketing can be integrated with railways (e.g. in Germany), with other local and regional transport, or separate (e.g. in the US).\nWhile comfort and reliability vary a lot, in Europe and East Asia, it is usually the most practical way to get around in large cities.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nMost urban rail systems are part of a government-subsidized public transport network and many carry large numbers of passengers, especially in larger cities; the Tokyo system averages over 8 million a day and Shanghai almost 7 million. These systems therefore almost always cost less than taxicabs and are often both faster than driving and cheaper than paying for parking. However, there are fairly often problems with overcrowding, especially at rush hours. So as the quotable late New York Yankees baseball player Yogi Berra used to say: \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\"\nWith oil prices generally on the rise, and political concern for environmental protection and CO2 emissions becoming more and more important, almost all countries and cities that have rapid transit systems are in the process of upgrading, modernizing and expanding their networks sometimes very rapidly. Unfortunately, this can also mean construction sites that slow down traffic, and information about a public transit system can be outdated despite being only a few years or even months old.\nThe urban rail system is usually extended by buses, in some cases within the same ticket system. On the other hand most urban rail systems of more than token size serve the city's mainline train station(s) (often having a hub at one or several of them) and integrated tickets are becoming increasingly common. Sometimes a train ticket already includes one ride on the urban rail system of your departure and/or origin city to enable \"door to door\" travel. This is true for instance for all train tickets in Germany that have \"+City\" printed on them.\nSome see the iconic maps of the New York Subway or London Underground for the first time and get intimidated. They see a mishmash of colors and can't make head or tail of it. But once it's explained to them, they get their head around it. Not only is it not that complicated, it's actually brilliant. Soon they'll be doing it like an expert, knowing where to switch lines in order to get from A to B.\n\n\nTypes of public transportation\nPublic transportation is provided by many types of vehicles:\n\nRail vehicles:\nRapid transit or metro is a local passenger rail network with grade separation from other traffic. The terms subway and underground indicate that many rapid transit lines go below ground. However, by no means all transit lines are underground (regardless of name); elevated and surface rail is widely used as well. Fully grade separated rail systems are the only ones to commonly be operated automatically.\nLight rail typically moves at ground level, often with small vehicles of shorter range that are known as trams or streetcars: tracks can either be in the street, or on a separate trackbed. While the first trams in the early 19th century were horse-drawn or steam-powered, many cities worldwide either replaced them with electric streetcars or built new systems from scratch towards the end of the 19th century, but with the rise of the automobile many fell from favor and were either removed or left to disintegrate. Now, however, with the increased popularity of public transport in much of the world, many cities are re-instating and re-invigorating their tram systems for the 21st century. Some notable examples of cities with light rail networks are Barcelona, Cologne, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Sarajevo, Amsterdam, Denver, Vienna, Manchester, Melbourne, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Sydney, Toronto, New Orleans and Lisbon. In Belgium one single line connects the entire coast end to end. Streetcars experienced a renaissance starting in France in the 1970s and many cities in Europe now have comprehensive systems that are often not only the cheapest and most environmentally friendly but also the fastest way around town. Central and Eastern Europe also tend to have dense networks as they were slower to dismantle their streetcar systems and are almost universally reinvigorating and modernizing their systems, sometimes even building new lines that run on dedicated tracks.\nCommuter trains are local passenger trains, either on the national rail network, or on dedicated regional networks. While commuter trains are usually part of the local transit ticket system, furnishing is minimal; toilets and refreshments are usually absent. The German term S-Bahn has spread to other German-speaking countries as well and inspired terms such as Esko (Prague) or S-Tog (Copenhagen). In North America commuter train systems are often known by the acronym of the governing authority, e.g. BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in the San Francisco Bay Area and GO trains in the Toronto region.\nUnusual forms of rail are sometimes used, for single lines if not whole systems. For example,\nSeattle built an elevated monorail line for the 1962 World's Fair that is still in service;\nChongqing has several monorail lines; Shanghai has a magnetic levitation line to Pudong Airport with speeds over 400 km/h (250 mph);\nthe German city of Wuppertal has had a suspension railway since 1901; and\nMorgantown, West Virginia, USA, has a Personal Rapid Transit system.\nSome very hilly cities and a number of cities in developing countries also use funicular railways to climb steep inclines.\nRoad vehicles:\nEspecially in suburbs and smaller cities, the public transit network is made up of buses. Some have double-decker buses, which can give a great view.\nThere are variants of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) where buses have dedicated infrastructure. Much of Ottawa's system uses buses on dedicated roads called the Transitway while cities such as Xiamen have Bus Rapid Transit using elevated bus-only roads. Other notable examples of BRT are found in Curitiba and Bogot\u00e1, which first brought BRT to the mainstream. BRT is distinguished from normal bus service by using dedicated lanes, traffic signal preemption, offboard fare collection, and stations with level boarding, and is often given distinctive branding. Proponents of BRT argue that it offers similar benefits to rail, at much lower cost, while being faster to implement. Not all such traffic runs on bus-only roads; often some lanes on normal roads are restricted to buses, at least during rush hours, and in some systems the core has special roads but out at the periphery the buses continue via normal roads. Given the inherent perception of the term, BRT is sometimes applied by local government or opponents of rail transit as a term for systems hardly distinct from regular bus systems. The Netherlands also has its form of BRT, mainly served by R-net.\nTrolley-buses don't run on rails either but as their motive power is provided through overhead wires, their mobility is tied to a pre-built network much like that of systems running on rails. They were an important part of public transportation in the former eastern bloc and remain important in those countries as well as in Canada and Switzerland. The Dutch city of Arnhem is well known for its trolley buses, with \"trolleystad\" - meaning trolley city - being its nickname.\nCable cars or aerial passenger tramways carry passengers high above crowded streets. While they often offer spectacular views and may be the only way to get up steep slopes, their maintenance may prove challenging. Cities with such systems include Dresden, Medellin, and Mexico City.\nWhile escalators and elevators are usually set up for indoor transportation, they are part of the public transportation system (sometimes with a ticket required) in some hilly cities such as Hong Kong and Valletta.\nFerries are used for public transportation in waterfront locations, such as Venice, Lisbon, Sydney and the Stockholm archipelago. A variant of this form of transport is the river bus, which is a major backbone of the public transportation network in Bangkok.\nEach of these methods is used in some cities, and it is fairly common for a single city to combine several. For example, Shanghai's system mainly uses underground rail lines downtown and elevated lines in the suburbs, and it also includes an extensive bus network, a fast magnetic levitation rail line to Pudong Airport and a tram system in one suburban neighborhood.\nNearly all such systems offer convenient connections to other transport. For local travel, most metro stations have bus or tram stops nearby, some have a major terminus for buses or trams, and many have a taxi stand. For long distance travel, nearly all rapid transit systems offer convenient connections to railway stations and airports. In London, for example, all the railway terminals and Heathrow Airport are on the underground, and the other airports can be reached by trains which depart from underground stations.\n\n\nGet in\n\nTo ride public transport, you usually need a ticket. Where to buy it and how to validate it varies. Tickets are usually available from offices of the responsible agency and at railway and underground stations. They are often available also from a network of other places, such as the R-kiosks in Helsinki.\nThe same tickets may be valid for different kinds of transport, often with transfers included, such as any transfer within an hour or two. There may be different tickets depending on what mode of transport you want to use, whether you belong to some discount group (such as children) and what geographic zones you will be riding to or through (such as cheaper tickets for rides in the city center only).\nSometimes there are both lines operated by the city or regional council and independent lines, which may use the same tickets or their own. Regional trains may be part of the city's public transport system, the national railroad system or both.\nIn the simplest case, you pay the driver or a separate conductor by cash, app or card on boarding, or (where stops aren't too close one to another) a conductor collects the fees en route. In many cases though, the ticket must be bought beforehand, or is cheaper when bought beforehand. Day passes and other multi-use tickets are often not available on boarding, and are sometimes much cheaper than buying multiple single tickets. If you want to pay by app, you need to have that app installed: a general NFC payment one or an app for the specific ticketing system.\nFor underground lines, and sometimes for local trains, you may need a ticket already to be allowed to the platforms; there may be turnstiles as a barrier, or you may be treated as a stowaway if encountered without a valid ticket. Often, tickets can be bought in the area in front of the turnstiles.\nEspecially if tickets are valid for a certain time, allowing transfers, they may need to be validated at or before boarding the transport, or before entering the platform: the ticket must be tapped, swiped, or inserted into a machine to be valid (and perhaps for the turnstile to let you onto the platform). In some systems this validation needs to be done again on transfers, in other systems a new validation will deactivate the ticket or activate a new ride on a multi-use ticket. Single tickets may be automatically validated when issued.\nYour ticket's validity may be checked by the driver or conductor, perhaps by your showing it to a machine on boarding, or only by inspectors that turn up randomly. In the latter case there may be a hefty fee for riding without a valid ticket.\n\n\nGet out\nThere are also different ways to leave the system. Some systems require riders to tap or insert a card or ticket into a machine before leaving the system, too, while others put no impediment whatsoever in the path of departing commuters or simply require them to walk through a door or turnstile.\n\n\nWhat riders may carry\n\nThere are all sorts of different regulations as to what you may or may not carry into a train or bus and whether it does or does not incur an additional charge. Many transportation systems allow riders to carry bicycles with them onto the vehicle, at least outside of rush hours, for free or for an additional fee. In Berlin, for example, bicycles are welcome anytime but require a separate bicycle ticket, on penalty of a large fine. Dangerous objects may be more strictly regulated than in the street. Carrying a hamburger, an ice cream cone, or other potentially messy food on board is often forbidden \u2013 and seldom appreciated. Eating on board may be disallowed also otherwise.\nPublic transportation systems often have harsher rules of order than other public areas, usually banning alcoholic beverages, but this varies between different systems. Travelling with pets may be restricted: for example, some systems, such as New York's, require all pets to be brought in carriers, rather than merely leashed or hand-held, though small dogs that can fit in a handbag are OK as long as they stay there. In German cities such as Berlin, however, a single ticket is specifically noted to be good for one person and one dog (extra reduced-fare tickets are needed for additional dogs), and dogs need only be leashed. In some countries, dogs are required to wear muzzles on public transport. Regulations for service animals are quite often more liberal than regulations for pets.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nUrban rail\nSee Urban rail adventures for urban rail systems beyond the usual.\n\nThe oldest urban rail systems in the world (the London Underground, New York City Subway, Paris Metro, Berlin U-Bahn, Moscow Metro...) have many historical stations that are masterpieces of architecture and design in their own right. For example, Paris' famous Art Nouveau station entrances, London's Art Deco ticket halls and Moscow's cathedral-like platforms are seen as integral parts of their respective cities' heritage.\nSome rapid transit systems, such as Moscow and New York City have public art on permanent display, making them interesting destinations in their own right. See Stockholm Metro for a presentation.\nSome systems also display short poems or excerpts from longer poems and descriptive prose in train carriages, which was started by the London Tube as \"Poems on the Underground\", continued by the MTA as \"Poetry in Motion\" on New York's Subway and adopted by other mass transit systems around the world.\nRiding on systems with elevated lines can be a cheap and cheerful way of seeing the sights of a city from a good vantage point instead of forking out for a costly open-top bus or river tour. Notable examples include much of Chicago's L system, lines 2 and 6 of the Paris Metro and the Docklands Light Railway in east London.\nOne inherent advantage of light rail/trams over underground systems is the better views, and there are often routes that are worth taking for the views alone. One of the most notable examples of this is Melbourne tram route 35 (City Circle tram), which is a free tourist tram that does a full loop of the city.\n\n\nExpress trains\nMany express train routes run through spectacular countryside, including hills and beaches.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nPerformances\n\nSome rapid transit systems are well known for buskers or more formally organized performances. Among the systems where you can hear some high-quality performances by buskers in corridors are the London Tube and the Paris Metro.\nNew York City is one of the places where there is a formal system for selecting approved performers. Every year, there are auditions at Grand Central Terminal for Music Under New York, which gives artists a chance to perform on a regular schedule without hassles by the police, while they display the official logo of the program. The London Underground also has designated sites in prominent areas where licensed buskers can perform.\n\n\nStay safe\nTraveling via public transportation is a practical and economical way to navigate cities and towns. Unfortunately, there remains a slight risk of encountering criminal activities during your journey. Implementing simple precautions and staying alert can greatly reduce these risks and ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.\nFirstly, pay heed to your appearance and possessions. Blending in with locals and avoiding flashy clothing or accessories reduces the likelihood of drawing unnecessary attention from potential wrongdoers. Carrying only essential items and keeping them close to your person prevents losses due to pickpocketing or snatch-theft. Opt for front pants pockets, a purse kept firmly under your arm, or a concealed money belt to store valuable documents, electronics, and cash.\nSecondly, plan your route ahead of time and select well-populated carriages or sections of public transport vehicles. Sitting near other passengers or staff members tends to deter criminals looking for easy targets. Remain cautious when traveling alone late at night, choosing routes serviced by frequent departures and brightly illuminated stops. Trust your instincts and switch seats or exit the vehicle if someone makes you feel uncomfortable.\nThirdly, practice situational awareness while riding public transportation. Stay tuned in to announcements, observe fellow passengers' behaviors, and identify escape routes or emergency call buttons in case of sudden danger. Avoid deep conversations with strangers that may distract you from observing suspicious activities occurring around you. If confronted by an assailant, refrain from resisting physically unless absolutely necessary, as injuries can worsen the situation. Instead, prioritize verbal de-escalation techniques and cooperate until help arrives.\nAdditionally, take note of the condition and cleanliness of public transportation vehicles and stations. Poorly-maintained infrastructure may indicate lax security protocols, attracting criminal elements. Similarly, overflowing trash bins, broken fixtures, and dim lighting suggest neglected premises, increasing vulnerability to theft and violence. Report any such observations to the appropriate authorities and seek alternative modes of transportation if required.\nFinally, memorize emergency contacts and police hotline numbers specific to the region you are visiting. Save these digits on your phone or write them down on paper before embarking on your journey. Immediately notify law enforcement officials in case of witnessing or falling victim to robberies, assaults, or other serious crimes during your travels. Adhering to these guidelines can significantly decrease the chance of becoming involved in disturbing situations while utilizing public transportation systems.\n\n\nSecurity\nSecurity routines on stations and on board are usually harsher than in other public places. In high-risk areas, ticket gates might have metal detectors or body searches. Behavior accepted in the streets (drinking alcohol, begging, soliciting etc) might be prohibited in stations and vehicles. Staff might require ID from passengers, and forcefully eject (or even detain) passengers for intoxication, disorderly behavior, or for absence of a proper ticket.\n\n\nSpecific risks\nPickpocketing is common on public transportation. Follow the usual principles: Try to avoid displaying yourself as an out-of-town traveller, don't carry more baggage than you can keep track of, keep valuables near your body, and never put anything you don't want to lose in your back pants pockets or jacket pockets, only your front pants pockets or a money belt.\nAnother hazard of some rapid transit systems, especially in crowded trains, is molestation. It's to be expected that in very crowded systems during rush hour, people will be mashed against each other, but that is no excuse for someone to deliberately touch a stranger's private parts. Some rapid-transit systems, such as in Tokyo, Mexico City, Dubai and Delhi, have women-only areas. Others, like New York's, post and play announcements against molestation and advise victims not to remain silent. If you are being molested in a crowded metro car, speak up, and the rest of the passengers will generally support you.\nAn obvious danger is falling onto the tracks. These (or a third rail on the side) are often electrified, so touching them can be fatal. Additionally, being struck by a train is also likely considering the high frequency of services. If you accidentally drop anything onto the tracks, inform the station staff and make no attempt to retrieve the item yourself, no matter how valuable it is.\nMany rapid transport systems have installed automatic doors between the platform and the tracks, such as in Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong or Singapore. This is done for general safety and also to prevent suicides. However, do not be surprised if some stations on a network lack such doors.\nGenerally speaking, if you get stuck in a train door owing to a crowded compartment, the train will not move and will open the door again. However, there have been cases, such as in Shanghai, when people have died after the train started to move whilst they were caught in the door, so you should not rely on such safety measures. This is especially important if you travel with children, whose limbs may be too thin to be detected by the system. In buses, the driver's view may be obstructed by the crowd so that a child is hard to see.\nCrowding is a risk factor for all of the above. So if you have the chance, do yourself and everyone else a favor and avoid rides during rush hour (usually 07:00-09:00 and 16:00-18:00 on weekdays and for major public events), or wait for a less crowded train.\nThe crowds on public transport create a risk for infectious diseases to spread through aerosols or physical contact. This has long been a concern in many countries in Asia, and became an international risk factor during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\nShutdowns\nShutdowns can be done for various reasons: renovation, security incidents, crashes, strikes, or severe weather. If you have time, read the local news, or the carrier's website, to learn about disruptions.\nPlanned shutdowns (usually for renovation) tend to have better information and replacement service than the unplanned ones.\nIn the best case, a closed rail line can be replaced by buses, which tend to be more irregular, crowded and time-consuming than the regular service.\n\n\nRespect\nSee also: Respect#Public transport\nEtiquette for public transit systems varies from system to system. For instance, in non-pandemic times, while eating on the train is acceptable in London as long as you are not making a mess, consumption of food is prohibited on public transport in Hong Kong. Likewise, while it is common for people to talk on the phone in Chicago, talking on the phone is prohibited while on trains in Tokyo. Where phone calls are allowed, don't talk loudly on the phone.\nShow consideration for your fellow passengers: don't block aisles or take up multiple seats. Don't listen to loud music, and if at any point you realise you don't know what to do or where to go, get out of the way of those who do.\nAble-bodied travellers should give up their seats for travellers who are elderly, pregnant, having a motion disability, or otherwise in need of rest. Some seats might be marked as \"priority seats\" for those with special needs, with text or pictograms.\n\n\nArticles on public transit systems\nSome large cities and countries have complex transportation systems described in a whole article.\n\nTrams in Melbourne\nBay Area public transit (San Francisco area)\nPublic transit in Israel\nPublic transport in Greater Kolkata\nPublic transport in Stockholm County\nPublic transport in Sydney\nSee Rail travel for articles on rail travel by country\n\n\nMuseums covering urban rail\n\n1 Cable Car Museum (Nob Hill, San Francisco).   \n2 Glasgow Riverside Museum (Glasgow, Scotland), \u260f +44 141 287-2720.
