  "extract": "Antwerp (Dutch: Antwerpen, French: Anvers) is the capital of the eponymous province in the region of Flanders in Belgium. At a population of just over half a million people (2018), it is the second largest city in Belgium (after Brussels), and it has a major European port. Due to its long and culturally rich history, the city of Antwerp houses many interesting historical buildings from different historical periods, and many interesting museums. Antwerp is also known as the global diamond trade hub: more than 70% of all diamonds are traded in Antwerp.\nAntwerp has grown to become a trendy city, attracting many Flemish and foreign artists, writers, intellectuals, and actors. This is reflected in the city's many trendy bars and shops. Antwerp is a city with many faces. While it may not be as historically preserved as Bruges or Ghent, it is a very dynamic city, offering a perfect mix of history and present-day modern life. The friendliness of the people of Antwerp and their innate penchant for good food and good living, combined with their low stress lifestyle, makes it a desirable and relaxing place to visit.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe origins of the name of Antwerp comes from aan de werpe, which is Dutch for \"at the throw\", referring to where the river throws its sand. The name also has a funny anecdote saying it comes from Hand werpen, which translated is \"throwing hands\". In the city flag, the castle \"het Steen\" and the hand of Antwerp are shown.\nIn the 16th century, Antwerp was one of the most important financial centres of the world, where traders from all over Europe and Asia sold and bought their goods. After the siege of Antwerp in 1585 by the Spanish, this role as a financial centre was taken over by Amsterdam. Nevertheless, since the 19th century and especially the 20th century, Antwerp has made a serious economic comeback.\n\nVisit Antwerp tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Antwerp Airport (ANR  IATA). A small airport catering mostly to leisure travellers. There are some regular, but mostly seasonal flights to various popular holiday destinations in Southern Europe, Morocco and Turkey, as well as private and chartered (business) aviation. The flip side of the small size of the airport is that arrival and departure procedures are very quick compared to large hubs. There is a regular bus from the airport to the centre and a taxi costs around \u20ac10.   \nBrussels Airport (BRU IATA)\nHourly direct trains link Antwerpen Centraal station with this airport in 25 minutes (45 minutes on weekends and public holidays). Single adult tickets are \u20ac11.30.\nThere is also a direct bus between Brussels Airport and Antwerp which costs \u20ac10 and has two stops in Antwerp at Hotel Crowne Plaza and in the city centre, at Franklin Rooseveltplaats at platform B5. A schedule can be found here\n\nAmsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS IATA) has a high-speed train station on the Amsterdam-Brussels line directly underneath the terminal, which allows for two different railway connections to Antwerp:\nThere is a regular intercity train Amsterdam \u2014 Brussels that connects Schiphol Airport directly with Antwerpen Centraal station in approximately 1 hr 50 min. You can buy tickets with credit card at the automatic ticket booths in the Schiphol arrival hall. Payment with cash is also possible at the counter. Or you can book through Belgian Railways (SNCB/NMBS) or NS International. A single ticket costs about \u20ac25.\nA second option is the bright red high-speed Eurostar train Amsterdam - Paris, which stops at Schiphol and Antwerpen Centraal station, in about half the time it takes the regular train, but at double the price. Contrary to regular trains, reservations on Eurostar are required. Best reserve your seat a week or so beforehand, since buying a ticket on the spot will turn out to be even more expensive. The Eurostar journey from Schiphol to Antwerpen Centraal can also be booked as a part of a SkyTeam flight (IATA code for Antwerpen Centraal is ZWE  IATA), usually costing less than when booking the flight and the Eurostar ride separately.\nKLM also maintains a direct shuttle bus connection between Antwerpen Centraal and Schiphol Airport, which can be booked as a KLM flight segment under the code KL320/KL321. The bus takes 2\u00bd hr to get between Antwerp and Schiphol, but there is usually no difference in price between flight tickets using the bus and the Eurostar, so book carefully.\n\n\nBy train\n\nBelgium has an extensive rail network, and for intercity travel within Belgium, trains are always the best option. Tickets can be bought on the website of the Belgian railways and at the ticket counters in most stations. There are good train connections to and from Brussels Airport and Schiphol airport in Amsterdam. To plan your trip, you can consult the website of NMBS (SNCB) for national and international travels. If you cross multiple borders, it is often possible to book your entire trip at once through Deutsche Bahn.\n\n2 Antwerp-Central station (ZWE  IATA). The monumental main train station of Antwerp, with a triple-level layout.Platforms with single-digit numbers are on the upper level.Platforms with numbers starting with 1 are on the middle level.Platforms with numbers starting with 2 are on the lowest level of the building. All trains to & from the Netherlands use these platforms.   (updated Oct 2021)\n3 Antwerp-Berchem station (Antwerpen-Berchem). Secondary train station that can come in handy if you want to start your visit in southern districts of Antwerp. With the exception of high-speed trains and the Dutch-run Intercity Direct service, nearly all trains stop in Berchem.   (updated Oct 2021)\nAntwerp-Central is a major stop on the Paris-Amsterdam high-speed line. International trains from France and the Netherlands stop in Antwerp-Central station only, and not in Antwerp-Berchem anymore. The same train services that call at Schiphol Airport also call at Amsterdam Centraal and Rotterdam Centraal. Tickets for train journeys originating from the Netherlands are bookable through Belgian Railways (NMBS/SNCB), Eurostar, or NS International but remember that some tickets (especially Eurostar tickets) are valid only on specific trains. Passengers coming from the UK via Eurostar can transfer at Brussel-Zuid to any regular NMBS-operated train bound for Antwerp provided that at the time of booking, Antwerp was selected as the final destination. Through Brussel-Zuid railway station, there are also high-speed connections to other destinations in France with TGV, or destinations in Germany with ICE. If you have a mobile device, the SNCB (Belgian Railways) App (in English) is useful and also shows you how to get to the station.\n\n\nBy bus\nSeveral bus operators offer long-distance connections to Antwerp:\n\n Flixbus. A German company with a network throughout most of Europe. Offers services to numerous German destinations, Paris, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and London.  (updated Aug 2016)\n Ecolines, \u260f +371 67214512. Offers bus travel from many countries, usually Central and Eastern European, to Antwerp. In Antwerp they have an office on the Berchem station square.   \n De Lijn, \u260f +32 70 220-200. The Flemish region (Dutch-speaking) public bus service.   (updated Sep 2016)\n\n\nBy car\nThe overall city centre of Antwerp is a low-emission zone and foreign vehicles require registration which should generally be made before entering and can exceptionally be made up to one day after the first move into the city. You will need your registration details and potentially car documents; depending on the age of the car you will need exception permits which are \u20ac35 per day (valid until 06:00 next morning). For more information see the information by the relevant authorities here. Driving into the (video surveilled) LEZ without registration is subject to fine ranging from \u20ac150 to \u20ac350.\nMany streets in the centre are narrow and driving there is slow and rather uncomfortable anyway. The Ring road around Antwerp is often congested. Works at the Oosterweellink are in progress since 2021, some exits are closed till 2030.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nFrom Brussels: exit Brussels towards the north via the Havenlaan and the Willebroek Canal bike route, up to the tall iron Buda Bridge. Cross the canal and continue on the other side through the town of Vilvoorde, until you reach the river Zenne. The F1 cycle superhighway (Fietssnelweg) continues towards Mechelen along the Zenne. Past Mechelen, the F1 runs along the Antwerp-Brussels railway and terminates at Antwerp-Central Station. Total distance from Brussels to Antwerp is around 50 km.\nFrom Ghent: the F4 cycle superhighway (55 km) starts at Gent-Dampoort railway station. The first part runs on ordinary roads, but once in the countryside outside of Ghent, it runs on a dedicated bike lane along the Antwerp-Ghent railway. It passes through Lokeren and Sint-Niklaas, the capital of the Waasland (the region between Antwerp and Ghent). For the time being, the F4 terminates at Zwijndrecht railway station, 4 km short of Antwerp. From there, follow the street and path towards the Blancefloerlaan, which has good bike lanes and leads straight to the St.-Anna Pedestrian Tunnel on the Antwerp Left Bank - with its quaint historic wooden escalators, through which you can cycle underneath the river Schelde into central Antwerp.\nFrom the seaside: the nearest town on the Belgian coast is Knokke-Heist (100 km), although some towns on the Dutch coast (Cadzand at 90 km and Breskens at 75 km) are even closer to Antwerp. Anyway, the shortest, most scenic and most comfortable bike route to Antwerp passes partly through the Netherlands (Zeelandic Flanders). From Knokke, a fabulous bicycle path runs around the Zwin nature reserve at the NL border, continuing along the Dutch seaside via Cadzand towards Breskens. The bike path runs right on top of the dunes, with great views over the beach and sea on your one side and the polders on your other. Past Breskens, the bike lane leaves the North Sea and continues along the Westerschelde, which is over 5 km wide at this point. Once you reach the industries around the port of Terneuzen, following the river becomes impossible, so you have to turn inland and continue to and through Terneuzen. From Terneuzen, follow ordinary roads with good Dutch bike lanes to Hulst. From Hulst, take the former railway bike path (F411 cycle superhighway) to Sint-Niklaas. From Sint-Niklaas, follow the F4 to Antwerp as described above.\nFrom NL/Holland: from wherever you are in Holland (e.g. Amsterdam, Rotterdam), first make your way south to the border town of Roosendaal. Continue for another 10 km south to the Belgian border town of Essen. From there, the F14 cycle superhighway gets you to Antwerp in no time, running along the old Antwerp-Amsterdam railway. It terminates at Luchtbal, from where you can complete the last few kilometres into central Antwerp on ordinary roads. From more eastern parts of the Netherlands, it will be shorter to travel via Tilburg (NL), starting point of the 'Bels Lijntje' \u2014 a 30-km disused railway bike trail through the curious Belgian exclave Baarle-Hertog \u2014 to Turnhout (B), from where you can follow the F15 cycle superhighway along the canal to Antwerp.\nFrom Germany: the nearest German city is Aachen (143 km), right next to the border tripoint of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. From Aachen, cross into the Netherlands at Vaals and continue to Maastricht. Cross Maastricht towards the west and cross into Belgium at Lanaken, where you reach the Albert Canal. From this point, a cycle superhighway runs along the Albert Canal all the way to Antwerp, through the Belgian Limburg and the Kempen (the region east of Antwerp). It is numbered as the F72 until Hasselt, then as the F5 Hasselt-Antwerpen.\nFrom Luxemburg: follow the award-winning Vennbahn bike path, one of the longest bicycle trails on disused railway tracks in Europe (125 km). Starting in northern Luxemburg, it leads through East Belgium, the German-speaking and highest part of the country (it actually snows there in winter). After a long descent through forested hills, the Vennbahn terminates in Aachen, Germany. From there, continue to Antwerp as described above.\nFrom Wallonia: from Charleroi, follow the Ravel bike lane along the Brussels-Charleroi Canal to and through Brussels until you reach the F1 to Antwerp. From Li\u00e8ge, follow the Ravel bike lane along the river Meuse and Albert Canal, until you reach the F72 and F5 to Antwerp.\nFrom France: France is not so bicycle-friendly; (intercity) bike lanes are almost non-existent. If you really must travel from France by bicycle, the nearest major French city is Lille. From there, make your way to Kortrijk in Belgium, from where the F7 cycle superhighway (still partly under construction) gets you to Ghent. From there, follow the F4 as described above to reach Antwerp.\nFrom the United Kingdom: take your bike on the ferry from Dover to Dunkerque (France, 20 km from the Belgian border, from the ferry port is actually over 30 km) and follow the coastal road from there until you reach De Panne (Belgium). Continue along the Belgian coast until Knokke and continue to Antwerp as described above, or (shorter) cut through via Diksmuide towards Deinze, then F7 to Ghent followed by F4 to Antwerp.\n\n\nGet around\n\n \n\n\nBy public transportation\n\nThe public transportation company De Lijn has a dense network of buses, trams, and pre-metro (underground tram) connections in the city and wide area around it. Tickets can be purchased through the mobile app. You can also buy cards of \u20ac17 (10 fares) or alternatively 1- or 3-day tickets at fixed points in town; inside transportation payment of tickets is only possible via contactless payment (cards or via smartphone); buying tickets in cash is not possible anymore.  For one fare, you can ride up to an hour.\nThe tram system operates with low-floor articulated units (refer to the above photo), mostly in tunnels under the centre, & older high-floor tramcars, mostly on ground-level routes.\nThe central bus station is the Franklin Roosevelt plaats, near the central train station. Most buses leave from there or from the train station. Maps of the bus/tram network in the entire region can be found in PDF format here .\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis are available, but they can be quite expensive. They await customers at specific locations around town (waving your hand will seldom work) like the Groenplaats or the railway station. You can recognize these places by an orange TAXI sign. The prices are fixed in the taximeter.\nMabo Taxi Antwerpen provides taxi rides in Antwerp for those who wish to avoid public transportation.\n\n\nBy car\nDriving in Antwerp is not as difficult as many big cities in the world, but crossroads can seem very chaotic for foreigners. There are few free parking spaces, but many spaces where you have to pay (on the street or in underground car parks). The underground car parks are well-signposted. The prices are typically \u20ac2 to \u20ac4.80 per hour, depending on the area. As of August 2023, parking on the streets is only allowed for residents and permit holders; visitors have to park in a car park downtown, or at one of the 9 park-and-rides (\u20ac1) at the border of the city, with connections on public transport to the centre.\nThere are many one-way roads, that can make it difficult to get to a specific place. Try to park your car as close as possible and go on foot.\nAntwerp has introduced a Low Emission Zone, which applies to domestic and foreign registered cars. The latter have to jump through hoops to demonstrate their emission status. The zone seems to be inside but excluding the ring-road, but the official map is dreadful, so beware.\n\n\nBy bicycle\n\nThe city has many special paths for cyclists. Most one-way roads can be accessed both ways. Make sure to lock your bike to a fixed object, however, or it will be stolen! Around town there are a few places that are specially prepared for hosting bicycles for free, like at the Groenplaats.\nAntwerp's bike-sharing scheme is called Velo. You can get a day pass for these bikes in the Central Station and pick up your bike at more than 80 places in Antwerp. The first 15 minutes are free, then the price gradually increases. Bicycles can also be rented at several places in town like Ligfiets, Windroos, Fietsdokter (verschransingsstraat), or Fietshaven (government initiative, under the central station).\n\n\nBy kick scooter\nShared electric kick scooters that can be used in combination with an app, are available from 3 operators: Bird, Lime and Poppy. Minimum age is 16, some areas are no go, no park or low-speed zones (8 km/h). Follow the same traffic rules as cyclists and drop the scooter after use in a drop-off zone or at a convenient spot. \n\n\nOn foot\nMost things to see are near or within the Boulevards, the half-moon of avenues where there were once 16th-century city walls. This old town centre, with a diameter of about 1.5 km, can be walked, and there is also excellent public transport. The centre is densely signposted to aid those discovering it on foot [1].\n\n\nBy horse tram\nA \"Horse tram\" (i.e. a horse and carriage) leaves from the Grote Markt every hour. It is an approximately 40-minute/2.5-km ride through the city.\n\n\nSee\n Antwerp City Pass. With the Antwerp City Card you can visit all museums and three monumental churches over a 48-hour period. It also features a 25% discount on attractions, sightseeing and bicycle rentals. In the free guide you find vouchers that you can use to enjoy benefits on typical Antwerp and Belgian products including chocolate and chips. \u20ac45/\u20ac55/\u20ac65. (updated May 2023)\n\n\nCentre\n\n1 City Hall/Old Market Square (Stadhuis/Grote Markt). This is the historical centre of town. The market square is surrounded by the typical medieval guild houses you find in most Flemish historical towns. The city hall is designed in special architectural style with a combination between Gothic and early Renaissance, and is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. This style is almost exclusively found in this region of Europe. The Brabo Fountain (Dutch: Brabofontein) is located in front of the city hall. Restaurants with terraces surround the square. During winter the Grote Markt is decorated with Christmas lights and a large Christmas tree. Several events take place at this location. Nice view of the cathedral. (updated Apr 2023)\n\n2 Diamond District. This is south and southwest of the central station. You will find countless jewellery shops, as well as the Antwerp Diamond Exchange, one of the most important financial centres of the world's diamond industry. The district is interesting from an ethnic and cultural perspective, for at least 50% of the diamond industry is in the hands of the city's Jews. Antwerp has a large population of Jews (about 50,000 people), a lot of them Orthodox.   (updated Dec 2022)\n3 The hidden street Vlaeykensgang. Connects Hoogstraat, Oude Koornmarkt and Pelgrimsstraat. It is a real street, but only accessible through unassuming medieval front doors in the streets. The medieval equivalent of a gated community. It now houses nice, informal restaurants and chic, discrete houses. A must see!  \n Jewish Quarter (Joodse wijk). One of the main Jewish centres in the world, with the beautiful 'Van Den Nest' and 'Bouwmeester' synagogues. Contact the Jewish community for a guide. \n4 Bouwmeester synagogue, Bouwmeestersstraat 7 (close to the \"Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp\"). (updated Oct 2021)\n5 Romi Goldmuntz Synagogue (Van Den Nest synagogue), Oostenstraat 2 (corner Van Den Nestlei), \u260f +32 3 232 01 87. The main synagogue of Antwerp. (updated Oct 2021)\n6 Antwerp Ruien. You can take a guided tour of the underground city of Antwerp. 90 minutes. Free with City Card. \u20ac19.  (updated Dec 2022)\n Red light district. Like cities such as Amsterdam and Hamburg, Antwerp has a red light district. If you want to visit, consider going during the day. When Villa Tinto set up, Antwerp's little red light district became Europe's most high tech brothel. If you intend to be a patron of the district, be wary of women who beckon you to their kamers and invite you in without discussing a price. In many cases, these women will charge a greatly inflated rate once they have you inside their kamer. Even if you have no intention of partaking in the festivities, it is worthwhile just to see the spectacle that the district is. 200 women all in their own window dressed for action. Be wary of beggars in the Red Light District: while few of them are particularly hostile, they can be bothersome and should be ignored. There is very little illegal activity as there is a constant police presence, which you can expect to see. \n\n\nMuseums and galleries\n\n7 Plantin Moretus Museum, Vrijdagmarkt 22, \u260f +32 3 221 1450, +32 3 221 1451.

Adults \u20ac12.   (updated Jun 2023)\n8 Vleeshuis. Literally, the \"Meat house\". It was built as the guild hall for the butchers. Every day tonnes of meat changed owners here. The building is famous for the original masonry made to resemble stacks of bacon (switching between white stones and red bricks). It now houses a museum, of which the main part comprises a musical instrument collection, including some examples of old harpsichords built by the local Ruckers family.   \n\n9 Mineralogical Museum (Museum van de Academie voor Mineralogie, ACAM), Frans de l\u2019Arbrelaan 12 (take tram 6 direction Luchtbal and get off at Gasthuishoeve), \u260f +32 3 658 62 83, info@acam.be.

Tu-Su 10:00-17:00; closed on M. This museum opened in 2013 and displays the history of the Red Star Line, a Belgian navigation company offering connections between Antwerp and New York. This enabled large-scale emigration to the United States. The museum collection is based on the stories of people who travelled on this line, including Albert Einstein and Irving Berlin. \u20ac8 regular, \u20ac6 reduced, free for children under 12.  \n12 Extra City Kunsthal, Eikelstraat 25. ECK is an art space for contemporary visual arts, based in an old bottling factory. Its shows are mostly experimental, but always intriguing.  (updated Dec 2022)\n13 Vlaams Tram- en Autobusmuseum (Flemish Tram and Bus Museum), Diksmuidelaan 42 (tram 4 or 9 to Berchem Groenenhoek tram stop). mid-Apr to mid-Oct: Sa Su 13:00-16:30.

One of the most impressive and largest Gothic cathedrals in Northern Europe, built in 1351 it stands over 400 ft tall. It also houses some of Rubens' most famous paintings.   (updated Dec 2022)\n16 Saint Paul's Church (Sint-Pauluskerk). A beautiful mixed gothic and baroque church formerly part of a nunnery. Noted for its Calvary monument. It is a short distance north of the Grote Maarkt on Zwartzustersstraat. \n17 Carolus Borromeus Church. Unlike the cathedral, this is a Baroque church. With a safe and minimal exterior, you would not know the beautiful decorations (done by Rubens' studio) are inside. It is on the picturesque square Conscienceplein.   (updated Dec 2022)\n\n\nAnimal interest\n18 Antwerp Zoo. One of the oldest zoos in the world, with over 4000 animals and lots of 19th-century design and architecture.   \n\n\nOther buildings of note\n\n19 The Begijnhof (beguinage). A sort of medieval monastery for women. The well-kept gardens are great photo opportunities.  \n20 Boerentoren (Farmers' Tower). Now called KBC Tower after the company that owns it, this 97-m skyscraper in the historical centre of town is said to be the oldest one on the European continent. It was built between 1929 and 1932. It is at the end of the Meir shopping street. The tower is renowned for its typical art-deco sculptures. It is not a skyscraper on the same scale as some that were erected in North America; for example the Empire State Building in New York, built at the same time, is 381 m. \n21 Bourla Theatre (Bourlaschouwburg). 19th-century neo-classicist theatre building. Charming from the outside and even nicer if you manage to get in for a theater show or a concert. It houses a spectacular pastry salon inside the large cupola above the theatre. Great place to have tea with cake or waffles, of course.   (updated Dec 2022)\nCentral Station is worth a look even if you're not travelling by train. In 2014, the British-American magazine Mashable has chosen Antwerpen-Centraal to be the most beautiful railway station in the world.\n22 Het Steen (The Stone), Steenplein 1. Daily 10:00-18:00. Closing days: 25 December and 1 January. This is a rather small medieval castle on the banks of the river Schelde. It used to function as a city fortification and housed a naval museum. The Visitor Center and attraction The Antwerp Story are located here since 2021. There is a panoramic terrace and the starting point of the Wandelterrassen, a scenic boardwalk.   (updated Apr 2023)\n23 Rubenshuis, Wapper 9-11, \u260f +32 3 201 1555. M Tu Th F 10:00-17:00, Sa Su 10:00-18:00. The house of painter Peter Paul Rubens is now a museum of his life and artwork.

(updated May 2024)\n\n\nSouth of Antwerp\n\nSince the restoration a couple of years ago, the south of the city is known as the trendy part.\nThe centre of this piece of the city is a huge square called de gedempte zuiderdokken which simply means, 'the filled-up southern docks'. In the 1960s, this was an abandoned trade dock. They filled up the dock in an attempt to expand the city. The high crime rate in the region made it a very cheap place to live. This was a blessing for the local art world, which started to flourish, making the region trendy and safe over the years. Today, it is known as a \"yuppie stronghold\".\n\n24 M HKA, Leuvenstraat 32, \u260f +32 3 260 99 99, info@muhka.be. Museum of contemporary art. \u20ac14 full, \u20ac8 reduced.

(updated Jun 2023)\n26 Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Royal Museum of Fine Arts), Leopold de Waelplaats, \u260f +32 3 238 7809. Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten boasts an excellent collection of paintings from the 15th century to the 20th century. The museum's permanent collection has masters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Brueghel, Van Eyck, Anthony Van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and James Ensor. It displays the largest James Ensor collection in the world. The KMSKA has been closed for major reconstruction works for 11 years, reopening in September 2022. The building has been expanded with a new white hall dedicated to modern art.   (updated Apr 2023)\n27 Zuiderpershuis, \u260f +32 3 248 7077. It is on the Waalse Kaai and is a centre for intercultural art. It used to be a hydraulic power station.  (updated Apr 2023)\n Het Muntplein. A place where graffiti artists can make artwork without being chased by police. There are often very nice creations. Graffiti contests occur on a regular basis. \n28 Palace of Justice (Justitiepaleis). There are actually two of these. The old one is a 19th-century red brick building on the Britselei. The new one is a dominant, modern, white building in the south of Antwerp (Bolivarplaats). You can hardly miss it once you're there. The architect of this building was Richard Rogers, who also built the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Millennium Dome in London. \n29 Zurenborg neighborhood. A little off the beaten track. This neighbourhood in the south east of Antwerp (near the railway station Antwerpen-Berchem, look for 'Cogels-Osylei' on the map) is known for its eclectic, sometimes rather bizarre 19th-century architecture. Consider taking a tram or bicycle to get there.   \n30 Middelheim Park and Middelheim Museum, Middelheimlaan, Wilrijk. The centre of Antwerp is not very big, and once you cross the ring road, you will mainly see suburbs. There are some nice parks outside the ring road: the Middelheim Park in Wilrijk is one of them.

Take St. Anna pedestrian tunnel (Sint-Annatunnel) to the Left Bank (Linkeroever) of the river Schelde. If possible, you should descend on the original wooden escalator. The walk through the tunnel takes 9 minutes at a casual pace. On the Left Bank, you have a beautiful view over the city centre across the river, so make sure you bring your camera! The Left Bank is very quiet compared to the city centre, and green with many parks along the riverside. A few km further north, there even is a small beach (Sint-Annastrand). Swimming is prohibited due to dangerous currents and heavy ship traffic, but the views over the city and riverbend are great. Best is to come here by bicycle (you can ride through the tunnel, many locals do this). If you are on foot and don't feel like walking back through the tunnel, the premetro will take you back to Groenplaats in under 5 minutes.  (updated Dec 2015)\n Pelgrom, \u260f +32 3 234 0809. This building combines both an impressive bar in the basement, plus the 'poortershuis', which is a replica of the house of businessmen in Antwerp during the 17th century. \nAntwerp by Bike \u2014 Discover Antwerp with a bike. The inner city is perhaps too crowded, but the green outskirts are really worth visiting. For bike rental, see [2] and \"V\u00e9lo\". \"Antwerp by Bike\" [3] has a charming tour with all the highlights of Antwerp, like the cathedral, the Butterfly Palace and the MAS museum (from July till September). For other tours, see [4]\n Baja Bikes (Bike Tours Antwerp). Antwerp is a perfect city to explore by bike. An English or Dutch guide will show you around and tell you all about the city. Besides that the guide knows where to go in Antwerp and can recommend you nice bars and restaurants. It is possible to do a highlights tour or book a private tour so that you will have your own guide. (updated Dec 2015)\n2 Kinepolis Antwerpen, Groenendaallaan 394, \u260f +32 3 544 36 00.

A great festival that takes places throughout the city for the whole summer. Cheap or free activities such as dancing, theater, performances, circus and outdoor movies are organised. Reservations are often a must, especially for free activities. (date needs fixing)\n\n\nBuy\n\nThe main shopping area is the Meir, a street that stretches out from the Keyserlei (close to the central station) to the Groenplaats. It is one of the most famous shopping streets in Belgium. Don't forget to visit the mall Stadsfeestzaal (between Meir and Hopland), which was beautifully restored and reopened in 2007 after it was partially destroyed by a fire ten years earlier. You will see a lot of gold on the ceiling, and all sorts of stores. The streets Hopland and Schuttershofstraat are the shopping terrain of the rich and famous with exclusive fashion shops like Cartier, Hermes, Scapa, and Armani. The Huidevettersstraat, Nationalestraat, and Kammenstraat (all close to the Meir) are also very interesting shopping streets to visit.\n\nPurchasing a diamond at one of the many tourist jewelry shops around the Central station can be an unpleasant experience. Like any big diamond city in the world, there are many tourist trap diamond shops around the actual diamond district centre, though it is fair to say that if you are prepared to bargain you can purchase jewellery here for significantly less than in countries such as the UK. Wealthy diamond buyers should do their investigative shopping online prior to visiting Antwerp. For tips on buying diamond rings, see Diamond rings in Antwerp. If you're less wealthy and someone asks you to bring back some diamonds from Antwerp, buy diamond-shaped chocolate pralines at e.g. Burie (Korte Gasthuisstraat 3), Ch\u00e2teau Blanc [5] (Torfbrug 1) or Del Rey (Appelmansstraat 5).\nTrendy shopping can be done in the Kammenstraat and surroundings. In this area, you will also find the Fashion Museum [6] and many shops of famous Antwerp fashion designers, such as Walter van Beirendonck and Dries van Noten.\nThe Kloosterstraat has many antique shops, with often bizarre items for sale.\nChinatown can be found about 300 m north of the Central Station (see also Eat). A lot of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese products can be found here.\nWeekend Markets take place on the Theaterplein Square (follow Wapper or Meistraat south from the Meir) in front of the Stadsschouwburg theatre. The markets are very popular with stalls offering everything from food (fruit and veg, meat, fish, nuts, cheese ethnic specialities) to household goods to bicycles to antiques to clothes. Sunday tends to see a lot more stalls compared to Saturday. Take a break from browsing at the stall at the centre of the square, where you can buy a cheese roll with a glass of chilled cava to wash it down, most convivial!\nAt Ploegstraat 25 you can find a \"give-away shop\", where you can bring and take stuff as you please without any monetary interaction. Open M-F 14:00-18:00.\n\n\nLearn\n\nAntwerp has several colleges and a university.\n\nUniversity of Antwerp.\nArtesis (formerly Hogeschool Antwerpen).\nKU Leuven campus Carolus and Sint-Andries (formerly Lessius Hogeschool).\nKarel de Grote Hogeschool.\nAntwerp Maritime Academy.\nDue to very strict language requirements imposed by the Flemish government, all Bachelor courses are offered in Dutch only (except for the Maritime Academy which enjoys a special international status). However, the University of Antwerp offers 9 fully English-taught Master programmes, 7 advanced Master programmes, and 7 postgraduate degrees, in topics ranging from Linguistics and Computer Science to Marine Transport [7].\nAntwerp hosts over 30,000 students, and therefore boasts a vibrant student life that also has many traditional aspects. Well-connected in the centre of Europe, offering a varied city day- and nightlife, and having a very reasonable cost of living compared to the surrounding capitals, it's a popular destination for Erasmus students. Current and prospective Erasmus students should get in touch with ESN Antwerp, part of the global Erasmus Student Network and very active in organizing activities to help international students find their way around.\n\n\nEat\n\nAntwerpse handjes are little biscuits or chocolates in the shape of a hand. Invented by a Jewish baker in 1932. \nAs with most Flemish towns, you can find many frietkoten in the city. These are places of which the Belgians are really proud of. Here you can buy the famous Belgian fries and other fried food for a reasonable price.\nFor lunch people often go eat a \"smos\", a sandwich with several layers of garniture in it. The name refers to the mess you make when trying to eat it. You can find them in several stores like Panos or Foodmaker.\nDe Keyserlei (the street that runs west from Central Station) is a street with a varied choice of restaurants. The side streets on the north side of De Keyserlei offer even more options, with Lebanese, South-African, Mexican, Italian and Vietnamese (to name but a few) restaurants all rubbing shoulders with each other. With so many restaurants in a small area the prices tend to be pretty competitive.\nChinatown takes up a couple of streets on the north side of Koningin-Astrid-plein (the large square to the north of Central Station). Look for the 2 lions guarding the entrance to Van Wesenbekestraat. Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and Nepalese restaurants are here as well as lots of Chinese options. \n\n\nBudget\nBroodje/Boterkoken (sandwiches) are local and inexpensive.\n\n1 Aahaar (Vegetarian Indian Cuisine), Lange Herentalsestraat 23 (Minutes from Antwerp's main train station Central Station), \u260f +32 3 226 00 52.

(updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nDrink\nWherever you are in Antwerp, you will always be near a pub or another drinking facility. Not surprising in the city that has the most pubs per capita in the world. The pubs do not have a closing hour.\nDrinks originating here are De Koninck (commonly called \"Bolleke\") beer, and Elixir d'Anvers \u2013 a liquor based on plants.\n\nDen Engel \u2014 Most famous traditional cafe in Antwerp. Situated at Grote Markt.\nDe Vagant \u2014 A famous Belgian cafe serving about 300 kinds of Jenever.\nDe Muze \u2014 A jazz caf\u00e9 in Melkmarkt.

They have very nice specialized coffee creations and a cozy outdoor with lots of green. Good music. Say hi from \"TheKitt\" for a special, double shot cappuccino.\n1 Kulminator, Vleminckveld 32. Kind of off the beaten path, this bar has a neat hole in the wall atmosphere and an amazing selection of beer, (around 700 beers, with 200-300 aged over 10 years) ranging from expensive to about average. All in all, a great time, and a great value. \nPaeters Vaetje, (in the Cathedral Square). Here you can order more than 100 kinds of beer. In summertime, you can also sit outside.\n Pelgrom, Pelgrimsstraat 15, \u260f +32 3 234 0809.

The name is absolutely correct: the Best Western is in the docklands area. The hotel could use an update to contemporary standards, but can be cheaper than more central hotels. \n3 Crowne Plaza Antwerpen (at the intersection of the R1, A1 and A12 highways, on the outskirts of the city). It can be inexpensive for a hotel of its class, but it comes at the expense of the less-than-handy location and rather aged decor in the cheapest rooms. On the flip side, the large pool with artsy decorations and forest vistas is a treat. from \u20ac70. \n4 Holiday Inn Express Antwerpen City North, Itali\u00eblei 2, 2000 Antwerpen. The hotel faces one of the port basins in the docklands area in the north of Antwerp, offering a view of the Museum aan de Stroom from some of its rooms. Despite the modern facade, the hotel was built to the brand's previous standards, so it may not be comparable to newer HIExpress properties in terms of furniture and fitouts, but all hotels in the chain it offers free breakfast and WiFi included in the room rate. \u20ac97. \n5 Ibis Hotel Antwerpen Centrum (good location in the city centre, near the Stadschouwburg theatre and the Vogeltjesmarkt), \u260f +32 3 2318830. While the room rates tend to be low, the breakfast in the hotel tends not to be, but there are plenty of cafes in the immediate area and a market on the Theaterplein square in front of the hotel Saturday and Sunday mornings. If you're a very light sleeper try to get a room on the side that doesn't face onto the Theaterplein as the market traders start setting up pretty early!. \n6 Hotel Indigo Antwerpen (Queen A Antwerpen), Koningin Astridplein 43 (Astridplein is right in front of Antwerpen Centraal railway station), \u260f +32 33 69 59 99, toll-free: +1 877 660 8550, info@indigoantwerp.com. Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 11:00. Relatively small rooms with trendy decor. The breakfast is too expensive; go to Caf\u00e9 Jozef next door instead. From \u20ac80. (updated Jul 2024)\n7 Quality Hotel Antwerpen Centrum Opera, Molenbergstraat 9, \u260f +32 32 32 76 75. This hotel is on a side street, a reasonable distance from the central train station. It may not be easy to find, so look for the huge sign atop the corner building. From \u20ac85. \n8 Novotel Antwerpen, Luithagen - Haven 6. This is an old-style low-rise suburban Novotel, complete with a garden with an outdoor pool. The good news is that it was completely renovated, so expect reasonably fresh, nice appointments and features such as the inBalance gym and a game station for kids. The location is north of the docklands, which makes it a reasonable choice pretty much only for those arriving by car. \n9 Park Inn by Radisson Antwerp, Koningin Astridplein 2018 Antwerp (right on Koningin Astrid Square 100 m from the Antwerpen Centraal station), \u260f +32 3 202 31 70, info.antwerpen@parkinn.com. Some rooms feature Nespresso machines. The heated pool and fitness centre at the Radisson Blu Astrid, 100 metres away, can be used free of charge. \u20ac99. \n10 Ramada Plaza Antwerp, Desguinlei 94. The Ramada Plaza is a glazed highrise tower overlooking a park, with 210 elegantly appointed rooms, geared towards business travellers. It is in the very south of the city, right next to the Berchem motorway junction. While the location is remote, there is a tram station next to the hotel. \n11 Scandic Antwerpen, Luitenant Lippenslaan 66, Borgerhout. If you are looking for minimalistic Scandinavian design, this is not the place - the Scandic Antwerpen looks every bit like a 1990s Hilton inside, a bunch of which the chain once operated. It is in Borgerhout, right outside Antwerp's motorway ringroad, which is convenient for those arriving by car and not for others. \n12 Tryp By Wyndham Antwerp (formerly \"SIR Plantin\"), Plantin en Moretuslei 136. The Tryp is a bit farther from the city's main attractions than some other hotels, but it compensates for that with attractive pricing and artsy decor, including renderings of traditional Dutch paintings as headboards. From \u20ac69. \n\n\nIndependent and boutique hotels\n Elzenveld, Lange Gasthuisstraat 45. A former hospital that advertises itself as a conference centre, but also offers accommodation. \n\n\nSplurge\n\nHotel Firean\n13 Hilton Antwerp, Groenplaats 32.

Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00. 4-star hotel overlooking the city park. 5 minutes' walk from diamond district and central station. \n15 Lindner Hotel & City Lounge Antwerpen, Lange Kievitstraat 125. This hotel belonging to a German upscale chain is hidden in a tower in a modern mixed development behind the Centraal station, and affords nice views of the city from its upper-floor lounges and gym, as well as comfortable rooms outfitted in a subdued, modern fashion. \u20ac140. \n Maison d'Anvers. \u20ac134. \n16 Radisson Blu Astrid Hotel, Antwerp, Koningin Astridplein 7 (across from the main rail station), \u260f +32 3 203 12 34, info.astrid.antwerp@radissonblu.com. Some might say that the biggest benefit of staying at the Astrid is not having to look at its peculiar postmodern facade. More tangible benefits include splendid location on the Astridplein just by the Antwerpen Centraal and large rooms with modern comforts. \n Hotel Rubens-Grote Markt. \u20ac170. \n Hotel 't Sandt. \u20ac170. \n Hotel De Witte Lelie. \u20ac295. \n\n\nConnect\nAs of July 2022, Antwerp has 5G from all Belgian carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places.\n\n\nStay safe\nMost parts of Antwerp are safe, but some neighborhoods are to be avoided in the evening, especially the area around De Coninckplein and the neighborhoods of Borgerhout, Seefhoek and the Schipperskwartier. Still, these neighbourhoods have a very lively atmosphere and so are definitely worth a visit during the day.\nMoreover, it is of utmost importance to lock your bike properly if left outside on the street throughout the city. If you need police assistance, the direct police number is 101. If you need a non-urgent police inquiry or the most nearby police station you can dial 0800/12312 for free. Most police officers in Antwerp are friendly and professional.\nAntwerp used to be a major stronghold of Flemish independence. Though most people are indifferent towards this movement nowadays, do not be surprised if you get occasional death stares if you speak any amount of French. This only concerns a minority (mostly older people and ultra-nationalists), but do refrain from assuming that everyone in the Antwerp area speaks (or is willing to speak) French.\nLike most of the rest of Europe, the number for emergencies (ambulance, police and fire) is 112.\n\n\nGo next\nAntwerp is a key railway hub on the high-speed line from the Netherlands to France, so you can get relatively quickly and easily not only around Belgium, but also to its two neighbours.\n\n\nBelgium\nGetting around Belgium is relatively easy from Antwerp, as the country is small and featuring one of the densest railway networks in the world. Some of the more popular destinations that can be visited on a day trip from Antwerp are:\n\nBruges (Brugge) \u2014 Very nice medieval town. Often called \"Venice of the North\", because of the many canals that flow through and under it. Well worth an overnight stay, since it is most romantic at night and very safe.\nBrussels \u2014 The capital of Belgium and some say, the capital of Europe. Multicultural and multilingual. Unfortunately, some of the city's historic (medieval) centre was destroyed at the end of the 19th century when Belgium seceded from the Netherlands and Brussels was made capital of the new country. Nonetheless, Brussels is known as a city of \"hidden gems,\" where you can turn a street corner in a less-than-breathtaking area and come face-to-face with an opulent and unexpected Art Deco or Art Nouveau building. Its popularity with tourists has been steadily increasing.\nGhent \u2014 A medieval town a bit like Bruges, with more emphasis on cathedrals and other big buildings. Great centre of medieval paintings exhibited in and around the cathedral of Sint-Baafs.\nNamur \u2014 The regional capital of Wallonia.\nLeuven \u2014 Nearly as lively as Antwerp or Brussels is this college town, home to one of the world's oldest universities is here. Many hotels also cater to businessmen who find Brussels too expensive.\n\n\nNetherlands\nAmsterdam \u2014 You can take a direct train to Amsterdam in the Netherlands. There is about one train an hour and it will take you about two hours to get there. Amsterdam is well known for its grachten, many bicycles, and coffee-shops. There also is the Eurostar high-speed train which is a bit more expensive but you will get there a lot faster.\nRotterdam \u2014 You can take a direct train to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. There is about one train an hour and it will take you about one hour to get there. Rotterdam is well known for its harbour.\nDen Bosch \u2014 You can go by train to this medieval city (change trains in Roosendaal).\nZeeland \u2014 Where the Schelde reaches the ocean. It's about two hours by train and you will have to change in Roosendaal.\nHulst \u2014 A very well-preserved historic fortified city very near Antwerp, which attracts lots of day-trippers from Belgium.\nSaeftinghe \u2014 Nature reserve known as The Drowned Land of Saeftinghe, on the border between Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n\nFrance\nLille \u2014 Lille is in the North of France just off the Belgian border. It is famous among others for having the largest bookstore in Europe (\"Le furet du Nord\"). The train ride is pretty long (sometimes over two hours) making it less easy for a day trip. The Dutch (Flemish) name is Rijsel and the town is not to be confused with another Flemish town called \"Lille\" in Dutch!\nParis \u2014 With the Eurostar, you can be there in about two hours.",
