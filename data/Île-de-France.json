  "extract": "\u00cele-de-France is the compact region immediately surrounding Paris. As such, the region includes all of the  metropolis, from the great French capital itself through the gritty inner banlieue right out to now far-flung suburbs and exurbs, together with several large surrounding towns that form part of the greater conurbation. All is not urban sprawl, however: the region is also known for its natural beauty, in the form of parks, forests and river lands, and also contains some of the most fertile agricultural soil in France.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe name \"\u00cele-de-France\" translates as \"island of France\", and though this etymology is unclear, it is thought to refer to the land between the rivers Seine, Marne and Oise, a sort of pseudo-\"island\" at the heart of France in a historical and cultural, if not geographic, sense. The north-east of the region is equally known as the Pays de France, which is essentially an agricultural terroir known for its cereal crops, though much of it has been overtaken by suburban sprawl and Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n\u00cele-de-France is easily the richest part of France, and is also one of Europe's most economically active regions. However, it is also one of the most unequal: the western departments of Hauts-de-Seine and Yvelines are home to some of the richest places in France (with the small town of Saint-Nom-la-Bret\u00e8che having the highest median income in the whole of France), while the northern department of Seine Saint-Denis is the poorest department in the whole of metropolitan France and which is associated with most of the negative stereotypes about Parisian suburbs. The majority of the region's inhabitants (who are known as Franciliens and Franciliennes), live and work somewhere in the dense Paris conurbation, leaving much of the rest of the territory rural and sparsely-populated.\nFrom the traveller's perspective, most of the region's interest will of course lie in Paris's mere 105 km2, and it is true that the City of Lights is a shining beacon among the world's great metropolises. Paris's icons are French icons, and many will struggle to even bring France to mind without thinking of the Eiffel Tower, of mimes working the streets of Montmartre, of Gothic M\u00e9tropolitain signs, or of Haussmannian boulevards lined with chic caf\u00e9s and fashion stores. So this guide won't try to persuade you to skip Paris; you absolutely must go there! But if you do decide to venture beyond the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, you will be richly rewarded.\n\u00cele-de-France's countryside is prosperous and agricultural. Dominated by its three major rivers, well-heeled market towns-cum-dormitory communities, and great ch\u00e2teaux from times gone by, it is a beautiful slice of rural France without having to stray far from the big city. The east of the region, the department of Seine-et-Marne, is especially lovely and forms part of the Champagne-growing area.\nAnd who could forget Disneyland Paris, Europe's most popular visitor attraction? For anyone who knows Disney's American parks, paying a visit to \"Chez Mickey\" - as the place is blithely known by the locals - will be at once familiar and bizarrely different. Seeing the pink ch\u00e2teau de Cendrillon against a moody northern French sky, rather than say Californian azure, is enough to make anyone think to herself \"Ah, le monde est petit !\" (It's a small world after all).\n\n\nDepartments\nThe region of Ile-de-France is divided into 8 separate d\u00e9partements, which can be classified into 3 main parts: inner Paris (Paris intramuros), the inner urban ring of Paris suburbs (la petite couronne) and the rural and semi-rural commuter belt hinterland (la grande couronne).\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nCities and towns\n\n1 Paris \u2013 the capital of France and focus of the region is on every traveller's wishlist, even the ones who have already been!\n\n\nSeine-et-Marne\n2 Fontainebleau \u2013 to the south of the metropolis lies a vast forested estate, known for its opulent ch\u00e2teau and wonderfully fresh air\n3 Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e \u2013 a large new town east of the capital, best known for Mickey Mouse's European pad\n4 Meaux \u2013 a cathedral city with an episcopal palace and historical centre to explore, known for being the home to an eponymous variety of brie.\n5 Provins \u2013 UNESCO listed fortified city in \u00cele-de-France's rural heartland, famous for its medieval heritage.\n\n\nYvelines\n6 Maisons-Laffitte \u2013 equestrian paradise and home to a beautiful garden city.\n7 Montfort l'Amaury  \u2013 voted one of France's best villages.\n8 Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines \u2013 conurbation of Elancourt, Trappes, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, Guyancourt, Plaisir, Voisins-le-Bretonneux, Magny-les-Hameaux, La Verri\u00e8re, Bois d'Arcy, Maurepas and Coigni\u00e8res. Tourists will come for France Miniature, for outdoor sports or the Haute Vall\u00e9e de Chevreuse National Park; it also has an impressive array of modern and postmodern architecture.\n9 Rambouillet \u2013 Former royal and presidential residence with castle and beautiful expansive grounds.\n10 Saint-Germain-en-Laye - a lively suburb 30 minutes west of Paris on the RER, it is best known for its Renaissance ch\u00e2teau. Also Poissy.\n11 Versailles \u2013 30 minutes west of Paris on the train, and above all prized for Louis XIV's incomparable ch\u00e2teau, which set the gold-standard for palace-dwellers the world over, and still continues to thrill, enchant and, depending on the crowds, exasperate millions of travellers to this day. Don't miss the majestic formal gardens and estate, Marie Antoinette's \"summer house\", which is really another palace in its own right, and the city of Versailles itself, which retains a smugly aristocratic elegance two centuries after its last king and queen lost their throne (and their heads).\n\n\nEssonne\n\n\nHauts-de-Seine\n12 Boulogne-Billancourt \u2013 one of Paris's nicer suburbs, at the tip of a peninsula carved by the snakelike Seine\n13 Levallois-Perret \u2013 perhaps Paris's wealthiest suburb, and in architecture, atmosphere and layout, very much an extension of the city. Together with neighbouring communes (Clichy and Neuilly-sur-Seine), Levallois has a large accommodation base at a slightly cheaper going rate than Paris \"intra muros\", without compromising on distance from attractions and the essential feel of being in Paris\n14 Rueil-Malmaison \u2013 a town in the outer western suburbs of Paris, home to a ch\u00e2teau and domaine that offer a similar experience to Versailles and Fontainebleau, but much cheaper, far less crowded and correspondingly more low-key\n15 Saint-Cloud, suburb west of Paris known for a beautiful park in the grounds of the former Palace of Saint-Cloud. Also covers Suresnes and S\u00e8vres.\n16 Sceaux, mini-Versailles without the tourists.\n\n\nSeine-Saint-Denis\n17 Bobigny\n18 Le Bourget \u2013  hosts the biannual Paris Air Show, and France's main state-owned aviation museum\n19 Saint-Denis \u2013 Somewhat rough-around-the edges northern Paris suburb, Saint-Denis nonetheless welcomes droves of visitors to its basilica, and to the Stade de France, France's national stadium\n\n\nVal-de-Marne\n20 Nogent-sur-Marne \u2013 riverside residential town famous for its guinguettes - restaurants and bars lining the river Marne.\n21 Vitry-sur-Seine \u2013 former industrial suburb now home to a modest street art scene and some art galleries.\n\n\nVal d'Oise\n22 Auvers-sur-Oise , former residence of Vincent van Gogh.\n23 Eragny\n24 Roissy \u2013 A historic city just outside its gates of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.  It retains its small-town charm, and has several points of interest if you're staying near the airport overnight, or just have a long layover.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nParis Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG IATA)\nParis Orly Airport (ORY IATA)\n\n\nBy train\nThere are seven main stations in Paris, and most of them welcome trains from bordering countries. They are connected through the m\u00e9tro and RER system only (no special shuttle).\n\nGare du Nord, (10th), M\u00e9tro: Gare du Nord - TGV trains from Belgium, the Netherlands, west Germany (Aachen, Cologne, D\u00fcsseldorf, Duisburg, Essen) (Thalys), and the United Kingdom (Eurostar from London and Kent) and regular trains from Hauts-de-France.\nGare d'Austerlitz, (13th), M\u00e9tro: Gare d'Austerlitz - regular trains from the centre and southwest of France (Orl\u00e9ans, Limoges, Toulouse the long way) and the majority of night trains.\nGare de l'Est, (10th), M\u00e9tro: Gare de l'Est - TGV to and from Luxembourg, ICE/TGV from south Germany (Saarbr\u00fccken, Kaiserslautern, Mannheim, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Augsburg, and Munich), \u00d6BB night train from Austria (Wien, Sankt P\u00f6lten, Linz, Salzburg) and Germany (Rosenheim, Munich, Karlsruhe).\nGare de Lyon, (12th), M\u00e9tro: Gare de Lyon - regular and TGV trains from southern and eastern France: French Alps, Marseille, Lyon, Dijon, Switzerland (Basel, Geneva, Lausanne, Bern, Zurich) and southwest Germany (M\u00fcllheim, Freiburg im Breisgau). You can also catch trains to Italy (Turin, Milan).\nGare de Bercy, (12th), M\u00e9tro: Bercy. Regular trains to Auvergne and Burgundy.\nGare St Lazare, (8th) M\u00e9tro: St-Lazare - trains  from Normandie.\nGare Montparnasse, (15th), M\u00e9tro: Montparnasse-Bienven\u00fce - TGV and regular trains from the west and south-west of France (Tours, Brest, Rennes, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse the fastest way and Hendaye near the Spanish border. Gare Vaugirard is an extension of Gare Montparnasse.\nThere are also three peripheral stations located on the outskirts of the Paris conurbation which welcome national and some international high speed trains:\n\nGare A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV, Paris CDG Airport, RER: Line B - Welcomes TGV trains from all over France and Belgium, all of which avoid central Paris. Helpful if you're visiting northern \u00cele-de-France.\nGare de Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e \u2014 Chessy, Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, RER: Line A - Adjacent to Disneyland Paris, it receives TGVs travelling across France avoiding Paris, mainly on a northeast - southwest (e.g. Strasbourg to Bordeaux) or north to southeast (e.g. Lille to Lyon) route. Helpful if you're visiting eastern \u00cele-de-France.\n1 Gare de Massy TGV (Massy, roughly 14 km south of Paris (Porte d'Orl\u00e9ans), RER (Massy \u2014 Palaiseau): Lines B, C). On the LGV Atlantique line which links Paris Montparnasse and eastern/northern France to the west and southwest. Helpful if you're visiting southern or western \u00cele-de-France.   (updated Jul 2018)\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bike\nThere are many cycle lanes on routes into Paris, but be careful as you also share the road with motorists who can be inconsiderate.\n\n\nBy car\nThere are several free autoroutes and 4-lane roads for getting round \u00cele-de-France, however on weekdays there is a lot of congestion between the hours 08:00-09:30 and 17:30-19:30, and it is really not advisable to travel then. This congestion becomes a lot less worse the further away from Paris you are.\n\nLe Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique: a ring road which marks the limit of \"Paris intra muros\" (essentially the central city as distinct from its suburbs). This is essentially a motorway as there are no roundabouts or intersections, however it is famous for its traffic jams. Be careful though, as the cars entering onto the road from the right have priority over vehicles already on the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique.\nA13: (direction Rouen) Western Autoroute\nA6: (direction Lyon) Southern Autoroute\nA5: (direction Lyon) South eastern Autoroute\nA86: Very useful road that nearly completely circles Paris. The tunnel between Rueil-Malmaison and Versailles is tolled (fairly expensive) and is open to cars only (trucks and motorcycles prohibited).\nA14: Toll road, fairly expensive.\nN104 La Francilienne: A half-circular road around the eastern side of Paris. As it is further out than the A86, there is considerably less congestion.\nN118: Connect western Paris to A10 and N104.\n\n\nBy train\nA network of regional trains (RER) takes you in and out of Paris. The RER has 256 stops in and around Paris, and runs on over 587 km (365 mi) of track. There are 5 lines, (A, B, C, D and E) that cross Paris, connecting suburbs on opposite sides. The stations are marked with blue signs with a white RER. The rest of the regional network, called \"Transilien\", departs from the main train stations (Lyon for line R, Est for line P, Nord for lines H and K, St-Lazare for lines J and L, Montparnasse for line N) and La D\u00e9fense (line U). Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.\nTickets are only valid for the trip purchased, while passes use a 5-zone system. Check when purchasing, timetables, fare information, and maps for both systems can be found in on the English version of the Transilien website.\nIf you arrive on Thursday or before is may be worth investigating the Navigo D\u00e9couverte card which can be loaded with a weekly pass valid for all \u00cele-de-France (inc Paris) travel zones on almost all methods of public transport, see Paris \"Using the m\u00e9tro and the suburban train\" section\nTrains run from 04:45 to 01:30. Smoking is not allowed in the stations or on the trains.\n\n\nSee\n\nThe suburbs and countryside around Paris are filled with wonderful palaces, gardens and parks that are almost unknown to tourists outside France. Although the palace of Versailles is by far the best-known, other palaces offer a similar experience and draw far fewer crowds, including the Parc de Saint-Cloud, the Parc de Sceaux and the Ch\u00e2teaus of Malmaison, Fontainebleau and Rambouillet. Head over to Saint-Germain-en-Laye and walk along the Grande Terrasse for a great view of the West of Paris.\nAlthough there are a number of traditional scenic villages and towns to explore in the countryside, including the mediaeval towns of Provins and Montfort l'Amaury as well as the 18th- and 19th-century garden cities of Maisons-Laffitte and Le V\u00e9sinet, the suburbs and new towns around Paris also offer a whole host of more modern architectural gems. The suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt is well-known for its Art Deco architecture from the 1930s, while the new towns of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and Noisy-le-Grand/Val d'Europe host an array of surreal postmodern architecture from the 80s to the present day that may be of interest to some, not to mention the transport and economic hub of La D\u00e9fense.\nSome of the best museums outside the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique ring road include the Albert Kahn Museum, the Museum of aviation and spaceflight, the MAC VAC Museum of Contemporary Art and the Mus\u00e9e Fragonard.\nFor the kids, there's the France Miniature theme park and, of course, Disneyland Paris.\n\n\nDo\nThe region is filled with nice parks and forests with some pleasant and easy hiking/cycling trails, including the Coul\u00e9e Verte and the Ceinture Verte (Green Belt).\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nStay safe\nMost of the roughest suburbs of Paris are located in the northern departments of Seine Saint-Denis and Val d'Oise as well as in some suburbs in the south-east along the Seine. Examples of suburbs with a particularly bad reputation are Saint-Denis, Bobigny, Grigny and Sarcelles. By contrast, the western departments are generally more affluent and very safe, with the main exceptions being Trappes, as well as some of the post-industrial towns downstream of the Seine (e.g. Mantes-la-Jolie, Les Mureaux) and in the extreme north of Hauts-de-Seine (e.g. Gennevilliers and parts of Nanterre).\nWithin the confines of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, tourists should be wary in parts of the 18th and the 19th arrondissements and generally stay clear of areas close to the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique and the Petite Ceinture at night, particularly around Stalingrad and Porte de la Chapelle.\n\n\nGo next",
