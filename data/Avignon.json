  "extract": "Avignon is the capital of the French department of Vaucluse in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, and is on the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne river. Avignon was one of the European Cities of Culture in 2000 and its historical centre has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Prior to the latter's annexation by France in 1791, Avignon was the papal capital of the independent Comtat Venaissin.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAvignon is famous as the city to which the Popes fled when leaving the corruption of Rome in the 14th century. Le Palais des Papes (Palace of Popes) which was built then is the world's largest Gothic building. It was largely emptied over the centuries, and its vast stone rooms are filled with little more than old frescos, but it is still an imposing building. The Ramparts themselves were erected to keep the plague and invaders out during the turbulent Middle Ages, when Avignon belonged to the papacy and not the French crown.\nIts early history is much older than the popes, however. Avignon occupies a strategic location for several reasons - it is at the confluence of two once-mighty rivers: the Rh\u00f4ne, still one of the biggest rivers in France, and the now largely-dammed Durance. Both were important routes of trade and communication even in prehistoric times. In addition, there is a long island in the Rhone that made it possible to ferry people and goods across, and later bridge the river, more easily than in other places.\nThe city has a population of 92,000 people (2017), 16,000 of which live 'intra-muros,' or within the ramparts built in the 14th century.\nThe city is now sprinkled with buildings and monuments ranging from the new to the old, the very old, and the ageless.\n\n\nHistory\nAvignon has been continuously inhabited since the stone age, when habitations were built in caves in the \u201cRocher des Doms\u201d, a massive outcropping of rock rising over the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne. Today, a public park with benches, views over the surrounding countryside, a caf\u00e9 and playground is on top of the Rocher.\nThe Romans had a presence in Avignon, though the walls they built lie buried somewhere under the modern streets. Vestiges of the forum can still be seen, lying unassumingly near the Rue Racine and the Rue Saint-\u00c9tienne, to the west of the city.\nThen, in medieval times, the town grew to an important center of communication and trade. The stone bridge spanning the Rhone was one of only three between the Mediterranean and Lyon. It was undoubtedly for its strategic location and ease of travel that it was chosen by the papacy as home within the then kingdom of Provence. The presence of the papacy made Avignon into a city of great political and economic activity. The old city wall, now visible only as a street that circles the centre of the town (changing names 5 times in the process!) was much too small and a larger wall, still visible today, was necessary to protect its bulging population. Wealthy Cardinals built extravagant palaces known as livr\u00e9es both within Avignon and across the river, in Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon.\nThe city teemed with activity and building as architects, builders, artists flocked to the town. At that time, within the city walls there were over 100 churches and chapels - many of which have been transformed since then into everything from shops to a movie theatre! The wealth and activity generated by the presence of the papacy spilled out into the region, so that even small villages nearby boast a rich architectural past.\n\n1 Office de Tourisme d'Avignon, 41, cours Jean Jaur\u00e8s BP8, \u260f +33 4 32 74 32 74, officetourisme@avignon-tourisme.com.

In the season there is also an information point at the TGV Station (updated Jun 2015)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 A\u00e9roport d'Avignon-Caumont (Avignon Airport AVN  IATA). No flights operate to Avignon.   \n\n\nBy train\n2 Gare d'Avignon Centre (Avignon central station), Boulevard Saint-Roch. Local and regional trains call at the central station, just outside the walls on the southern edge of the old town.   \n3 Gare d'Avignon TGV (Avignon TGV Station), Avenue de la Gare, 84000 (about 2 km out of town; a regular shuttle train to the Avignon central station). Avignon lies on the TGV line from Paris (2\u00bd hr) to Marseille. It is also served by numerous local and regional services. Eurostar operates several services a week from London St. Pancras International, with a journey time of around 6 hours   \n\n\nBy bus\nAvignon is connected to most other European cities with Flixbus. For regional travelers, following your common source, you can take: the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement buses of the \"TransVaucluse Network\"; departmental buses of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, whose schedules are available on Lepilote; or departmental \"cars du Gard\", working under the name of \"Edgar\". All lines to the terminal bus station Avignon, which is near the train station and the walls surrounding the city center.\n\n\nBy boat\nWhile there is no regular boat line in Avignon, you can arrive by boat in Avignon via river cruises.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Paris or Lyon, you can reach Avignon by the Autoroute du Soleil and take the Avignon-Nord exit and follow the N107 then the D225 towards AVIGNON Centre. This urban road leads straight to the famous Avignon bridge just before where you have a large pay car park (car park the Palais des Papes), which leads directly onto the Place du Palais des Papes in the heart of the city.\nOther parking solutions, the municipality has set up 2 \"relay parking + free shuttle\" lots, with one bus every 10 minutes from 10:00 to 22:00. The first \"Parking Italians\" , accessible the D225 road which runs. Circuit the shuttle drops users in the intramural centre, near the Town Hall Square; the second is located on the Ile de la Barthelasse (head Villeneuve l\u00e8s Avignon and follow the signs). The shuttle drops users at Gate Oulle, about 200 m from the bridge of Avignon (Saint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge).\nFrom Montpellier or N\u00eemes, exit on the A9 (exit Roquemaure, the first after the junction with the A7), then follow the direction Avignon.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe old city centre is not very big and can be easily explored on foot. An automatic bike sharing scheme called V\u00e9lopop' allows you to ride along. Smartcard needed.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Papal Palace (Palais des Papes), Place du palais des papes. This is the palace where the Popes of Avignon ruled. For part of the period the Papacy was divided, with a Pope in Rome and another in Avignon. Most of the artwork inside (statues, frescoes) was destroyed during the French Revolution, but the impressive building still stands, and little bits of artwork, such as those that were too high to be convenient to ruin, remain.   \n\n2 Pont Saint-B\u00e9nezet (Pont d'Avignon). It is a ruined bridge not far from the Palais des Papes. The bridge was built in the Middle Ages \u2014 before the arrival of the Papacy \u2014 perhaps partly to allow the local bishop to cross the river to Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon, where the church authorities had installed themselves because of Avignon's then-infamous dirt and lawlessness.The legend of the bridge's building is that a local shepherd, Benezet (a dialect form of Benedict) was inspired by angels to build a bridge. When his appeals to the town authorities proved fruitless, he picked up a vast block of stone and hurled it into the river, to be the bridge's foundation stone. Convinced by this demonstration of divine will, the bridge was swiftly built. The poor shepherd boy was canonised, and his chapel remains on the surviving portion of the bridge.The bridge was built with 22 arches, reaching across to the tower of Philippe le Bel via small mid-stream islands. Over the centuries, as the islands shifted and merged into today's \u00eele de la Barthelasse, the bridge was repeatedly lost to floods and repeatedly rebuilt; after a series of 17th-century floods, it was abandoned and only 4 of the 22 arches remain. A multilingual audio tour of the bridge explains some of the local history.A well-known song \"Sur Le Pont D'Avignon\" (on the bridge at Avignon) refers to the bridge. The bridge is far too narrow for dancing or festivals - the original text of the song was \"Sous (under) le pont d'Avignon\", referring to the festivals and entertainments staged on the \u00eele de la Barthelasse. The current version was popularised by a 19th-century operetta, whose librettist clearly assumed that 'sous le pont d'Avignon' would have meant in the river.  (updated Mar 2024)\nOther popular tourist destinations include: the 3 Place du Palais, just next to the 4 Place de L'horloge, though someone may find these places shockingly expensive, and overcrowded in season. Within a short distance in just about any direction are some smaller squares frequented by the locals, and much lower prices. Like 5 Place Pie, with its covered market (open 06:00 to 13:00 everyday) which sells fresh produce, cheeses, wines, and produits du pays.\n\n\nMuseums\nAvignon has its share of museums, ranging from modern art museums to museums housing artefacts from the Roman and pre-Roman days.\n\n6 Collection Lambert, 5 Rue Violette (300 metres north of Gare d'Avignon Centre).

Avignon is famous the world over for its annual theatre festival. For three or four weeks in July the city is virtually swollen with street performers, actors, musicians, and of course the ubiquitous tourists. The festival is an excuse to turn any room with enough seating into a 'salle de spectacle' and the city is host to a wide variety of entertainment. The gem of this festival are the performances which take place inside the Pope's Palace itself. Tickets are expensive, but this is considered by many French and European thespians to be a crowning achievement of their career. The vast majority of performances are, of course, in French but a number of foreign companies perform in other languages including English. Even without attending any events, the atmosphere and street theatre give the city a marvellous feeling.   \n The International Congress Center.
