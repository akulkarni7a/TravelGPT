  "extract": "For the Caribbean island, see Montserrat.\n\nMontserrat is a multi-peaked mountain in Catalonia and part of the Montserrat Natural Park. Santa Maria de Montserrat monastery situated high up in the unusual rock mountain is very popular among Catalans, and Catholic pilgrims come from far and wide to see the Black Madonna. Is a stage in the Catalan Way of St. James\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe monastery is Catalonia's most important religious retreat and groups of young people from Barcelona and all over Catalonia make overnight hikes at least once in their lives to watch the sunrise from the heights of Montserrat.\nAt 1,236 m above the valley floor (Sant Jeroni summit), Montserrat is the highest point of the Catalan lowlands, and stands central to the most populated part of Catalonia. The stone monolith is ideally located to play an important role in the cultural and spiritual life of Catalonia.\nHowever, don't expect a tranquil and enlightening experience at the top; the monastery is surrounded by many touristy boutiques, shops, stands and restaurants.\n\n\nGet in\nMontserrat is about 48 km away from Barcelona, and is easily accessible by train, car and bus.\nMost public transit options will take you to the Montserrat-Aeri or Monistrol de Montserrat terminals at the foot of the mountains, where you transfer to cable car or rack railway to reach Montserrat and its monastery, high up in the mountains.\n\n\nBy train\nIf you plan to take the train from Barcelona, decide before you leave Barcelona whether you will take the cable car (from Montserrat-Aeri) or rack railway (from Monistrol de Montserrat) for the second stage of the journey because they leave from different train stops and tickets are either including the cable car or the rack railway (return ticket \u20ac25.80). You can buy a combined, round trip ticket for both the train and either the cable car or the rack railway when you depart from Barcelona, at a discount from buying individual tickets for each segment of the journey.\nTravelling from Barcelona, take FGC (R5 Line) train from Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya to Montserrat-Aeri (or Monistrol de Montserrat respectively). Trains run every hour and travel time for the R5 is around 60 min each way. There are combined tickets available for train and rack railway or cable car, see website below. The combined tickets can be bought from the vending machines at the train station, or at the booth located right in front of the access gates to the trains. Buying from the booth is recommended as you'll also be given a brochure with an overview of the surroundings of the monastery and train timetables. It\u2019s also possible to buy a voucher for a ticket through the website, which can be exchanged at the railway station. \n\n1 Aeri de Montserrat railway station (Estaci\u00f3n de Aeri de Montserrat).  (updated Apr 2021)\n2 Monistrol de Montserrat railway station (Estaci\u00f3n de Monistrol de Montserrat).  (updated Apr 2021)\n\n\nBy bus\nYou have two options by bus:\n\nAutocares Julia leaves Barcelona Sants daily at 09:15 and takes you straight to the Monastry's Plaza del Funicular. Return trip departs Jun\u2013Sep, 18:00 or Oct\u2013May, 17:00. The trip is 1 hr 30 min and costs \u20ac5.10 each way.\nBages Express departs Barcelona once or twice hourly from the Ronda de la Universitat, on the east corner of the Pla\u00e7a de la Universitat. It takes you to Monistrol de Montserrat, where you must transfer to the rack railway. Travel time is about the same as the train and if you are in the old town of Barcelona, it may be easier to get to the stop than use the metro to get to the Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya station. Cost is \u20ac5.10 one-way to Monistrol de Montserrat. Timetable on the Bages Express website. \n\n\nBy car\nThe top is also accessible by road, but it will cost you.\nThe cheaper option will be to park at the cable car (free) or the Monistrol-Vila rack railway station and get up from there. There is also a very large free car park at Monistrol-Vila, on the north side of Monistrol de Montserrat. As well as being cheaper than the cable car, the stop at the top is slightly closer to the monastery and the funiculars, and the last train down is later than the last cable car.\n\n\nBy cable car\n3 Aeri de Montserrat (Cable Car). \u20ac7.80 one-way, \u20ac11.20 round-trip.   (updated May 2024)\nFrom Montserrat-Aeri, take the cable car up to the monastery. The cable car is also convenient for those arriving by car. Parking at the Montserrat-Aeri rail station is easy and free. The trains arrive every hour from Barcelona, so there will be queues at those times, but it is quiet just before they arrive. If there is a long queue, it is worth visiting the El Rincon cafe. Go though the tunnel, turn left and follow the platform to the end.\n\n\nBy rack railway\n4 Rack Railway. \u20ac8.40 one-way, \u20ac14 round-trip.   (updated Oct 2024)\nWhen arriving by train at Monistrol de Montserrat, change for the rack railway (Cremallera de Montserrat). The rack railway uses the same train platform as the R5 train from Barcelona.\nThe rack railway takes 20 min of travel and makes one stop en route to the monastery, at Monistrol-Vila (where the free car-park can be found). The service from the main station is always only one rack railway train per hour, but may be a service every twenty minutes from the rack railway's stop at Monistrol-Vila, so although it is a bit further to walk, you are likely to be better off going through the town there rather than crossing the bridge to the main station.\nWhen returning, make sure to get off at the right stop, depending on your onward travel option\u2014by car (Monistrol-Vila, first stop from the top) or by train/bus (Monistrol de Montserrat, second stop from the top). Trains from Montserrat Monestir to Monistrol de Montserrat leave every hour at 15 past the hour, from 09:15 until 18:15, or until 20:15 depending on the season.\n\n\nOn foot\nYou can also hike up to the monastery from either Montserrat-Aeri (i.e. near the cable car) or Monistrol de Montserrat (the start of the rack railway and end of the regular R5 train), which takes about 1 hr or 1 hr 30 min respectively. Consult OpenStreetMap for the trails.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nMost of the Montserrat monastery complex is explorable on foot.\n\n\nBy funicular\n5 Funicular de la Santa Cova. If visiting the Santa Cova, there is a funicular which copes with the steepest part, although its lower stop is a bit far away from the Santa Cova itself. It is very useful on the way back as it's uphill. 4.10\u20ac (one-way), 6.30\u20ac (return).   (updated Oct 2024)\n6 Funicular de Sant Joan. 10:00 until 18:30. This funicular connects the monastery and an upper viewing point. The upper viewing point is at the junction of three hiking trails: they connect to the monastery, to the hermitage of Santa Magdalena, and to the Sant Jeroni summit. 10,70\u20ac (one-way) 16.50\u20ac (return).   (updated Oct 2024)\n\n\nSee\n\n\nMonastery and the Black Virgin of Montserrat\nSanta Maria de Montserrat is a Benedictine abbey which hosts the Virgin of Montserrat, and the Publicacions de l'Abadia de Montserrat, a publishing house, the oldest press in the world, still running, with the first book published in 1499.\n\n1 Basilica. 07:30-20:00. Construction on the basilica of Montserrat began in the 16th century, and Pope Leo XIII granted it the status of minor basilica in 1881. Its current fa\u00e7ade, however, dates back to the middle of the 20th century, and includes a representation of the monks who died during the Spanish Civil War. The basilica is open daily from 07:30 to 20:00, but keep in mind mass is held several times throughout the day. (updated Jul 2019)\n2 Virgin of Montserrat (La Moreneta). 08:00-10:30 and 12:00-18:15 all year, also 19:15-20:00 Jul 15-Sep 30. A statue of the Virgin Mary and infant Christ, and one of the two patron saints of Catalonia. She is popularly known in Catalan as La Moreneta, meaning \u201cthe little dark one\u201d, due to the darkness of her skin. Believed by some to have been carved in Jerusalem in the early days of the Church, it is more likely a Romanesque sculpture in wood from the late 12th century. It can be seen inside of the basilica.   (updated Jul 2019)\n3 Escolania choir. Salve: M-F 13:00, Su 12:00; Vespers: M-Th Su 18:45. A boys\u2019 choir, one of the oldest in Europe, which performs during religious ceremonies in the basilica: you can attend either the midday Salve and Virolai, or the evening Vespers. Times may vary due to religious celebrations and school holidays; so do check the daily calendar on the choir\u2019s website. Expect large crowds, especially for the midday Salve, which is the most visited daily act at the monastery. The choir may be accompanied, as required by the repertory, by the Montserrat Chapel Choir, composed of old choirboys, and the monks of the Ministry Chapel Choir.   (updated Jul 2019)\n4 Museum of Montserrat. Daily 10:00-18:45. While tracing its origins to an early 20th-century monk\u2019s \u2018Biblical Museum\u2019, the museum\u2019s collection today goes beyond religious works, and includes modern paintings by famous artists like Picasso and Dal\u00ed. Reserve about one to two hours for a visit. \u20ac8.   (updated Jul 2019)\n\n\nPanorama\nEnjoy the fantastic views over the local landscape. This is best done by taking the Funicular de Sant Joan to the top.\n\n\nDo\n\nThere are four main hiking trails that can be done around the monastery. These lead to the hermitage of Santa Magdalena, and to Sant Jeroni, the highest point of Montserrat. At an altitude of 1,237 m, almost all of Catalonia can be seen from Sant Jeroni, and on a clear day, the island of Majorca is visible. The trails are well marked with signs along the way, but you may still want to pick up a map at the tourist information office first. At the upper station of the Funicular de Sant Joan, there\u2019s a sign with a map, listing the four trails as:\n\nTrail 1 connects the upper station of the Funicular de Sant Joan and Sant Jeroni, the summit. The trail also passes two other viewing points, and the chapel of Sant Jeroni. A return trip takes about 2 hours.\nTrail 2 connects the monastery and a junction on the first trail. It can be used as an alternative route to, or back down from, the Sant Jeroni summit. It also passes by the hermitage of Santa Anna and the chapel of Sant Bennet. Note that compared to the first trail, the second trail covers a bigger height difference in a shorter distance; there are some steep steps along the way. It takes about an hour for a single trip.\nTrail 3 connects the upper and lower stations of the Funicular de Sant Joan. It\u2019s used as a driving route by staff, so it can be easily walked, which takes about 40 minutes.\nTrail 3a connects the upper station of the Funicular de Sant Joan and the hermitage of Santa Magdalena. There\u2019s a viewing point along the way, as well as the chapel of Sant Joan, and the hermitages of Sant Joan and Sant Onofre. A return trip takes about 45 minutes. Note that this trail has sections with little shade, so you may want to avoid walking it in midday sun.\nAlthough trail 2 is listed as less difficult than trail 1 on the tourist information signs, the easiest trip to and from Sant Jeroni seems to be to follow trail 1, using the funicular to get to its starting point and to return the same way.\n\nWay of St. James - Catalan segment from El Port de la Selva or Llan\u00e7\u00e0 to Montserrat (Spain) to the Way of St.James - Ebro segment, passes the site.\n\n\nBuy\nAs you exit the rack railway or cable car, there is a fairly large curio shop across the way that carries a variety of tourist items, including Catalonian olive oil, chocolate, liqueur, books, jewellery, clothing, religious articles, and toys, as well as monastery-related goods such as recordings of the choir and guidebooks. There is another gift shop at the entrance to the museum that offers different items.\nThere is also a marketplace, which offers many delectable homemade goods sold by locals, including honey, pastries, preserves, cured meat and sweets. You will also find 2 local cheeses, produced only in Montserrat.\n\n\nEat and drink\nRestaurants in Montserrat around the monastery exist but are expensive.\nIt's a good idea to bring your own lunch, especially if you plan to walk away from the central area or go up the funicular to the top of the mountain. There is no restaurant at Sant Jeroni, although there is a cafe adjoining gift shop where the rack railway and cable cars terminate at their upper ends (at the bottom of the Sant Jeroni and Santa Cova funiculars). If you're coming from Barcelona, a good plan is to get up early and head to La Boqueria, the big open market near the head of Las Ramblas, to stock up on sandwich ingredients and snacks - bread, cheese, meat, olives, wine, etc. Pack it up and bring it with you.\n\n1 El Rincon cafe and bar, Montserrat-Aeri rail station (Off the northern end of the active platform). Simple bar and outdoor cafe serving freshly prepared snacks, sandwiches and paella. (updated Sep 2016)\n\n\nStay safe\nAlthough the town of Montserrat is relatively safe and tourist-friendly, it can be very dangerous for hiking as much of it is uncharted woodland. If you are traveling with a group do not stray from them if you decide to go hiking. If you find out that someone has been separated from your group, summon the local authorities. It is best not to wander off the paths - there are steep drops, even close to the funicular top station.\n\n\nGo next\nCol\u00f2nia G\u00fcell \u2013 A tiny settlement famous for its modernist architecture, on the railway line to Barcelona.",
