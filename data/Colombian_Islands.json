  "extract": "Colombia has several island territories in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.\n\n\nDestinations\n\n\nCaribbean\n\n\nPacific\n\n\nUnderstand\nNortheast of San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia are several uninhabited shoals, banks, and atolls (some of which are wholly submerged either all the time or during high tide), which are administered by Colombia. They are nearly all mired in territorial disputes with various Central American states as well as the United States, and are not tourist destinations.\n\n\nTalk\nThe main language spoken is Spanish, but many speak English as well. The actual natives from the island speak \"patua\", which is a mix of English, Spanish, and French.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nDaily flights serve various Colombian cities  (Medell\u00edn, Cali and Bogot\u00e1) to San Andres's Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport (ADZ IATA). All flights to Providencia (PVA IATA) are originated in San Andr\u00e9s.\nDirect flights also depart from San Jose, Costa Rica and Panama City, Panama to San Andres.\n\n\nBy boat\nThe closest mainland area to San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia is Caribbean Nicaragua, particularly Bluefields. There are sometimes cruises or ferries, but they are rarely advertised online and just going to the port and hoping you get lucky will likely not work.\n\n\nGet around\nBus is the main form of transportation on the island. It is cheap and convenient. Most buses connect the main city of San Andres with other parts of the island. Also there are many places to rent everything from cars, to motorcycles, to bikes.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\nScuba diving is amazing here, as is snorkeling. There are many places that offer jet skis, kayaks, wind surfing, kite surfing, horseback riding, submarine tours and many other options. There are also many people that come here mainly for the great duty free shopping and cheaper electronics.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\nSan Andres is a perfectly safe Caribbean island to visit, that is many many miles away from some of the problems found on the mainland.\n\n\nGo next",
