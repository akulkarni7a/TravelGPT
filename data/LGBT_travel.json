  "extract": "LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other) people often have special concerns or interests when travelling.  This page lists three things: events and activities of special interest to, or targeted towards, LGBT travellers; destinations where being out as LGBT is acceptable; and destinations where it might be dangerous to travel if one's transgender status or nonheterosexual orientation is known.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nOn Wikivoyage, \"LGBT\" is used as a consistent, all-inclusive term. Some individuals and groups add other letters to explicitly include other groups (\"Q\" for \"queer\" and \"questioning\", \"I\" for \"intersex\", \"A\" for \"asexual\", etc.), but this quickly becomes unwieldy. \"Gay\" is often understood to refer to homosexual men, but it is sometimes used as an umbrella term, such as in \"gay pride parades\" or \"gay culture\", to include all parts of the LGBT community.\nSome other languages use terminology borrowed from English with slightly different interpretation. Many cultures have domestic concepts for sexual minorities.\nMany major Western cities have vibrant, world-famous gay districts that are major tourist attractions, and often worth visiting even if you are not gay.\n\n\nGay districts\nIn the largest cities, there is often one neighbourhood which was traditionally a \"gay ghetto\" or \"gay village\" with many small, independent businesses operated by LGBT proprietors or serving a primarily LGBT client\u00e8le. Some (such as Castro Street in San Francisco) were nationally famous in their heyday.\nIn many cities, there was an alternative local weekly or monthly newspaper which served as a printed index of all of the other LGBT offerings in the \"ghetto\", \"village\" or community. There were specialised book stores with books and media from gay authors; there were women's book stores which specialised in feminist texts from small, independent niche publishing houses which espoused the cause of women and sexual minorities. There was gay apparel, there was gay pornography, there were all manner of unusual items which might not have been readily available anywhere else. There were places to eat which were owned by LGBT proprietors, gay bars (which were the primary meeting places of yesteryear when there were few other LGBT options) and bed and breakfasts which were owned and operated by LGBT couples or were welcoming to LGBT travelers.\nThe big-city LGBT commercial districts were most known for their nightlife \u2013 the endless bars, the hilarious drag shows \u2013 but were also the home of many non-commercial community organisations ranging from LGBT discussion groups to gay sports teams, swim clubs, choirs or other activities which brought members of the community together under one or more common interests.\nIn the 21st century, a bit of this gay local colour is beginning to fade. As the level of discrimination declines, the need to concentrate the community in one big-city neighbourhood is gradually vanishing. Neighbourhoods which were once LGBT enclaves are being gentrified; the original residents who made the community what it was are being increasingly priced out of the market and into nondescript, mainstream suburbs. Pride parades which were once small but daring expressions of political dissent have become huge, commercialised events; they're larger than ever, but the original message has been lost in a demographic marketing gold rush in which big corporate sponsors brand and monetise the parades to sell more beer or other consumer commodities. The small alternative local newspapers, periodicals and alternative book stores are declining just as dramatically and rapidly as all other print media; many publications have abandoned their print editions to go Internet-only. People who used to meet at LGBT bars (or at the gay saunas and bathhouses which were infamous as hotbeds of sexual activity) are now increasingly instead meeting online.\nNonetheless, an LGBT neighbourhood or \"village\" still exists quite openly in most large metropolitan areas with colourful independent local businesses and community organisations which are out, loud and proud. It's worth checking local listings before you go to see what's on offer.\n\n\nLGBT laws\n\nIn some parts of the world LGBT visitors are welcome, but this is not true of most African, Caribbean, Pacific Island and Middle Eastern countries where it would be a bad idea, and in some cases dangerous, to express who you are completely. In some countries (particularly where LGBT expression or activity is legally restricted), police do little or nothing to investigate brutal anti-gay violence. Sometimes, they are part of the problem.\nMost East Asian countries do not have any laws against homosexuality, though with the notable exception of Taiwan, there are also no anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation. Acceptance of homosexuality tends not to be as good as in Western countries, and homosexual relationships are generally not given legal recognition. Nevertheless, given that the violent crime rate in East Asia is generally low, you are unlikely to get anything more than stares and whispers, and unprovoked anti-homosexual violence is almost unheard of.\nIssues may also present themselves for transgender and gender non-conforming voyagers: in countries with strict sex segregation, the sex listed on your ID and your appearance conflicting may turn into a major problem. In some countries cross-dressing is illegal. Toilets and communal showers may cause some problems, or at least confusion, even in countries that generally accept LGBT expression.\nEven where LGBT rights are recognised, there is no guarantee of ready acceptance from locals. Even in the United States and Western Europe where, for the most part, homosexuality is legal, gay-bashing sometimes occurs, though general intolerance of anti-gay acts is \u2013 slowly \u2013 increasing. While being transgender or gender non-conforming is illegal in fewer countries, transgender and gender non-conforming people can face considerable risks of victimization and violence, especially when the non-conformity is apparent.\nILGA (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) has more specific information and news about LGBT rights around the world. Global Affairs Canada has an in-depth information page for Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and two-spirit Canadians abroad, which may be relevant also for other nationalities.\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nSee also: Wedding travel\nLegally-binding same-sex marriages, first solemnised in Amsterdam in 2001, are now performed in many countries around the world including (as of 2024) Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay, and parts of the Netherlands (legal in the European portion of the country but not in Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, or Sint Maarten). Same-sex marriage will become legal in January 2025 in Liechtenstein (01/01/2025) and Thailand (22/01/2025). In addition, some countries perform or recognize unions similar to marriage between two same-sex persons, the names and forms of which vary considerably around the world.\nSome countries, like Israel and China, will recognize same-sex marriages conducted abroad (in China for the purposes of spousal visas in Beijing), but will not grant local marriages. \nBritish citizens may have access to marriage in a limited number of British consulates abroad in nations which neither object to nor offer same-sex marriage locally.\nVery few countries in the modern era grant captains of ships flying their flag in international waters the right to officiate marriage. Weddings aboard ships at sea were briefly offered by the Bermuda-flagged Carnival line (Cunard, Princess and P&O) vessels; as of 2018, their legal status has been oscillating as the Bermudan government continues to legislate against same-sex marriage and court decisions strike down those laws.\nThe willingness of individual churches and temples to solemnise same-sex marriage varies. One option is a non-religious wedding, such as a civil wedding (at a city hall or court house) or a secular humanist officiant who may conduct a wedding in the venue of your choice. The Metropolitan Community Church was founded to reach out to the LGBT community, the Unitarian Universalist churches and the Society of Friends (Quakers) are usually supportive and a few other groups (such as an Affirming United group within the United Church of Canada) embrace equality. Some of these groups have marched in local Pride events. In some religious communities same sex marriage is an area of dispute; e.g. in Finland the Lutheran church has not decided officially on the matter (there is not a big enough majority either way) and some priests do wed same-sex couples despite some bishops thinking that they do not have the right to do so.\nAs laws vary, marriages (and less-than-marriage civil partnerships) from foreign jurisdictions may not be recognized as valid in your home country, and indeed, a married same-sex couple may not be recognized as such in some countries. Residence or citizenship requirements for marriage (and divorce) also vary between nations. If your own country believes your relationship does not legally exist and the country in which you married only hears divorce cases for its own people, a separation may involve a lot of legal trouble. Likewise, having your partner as next of kin or guardian of your children may be legally complicated or not recognised in some countries.\nAny of this may change rapidly in individual jurisdictions due to referenda, changes in local laws, or court cases making their way through multiple appeals. In some jurisdictions, same-sex couples have gained, lost, then regained the right to marry \u2013 sometimes causing a rush to registry offices as the situation may change on each appeal hearing, ending at a national supreme court.\nIf your plans are elaborate or may be difficult to change, be sure to consult the relevant authorities well before your wedding date.\n\n\nGet in\nIdentity documents can be awkward for transgender voyagers, as some national customs or immigration checkpoints blindly assume the traveller's birth sex, gender presentation and stated gender on passports and other travel documents will all conveniently match. Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they're carrying valid documents for their return trip. The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender not stated (X) or documents updated to match a desired name and gender varies. Willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is just as widely variable.\nSearches at security checkpoints have also become far more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era. Transgender and gender non-conforming people should be aware of increased risk of being searched, which can often be at best humiliating and uncomfortable, and at worst traumatic.\nThere is also the possibility that specific literature, pornography, adult novelty toys or other items will be blocked by customs when entering countries whose governments discriminate against LGBT persons.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Stonewall National Monument and Stonewall Inn, New York City, USA. The Stonewall Inn was the site of the Stonewall riots in 1969, a landmark moment in LGBT history.   \n2 Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism (Denkmal f\u00fcr die im Nationalsozialismus verfolgten Homosexuellen), Berlin, Germany. A cuboid made of concrete. On the front side of the cuboid is a window, through which visitors can see a short film of two kissing men. The video will be changed every two years and will also show kissing lesbians.   (updated Jul 2017)\n The Turing Mosaic, Milton Keynes, England, United Kingdom. A mosaic celebrating World War II codebreaker Alan Turing, and the only memorial thus far to acknowledge his life as a gay man. During Turing's life, homosexuality was illegal in Britain, and he was convicted and sentenced to chemical castration. In 2013 the government issued a posthumous pardon and apology, almost 60 years after his death by cyanide poisoning, widely believed to have been a suicide. \n3 Homomonument, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Believed to be the first public LGBTQ monument in the world, it was commissioned in 1979 and unveiled in 1987. Its \u20ac180,000 funding was raised largely through private donations, with \u20ac50,000 coming from the Dutch Parliament. The monument highlights the persecution faced by LGBTQ people in history and the path toward gay equality in the Netherlands.   (updated May 2020)\n\n\nDo\nCities of all sizes hold gay pride parades (or simply pride parades), festivals, and events.  Many of these are held in June to commemorate the Stonewall riots of June 28, 1969, one of the main events that led to the fight for LGBT rights in the U.S.  There is an up to date calendar of gay pride events all over the world.\n\n\nAfrica\n\nJohannesburg held the first Pride events on the African continent on 13 October 1990; Cape Town has also held Pride events sporadically since 1993. South Africa's post-apartheid 1996 Constitution provides for equality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, the only country on the continent to do so, but the original sense of Pride as political protest has not been lost. (Africa, Arabia and the Caribbean are among the worst regions on Earth for criminalising LGBT minorities. South Africa, while not free of de facto discrimination, officially seeks to make a clean break with its apartheid-era past.)\n\n\nAsia\nThe Manila Pride March is held annually every Dec in Manila.\n\n\nAustralia\nThe Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is held annually (Feb/Mar) in Sydney. (The Sydney Mardi Gras does not necessarily take place on Shrove Tuesday or the days leading up to it, as traditional Mardi Gras do.)\n\n\nEurope\n\nAmsterdam Gay Pride Canal Parade Held annually at the first Saturday of August in Amsterdam. The 2009 parade gathered 560,000 people.\nBrighton and Hove Pride Winter Pride in March and a Summer Festival Week at the end of July: probably the UK's best and most entertaining Pride festival\n Helsinki Pride (Helsinki, Finland). annually in late June. Helsinki Pride continues the tradition established by Finnish LGBT organization Seta's \"Freedom Day\" started in 1975. Finnish, Swedish and English speaking. \nMadrid Pride Week Europe's largest pride celebration attracting more than 1.5 million people. First week of July.\nParis Gay Pride Held every summer in the French capital with over 700,000 participants in 2007.\nSwedish Gay Camp A camp for gay and bisexual men held every summer in Sweden, open to international participants. Swedish and English speaking.\nSwansea Pride Parade. A large parade and festival in Wales. Annually, last Saturday in April.\n Dublin Pride Festival. Annual Pride celebration in Dublin, Ireland, on the last Saturday of June. (updated Jun 2023)\n\n\nNorth America\n\nPrideFest held each June At Henry Maier Festival Park in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, right on the lakefront. There are permanent restrooms, multiple stages, and even a chairlift over the entire festival\u01c3\nToronto Pride Week held annually (late June) in Toronto: one of the largest pride festivals in the world, attracting over one million people every year.\nThe San Francisco Celebration and Parade held annually in June in San Francisco.\nDivers/Cit\u00e9 is an annual LGBT multidisciplinary arts and music festival taking place each summer in the heart of Montr\u00e9al.\nThe White Party is held annually (November) in Miami as an HIV/AIDS fundraiser.\nPuerto Rico Pride, the annual gay pride event held in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nCarnival Week held annually in Provincetown each August.\nSouthern Decadence is a six-day annual LGBT event in New Orleans which concludes with a parade through the French Quarter on the Sunday before Labor Day.\nGay Days, an annual gathering in Orlando, Florida, with the primary focus visiting Walt Disney World the first weekend in June, but has since grown to events all over Orlando.\nBear Week Provincetown: one of the largest gatherings of bears and their admirers in North America. Held in mid-July each summer in Provincetown.\n Mexico City Pride March (Marcha del Orgullo LGBT de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico), Mexico City. Annual celebration and parade held in June. The event is one of the largest LGBT events in Latin America. (updated Mar 2024)\n\n\nSouth America\nRio Gay Pride, held annually in Rio de Janeiro in early October on Copacabana beach. Around one million people.\nThe LGBT Pride Parade in S\u00e3o Paulo held annually in early June, is the world's largest gay event. The 2017 parade gathered about 3 million people.\n\n\nSleep\nA same-sex couple asking for a double room (or explicitly for having a common bed) may not be well received everywhere, and may sometimes even be dangerous. Asking for twins is usually OK \u2013 hotel rooms are typically double-occupancy \u2013 and doubles may just be twins with the beds placed together.\nIn a few of the jurisdictions where same-sex activity is lawful, there are laws prohibiting private businesses from discriminating against gay (and, less often, transgender) patrons. Couples have successfully sued innkeepers who refused to let one bed/double occupancy rooms in the United Kingdom. Similar protections exist in much of western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and some liberal states and cities in the USA.\nConversely, a few destinations may have hotels which market specifically to the gay community or bed and breakfast hosts who are same-sex couples themselves.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nPublic toilets\nSee also: Toilets\nThe legality of using public toilets of one's gender identity differs greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some places gender-neutral toilets are common, which makes the issue go away. In more liberal states of the United States, such as California and New York, transgender persons are free to use public toilets of their choice by simply declaring their gender identity. In some other areas like Singapore and Thailand, transgender people may only use public toilets of their choice after undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Some areas, including most Middle Eastern Muslim countries, do not permit transgender people to change their legal gender at all, and thus in theory require all individuals to use public toilets of their legal birth sex \u2013 though a transgender woman in skirt with a male birth certificate may not be well received in the male toilet and vice versa. In practice, if your appearance conforms with the chosen toilet, few places will check your ID \u2013 or birth certificate.\n\n\nLGBT-friendly destinations\nThe following cities are considered LGBT-friendly destinations. Many host public gay events, have gay venues, and/or have active LGBT organizations. They're also considered to be hassle-free for gay travelers who are not seeking out specifically queer events/activities:\n\n\nAfrica\nThere are few good choices on this continent; many African governments continue to hunt homosexuals as criminals, and extreme homophobia continues to be very widespread among the general population. As a notable exception, South Africa has sought to break with this history by constitutionally prohibiting discrimination as part of a larger effort to sever ties to the country's apartheid-era past.\n\n\nCape Verde\nS\u00e3o Vicente\n\n\nSouth Africa\nCape Town \u2013 Easily the most liberal and gay-friendly city in South Africa, and considered the \"gay capital\" of Africa.  Gay nightlife centres around the Greenpoint district and holds the Mother City Queer Project (MCQP) every December.\n\n\nAsia\n\n\nBhutan\nThere are no laws against homosexuality in Bhutan, and violence against gays and lesbians is rare. Transgender people are accepted in urban areas, though will elicit stares in rural areas. Thimphu is the most LGBTQ-friendly place in the country.\n\n\nChina\nThere are no laws against homosexuality in China, and people are generally tolerant towards gays and lesbians with unprovoked violence being extremely rare. That said, homosexuality is not as well-accepted as in Western Europe, and openly displaying your sexual orientation is still likely to draw stares and whispers. Although there is censorship of homosexual-themed (or featured) media by the government, gay dramas are popular among young Chinese women. Shanghai Pride began in 2009 without a parade, due to fears that the government would not allow it. Same-sex marriage is not recognized by the government.\n\nShanghai \u2013 As expected of China's most cosmopolitan city, LGBT friendly by Chinese standards, and home to the first-ever Pride Festival in mainland China. Lucca 390 in Changning District is Shanghai's most popular gay bar, though it is also rather upscale and pricey. There is also a small concentration of gay bars and nightclubs located in the French Concession.\nBeijing \u2013 Not quite as progressive as Shanghai, but still safe for LGBT people. China's capital is now home to several gay bars and nightclubs, the most popular one being Destination Club in Sanlitun, though in general, the LGBT scene tends to be more discreet and subdued than in Shanghai.\nChengdu \u2013 Popularly regarded as the gay capital of China, the city has the highest percentage of LGBT individuals among China's major cities, and numerous bars and nightclubs catering to that crowd.\n\n\nHong Kong\nThere are no laws against homosexuality in Hong Kong although same-sex marriage is not officially recognised. In this conservative society sexuality is still generally not discussed in public. For youngsters it's quite different; there are some hip gay clubs that could well be in London, New York or Madrid that cater to locals and tourists, and the city held its first Gay Pride Parade in 2008. Anti-homosexual violence is virtually unheard of, and gay and lesbian couples should generally not run into any major issues.\n\n\nIsrael\nAttitudes vary between areas and subcultures. Same-sex marriages are recognised although not performed.\n\nTel Aviv \u2013 Israel's gay capital. An extremely lively and liberal city, with dozens of gay venues, parties and activities. Many locals are completely blas\u00e9 regarding sexual diversity.\n\n\nJapan\nThere are no laws against homosexuality in Japan, though same-sex relationships are also not recognised by the Japanese government. There is a growing movement towards legalisation and many cities and prefectures will offer a \"partnership oath\" to their LGBT citizens although these carry little legal weight. Acceptance of homosexuality among the Japanese public tends to be somewhat lower than in Western countries. That said, given Japan's low violent crime rate, homosexuals are extremely unlikely to encounter unprovoked violent attacks.\n\nTokyo \u2013 Shinjuku ni-chome is the largest gay district in the nation\nOsaka \u2013 Doyama-cho is Osaka's gay district\nSapporo \u2013 Home to a few gay establishments and its own annual Pride Parade. It has the largest gay community in northern Japan\nFukuoka \u2013 Kyushu's largest and most gay-friendly city; you'll find many of its gay venues in the Sumiyoshi ward\nNagoya \u2013 Sakae yon-chome in the Joshidai area is home to Nagoya's gay venues\n\n\nNepal\nNepal was the first nation in South Asia to decriminalize homosexuality. In 2011, the nation's tourism industry focused heavily on attracting gay tourism, trying to entice them with gay marriages on Mount Everest. In 2023, a one-judge bench of the Nepali Supreme Court issued a ruling legalising same-sex marriage in the country; while at least one couple was able to register their marriage, the government has yet to pass legislation explicitly allowing for marriage registration nationwide. The government is making moves to ensure that the police will enforce laws protecting homosexuals (and not discriminate themselves). Gay travellers in Nepal should still remain conservative; although the government is making changes, local attitudes about homosexuality remain negative and some resent being seen as a \"gay travel\" destination.\n\n\nPhilippines\nManila \u2013 Known as the gay capital of Asia. Most gay-friendly or LGBT-friendly destinations are found in the city and are owned by LGBT people themselves.\nCebu City \u2013 There are active LGBT organizations and gay-friendly restaurants and cafes in Cebu.\nCagayan de Oro\n\n\nSingapore\nMale homosexuality was legalised in January 2023, when the colonial-era law criminalising it was repealed, while female homosexuality has always been legal. However, same-sex marriage is not recognised by the government. Acceptance of homosexuality among the general public is mixed, with younger Western-educated people generally being more tolerant of homosexuality than their elders. Openly displaying your sexual orientation in public is likely to draw stares and whispers, though unprovoked violent attacks are almost unheard of. Gay bars are mostly concentrated in the Chinatown area.\n\n\nSouth Korea\nSouth Korea does not have any laws against homosexuality, though there is also no legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Same-sex relationships are not recognised by the South Korean government. Attitudes among the South Korean public tend to be negative, and Evangelical Christians in particular will likely strongly disapprove of it. That being said, your chance of encountering anti-homosexual violence is close to none.\n\n\nTaiwan\nAs far as East Asian countries go, Taiwan is considered to be one of the most gay-friendly areas. Taiwan does not have any laws against homosexuality, and became the first Asian country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2019. Anti-homosexual violence is extremely rare, and younger Taiwanese tend to be more accepting of homosexuality.\n\nTaipei \u2013 an annual gay parade event known as Taiwan Pride is held there between September and November\n\n\nThailand\nThailand is a long-established popular destination for LGBT tourism, and there are no laws against homosexuality. Same-sex marriage legislation has been passed and will be in effect from 22 January, 2025.\n\nBangkok \u2013 Known for its gay tolerance, and its gay festivals.\nChiang Mai \u2013 The heart of northern Thailand, much more relaxed than the capital, and held its first gay pride parade in 2019.\nPattaya \u2013 Many homosexual clubs and bars.\nPhuket \u2013 Popular in the transgender community for medical tourism as skilled practitioners offer sex reassignment surgery at a reasonable cost.\n\n\nVietnam\nNo laws against homosexuality have ever existed in Vietnam.\n\nHanoi \u2013 Hosted Vietnam's first gay pride parade in 2012.\nHo Chi Minh City \u2013 Has the largest and most visible LGBT community in Vietnam.\n\n\nEurope\nLikely the most relaxed about gay and lesbian travel and people should have few problems. Germany, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Britain, France, Spain and Portugal are likely the most accepting. Tolerance declines markedly as one goes further east. In Russia the spurious and ill-defined act of \"advocating homosexuality\" has been forbidden since 2022; this may include expressing your orientation in public.\nIbiza, Gran Canaria, Sitges (all in Spain) and Mykonos (Greece) are the hottest gay holiday destinations that Europe has to offer.\n\n\nAustria\nVienna\n\n\nBelgium\nAntwerp\nBrussels\n\n\nCzech Republic\nPrague\nBrno \u2013 Gibon and Philadelphia clubs.\n\n\nDenmark\nCopenhagen\n\n\nFinland\nLike elsewhere, LGBT acceptance has risen quickly. A former chairwoman of an LGBT rights association was president 2000\u20132012, Tom of Finland art is sold in flagship fashion shops, marriage law is gender neutral (since 2017) and explicitly gender neutral toilets are becoming common in some cities. Official Finland and a majority of the population have a very supportive or at least relaxed attitude on LGBT issues, though this does not mean acceptance everywhere.\n\nHelsinki (the capital) is the most LGBT-lively place in Finland. You can safely be openly gay, lesbian, bi or trans. The tourist office has info for LGBT folks. Both of the LGBT nightclubs in Helsinki are located just around one corner at Mannerheimintie and L\u00f6nnrotinkatu streets.\n\n\nFrance\nLyon\nMontpellier\nN\u00eemes\nParis \u2013 Over 300 different gay and lesbian venues, concentrated around Le Marais, in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements.\nProvence \u2013 Southern France brings gay travellers a new experience in travelling with the French gay and lesbian community in Provence sharing their love and knowledge of the country.\n\n\nGermany\n\nBerlin \u2013 Berlin has a pretty widespread gay community, mostly in Sch\u00f6neberg, but gay couples can be seen pretty much anywhere. The only places where caution should taken are Lichtenberg and Neuk\u00f6lln: historically not very tolerant groups live there; however, Neuk\u00f6lln is nowadays the new hip part of the city.  Near Kuf\u00fcrstendamm there are a lot of gay bars.\nHamburg \u2013 The gay heart of the city is called St. Georg with the famous \"Lange Reihe\" as the gay street in Hamburg. Also the \"Pulverfass\" has many gay or gay-friendly locations, e.g. bars, shops, restaurants and clubs. For a more sexual connotation visit the local red light district \"Reeperbahn\" and its many junctions, in particular the \"Talstra\u00dfe\" which is the other clearly \"gay-labelled\" street in Hamburg with gay cinemas, bars and clubs.\n\n\nGreece\nAthens\nMykonos\nLesvos\n\n\nHungary\nBudapest \u2013 Thermal bath and spa capital of Central Europe with a lively gay scene.\n\n\nIreland\nDublin\n\n\nIceland\nReykjavik (pop 200,000) holds a pride parade in early August, see Reykjavik#Festivals.\n\n\nItaly\nBologna \u2013 Widely recognised as the 'gay capital' of Italy.\nMilan \u2014 a safe haven for LGBT travellers, and a global centre of fashion, design, art and other creative disciplines\nRome\n\n\nNetherlands\nAmsterdam is known as the gay capital of Europe, although these days many other destinations are at least as gay friendly. Still, many clubs have special gay nights every week. An area known as Reguliersdwarsstraat, though quite modest in size, is full of caf\u00e9s where gay people are more common than heterosexuals. Every summer there is the Gay Pride Parade, taking place in the canals in the city centre.\n\n\nNorway\nOslo\n\n\nPoland\nWarsaw\n\n\nPortugal\nLisbon\n\n\nSpain\nBarcelona\nIbiza\nGran Canaria\nMadrid Has a famous gay quarter named \"Chueca\" with many bars, restaurants, clubs, discos and gay-catered business, although gay life is not restricted to that area. Madrid Pride Week is also famous worldwide and held the first week of July.\nPalma de Mallorca\nSitges\nTorremolinos\n\n\nSweden\nStockholm, see LGBT Stockholm\nG\u00f6teborg\nMalm\u00f6\n\n\nSwitzerland\nBern\nLausanne\nZ\u00fcrich\n\n\nTurkey\nIstanbul had a considerable gay life and tons of gay bars and clubs mainly around Taksim and Beyoglu districts. A big gay & lesbian parade (Pride Istanbul) ran from 2007 to 2014. The situation has deteriorated as a result of widespread crackdowns on free speech, journalism and dissent after a failed 2016 coup attempt. Public protest has been silenced; the Ankara governor\u2019s office imposed a ban on all LGBTI cultural events in 2017. Open threats of violence from ultra-nationalist groups also pose a risk.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe Big 3 are widely known as Brighton, London and Manchester. Same-sex marriage is legal throughout the United Kingdom and British law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nBirmingham \u2014 Has a large and vibrant gay scene and gay village in the Hurst  Street/China Town district of the city.\nBrighton \u2013 The highest percentage of gay people in Europe, with a lot of style, creativity, and great nightlife.\nCardiff \u2014 the most LGBTQ city in Wales.\nEdinburgh \u2013 One of the most tolerant cities in Europe. The second highest major city gay population outside London, after Manchester.\nHebden Bridge \u2014 a small town in West Yorkshire, has the highest proportion of lesbians in the UK.\nLeeds \u2014 The largest city in the North of England with a vibrant gay village centred around Lower Briggate and Leeds Bridge including cabarets, bars, clubs, shops and saunas.\nLondon \u2014 The second highest percentage of gay people in UK after Brighton, but given the massive size of the city, it's really second to none. Hundreds of clubs with different types of people and nationalities are waiting for you. The Soho area in particular is one of the world's most famous and vibrant gay districts. See LGBT London\nManchester \u2013 One of the gay party capitals with a huge amount of gay nightlife. The largest major city gay population outside London. Reportedly largest gay village in Europe.\nSheffield \u2014 Hosts numerous gay bars & clubs spread throughout the city centre.\nSwansea \u2014 large pride parade. Liberal attitude towards LGBTQ life-style.\n\n\nNorth America\nNorth America is a mixed bag when it comes to LGBT rights. While Canada and the more liberal parts of the United States are among the most LGBT-friendly destinations in the world, many of the Caribbean island nations can be hotbeds of homophobia.\n\n\nCanada\nFew countries are more tolerant and gay-friendly than Canada, both in legislation and attitude, including legal same-sex marriage. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation has been illegal since 1996, while discrimination of transgender people has been illegal since 2017. That said, not everyone has followed suit, particularly in rural and remote areas.\n\nToronto \u2014 see LGBT Toronto\nMontreal \u2014 North American city with a European flavour, very tolerant and multicultural. The large Gay Village is a place where everybody goes out to have a good time. There is an annual Pride parade in August.\nVancouver \u2014 third largest gay community on the west coast. The Davie Village in the West End is the centre of the gay community. The annual Pride Parade takes place on the first weekend in August.\nOttawa \u2014 One of the five largest Canadian metropolitan areas, yet Ottawa-Hull historically had a small-town mentality compared to its larger neighbour Montr\u00e9al (200km away), primarily as a result of its civil service heritage. No clearly-defined \"gay ghetto\", but there is an annual Capital Pride march (mid-August), various bars and an easily-recognisable cluster of gay-owned businesses in the \"Old Ottawa South\" section of Bank Street.\nEdmonton \u2014 A gay-friendly city with its own Pride Festival.\nSt. John's \u2014 has a small gay population but is one of the most tolerant cities in Canada and a great place to vacation; also holds gay pride events during the peak tourist times.\nMoncton \u2014 Moncton features New Brunswick's largest LGBT Pride Parade and Festival every summer. Downtown Moncton has one nightclub specifically for the LGBT community and the downtown area is incredibly tolerant and accepting of the LGBT community.\nHalifax \u2014 the gay-friendly capital of Nova Scotia and largest city in Atlantic Canada has many gay-friendly and gay-themed events throughout the year such as OUTeast Film Festival, Guerilla GayFare and Halifax Pride Parade. Halifax Pride is active in the community and hosts many events throughout the year.\n\n\nCosta Rica\nSan Jos\u00e9 (Costa Rica) This is the country's capital and where most of the population in Costa Rica lives. This place is filled with bars and discos for gay people.\nManuel Antonio, Costa Rica's favorite gay vacation spot for locals and tourists. One of the nicest beaches on the Pacific Ocean, declared a National Park for its amazing beauty.  Many gay-owned, friendly hotels and commerce. Great nightlife.\n\n\nMexico\nA largely Catholic country, Mexico is getting more gay-friendly all the time. Medium-sized and big cities as well as coastal resorts are usually very tolerant, most with clubs and bars that cater to the LGBT community.\n\nMexico City \u2013 This huge city offers a vast array of gay bars and clubs, from stylish and slick to unassuming and friendly, in the elegant Zona Rosa and other neighborhoods. The city hosts the annual Pride Week events in June. Mexico City was the first city in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage. See LGBT Mexico City.\nAcapulco \u2013 Apart from the natural beauty of the Quebrada divers, this party place has hectic night clubs, strip joints and friendly bars. Most of your fellow travellers are Mexican.\nPuerto Vallarta \u2013 Commonly considered one of the most gay-friendly destinations in Mexico. The area known as the South Side or Zona Rom\u00e1ntica in the southern part of the old city is the epicentre of gay nightlife and the popular gay beach, which consists largely of the Blue and Green chair restaurant/bar areas with their many palapas along Playa Los Muertos beach. The city hosts a Pride festival and parade each year in May.\nMerida \u2013 Travelers who want more culture than beach should check out Merida, which gaytravel.com calls \"the ultimate gay city destination in Mexico\" due to its colonial charm, proximity to Maya sites and its easy walkability.\n\n\nPuerto Rico\nSan Juan \u2013 the 500-year-old island capital of Puerto Rico and \u201cGay Capital of the Caribbean\u201d. San Juan is a definitively Latin American city and Spanish is predominant throughout the island. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory with border-free access from the mainland and direct air links to Canada and Europe. With gay guest houses, restaurants, beaches and nightlife in the Condado and Santurce areas, San Juan offers the Caribbean's best gay scene.\n\n\nUnited States\nBy and large the USA is tolerant-to-accepting of LGBT travellers, especially in the larger cities, college towns, the Northeast, the West Coast and Hawaii. However, due to strong evangelical influences in some areas, as a whole, the USA is not as gay-friendly as Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand or Canada. Acceptance of homosexuality varies greatly from region to region, and in areas where tourists are most likely to visit, acceptance is at least as good as in Western Europe. On the other hand, locals may not be as accepting of homosexuality in some more rural areas away from the tourist trail, where the majority of people continue to be deeply religious. Same-sex marriage has been legal nationwide since June 26, 2015 as a result of a Supreme Court decision. Laws preventing businesses from discriminating against LGBT people are however absent in states where acceptance is low.\nMajor destinations include:\n\n\nUS West\nPalm Springs \u2013 a small desert resort two hours east of Los Angeles, it has among the highest proportion of Gays and Lesbians in its population of any American city \u2013 also home to the annual White Party at Easter.\nSan Diego-Hillcrest \u2013 near downtown, Hillcrest is a vibrant community with the same no-attitude, relaxed atmosphere that defines San Diego\nSan Francisco \u2013 largely seen as the \"gay mecca\" of the USA; the Castro is one of the world's most famous gay neighborhoods.\nSeattle \u2013 with a large and well-integrated gay population, welcomes LGBT vacationers who like the perks of the great outdoors during the day and great restaurants and nightlife in the evening. Capital Hill neighborhood, west of downtown/Belltown, is known for being the LGBQT neighborhood of Seattle and the center of many LGBQT events and venues. Otherwise there is widespread acceptance throughout the city.\nWest Hollywood \u2013 in the heart of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.\nPortland - widespread acceptance throughout the city.\n\n\nUS Northeast\nBoston \u2013 the South End is the largest gay neighborhood, within reach of touristy attractions in the Back Bay and on the waterfront. Annual pride parade in June is the city's second largest festival after the Fourth of July.\nFire Island Pines and Cherry Grove \u2013 Two of the seventeen villages located on the Fire Island National Seashore (70 mi (110 km) from New York City) that are predominantly gay\nPhiladelphia \u2013 the \"City of Brotherly Love\" and the first destination in the world to create and air a television commercial specifically geared towards LGBT tourism, with a slogan \"Get your history straight and your nightlife gay.\" Many gay bars and other businesses can be found in Washington Square West.\nNew Hope, Pennsylvania \u2013 just outside Philadelphia; popular weekend getaway with a decidedly gay focus\nNew York City \u2013 Greenwich Village is the birthplace of the American gay rights movement; Chelsea is a centre of gay social life.\nNorthampton, Massachusetts \u2013 a lesbian mecca in Western Massachusetts, known for its art scene and surrounded by farms and mountains.\nOcean Grove, New Jersey \u2013 known as God's Square Mile, the Methodist resort is now a vacation resort and home to a diverse group of people.\nOgunquit, Maine on the Atlantic seacoast with cute bed & breakfasts\nProvincetown \u2013 at the tip of Cape Cod, \"P-Town\" has long been famous as a queer getaway; now that same-sex marriage is legal, it's a popular place to tie the knot\nRehoboth Beach \u2013 a small beach town on the Delaware coast with a large and active LGBT community\nWashington, D.C. \u2013 Dupont Circle and nearby Logan Circle are gay central in a very gay-friendly town, where you can subvert the national political culture, dancing the night away with gay Republican politicians and their staffers!\n\n\nUS Midwest\nChicago \u2013 has an annual Pride Parade in the Boystown neighbourhood, which includes some of the city's best clubs and bars. Nearby Andersonville is a centre of Chicago's lesbian community.\nSaugatuck, Michigan \u2013 small resort town with lots of LGBT friendly B&Bs, galleries, restaurants and shops next to Lake Michigan and popular with weekending Chicagoans\nMinneapolis \u2013 Hosts the Twin Cities Pride festival every summer, and has many gay bars.\nPine City \u2013 small resort town hosts East Central Minnesota Pride every June, and has a quaint downtown shopping district.\nColumbus - Capital of Ohio, most LGBT friendly city in Ohio with an annual pride festival.\n\n\nUS South\nAsheville \u2013 a city in western North Carolina with significant feminist and lesbian/gay communities.\nAtlanta \u2013 with lots of gay venues, this metropolis has grown rapidly by attracting people from across the South, gays included.\nAustin \u2013 very accepting, liberal city in Texas with lots of gay venues in the downtown area\nFt.

There is even a gay krewe at Mardi Gras\nVirginia has several cities that welcome LGBT travellers, including Alexandria, Arlington and Richmond.\n\n\nOceania\nAustralia and New Zealand are among the world's most LGBT-friendly destinations, with acceptance of LGBT people on par with Western Europe. On the other hand, most other countries in the region are strongly-conservative Christian moral societies, and thus tend to strongly disapprove of homosexuality.\n\n\nAustralia\nAustralia is a very safe destination for LGBT people. The majority of Australians are accepting of homosexuality, and acceptance is almost universal among the younger generation. Same-sex marriage was legalised on 12 December 2017 following the results of a nationwide postal ballot. Australian law also prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nAlice Springs \u2013 it's suggested that Alice Springs has the most LGBT people per capita in Australia \u2013 so it's truly a friendly place.  The area has several queer friendly accommodation establishments and is also home to the Alice is Wonderland festival \u2013 held just after the Sydney Mardi Gras.\nByron Bay \u2013 a small but popular city in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales that's earned the title for being the state's \"rainbow region\".\nSydney \u2013 host of the country's largest tourist event, the annual Sydney Mardi Gras, which attracts millions of queer-friendly visitors to the city every year. The majority of gay bars are located along Oxford Street in the CBD and in Newtown.\nMelbourne \u2013 a cultural hub of fantastic museums, art exhibits, and restaurants. The gay community is mostly centred in the suburbs of South Yarra and Prahran, which unsurprisingly is home to most of the gay nightclubs. Gay pubs, on the other hand, are largely concentrated in the areas of St Kilda and Fitzroy.\nBrisbane \u2013 while not as well-known as Sydney and Melbourne, Brisbane is also a gay-friendly city, with much of the LGBT community being concentrated in the suburbs of Fortitude Valley, New Farm, and Teneriffe.\nPerth \u2013 although there is no dedicated gay district, Perth is in general a gay-friendly city, with several gay nightclubs and bars located in the main nightlife area of Northbridge. The suburbs of Maylands and Bayswater are also known for their large number of LGBT residents.\nCairns \u2013 one of the best spots to see the Great Barrier Reef from, using one of the many gay-friendly local operators.\nAdelaide \u2013 although there is no gay district, by and large the general population is accepting of homosexuality, and the vast majority of bars and nightclubs are gay-friendly.\nNimbin \u2013 in a similar boat to Byron Bay.\n\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand is a gay-friendly destination, with same-sex marriage having been legalised since 19 August 2013. Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation has been illegal since 1993.\n\nAuckland \u2013 the city comes alive around 1AM, full of incredible restaurants, pubs with live music, and great dancing places in 'K Road'.\nVinegar Hill \u2013 a camping ground in the Manawatu that hosts a large gay and lesbian camp over Christmas/New Year.\n\n\nSouth America\n\n\nArgentina\nBuenos Aires \u2013 The Argentine capital is one of the most popular gay travel destinations in South America. The city passed same-sex civil union legislation in 2002 and the country legalized same-sex marriage in 2010.\n\n\nBrazil\nRio de Janeiro \u2013 Latin America's main gay destination, it was chosen as the sexiest gay destination in 2010 by TripOut Gay Travel Awards. In 2009 it was elected as the best lesbigay global destination. There is a famous gay beach. Acceptance of gay behaviour dates back to the 18th century. During colonial times the first gay ball of the Americas took place in Rio in 1757. Despite all this, many people in Rio are not tolerant of all aspects of LGBT behaviour outside the traditional venues of Ipanema and parts of Copacabana; same-sex displays of affection are likely to attract mocking whistles.\nS\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Home to the largest LGBT pride festival in the world, with some 3 million participants annually.\n\n\nChile\nSantiago \u2013 Santiago is by far Chile's least conservative city, the only one where the 'Gay parade' and similar events are held. But beware that gay people in Chile should keep a low profile: same-sex couples kissing in the street or holding hands (especially men) are going to attract stares, and, though homophobic physical attacks are somewhat unusual, there has been some unprovoked violence against gay couples.\n\n\nEcuador\nSame-sex marriage was legalized in 2019 and the country's two largest cities, Quito and Guayaquil, both have gay bars and clubs though you will find more nightlife in the former. Prostitution is legal and regulated for both heterosexuals and homosexuals. As the country is deeply Catholic, many still dislike LGBT individuals though harassment is very rare and many individuals incorporate native religious beliefs leading to a surprisingly tolerant culture. Significantly, public signs of affection of any significance between individuals of any gender or sexual orientation are generally frowned upon. The culture is very private, where there is acceptance but the subject is not directly talked about. Other safety concerns, especially knowing what taxis are 'safe', are more pressing. Keep your relationships quiet, but not restricted - this applies equally to heterosexual couples given the culture. Wedding bands are widely accepted, and are one way to demonstrate your relationship implicitly.\n\nQuito \u2013 Old Town is full of shops, restaurants and nightlife in the world's most intact colonial city. Outside of old town, other destinations for gay nightlife exist though be sure to ask about the safety of various neighborhoods as information online often doesn't keep up with changes (the tourist district is no longer a great destination due to high crime). Beyond explicitly LGBT attractions, Quito is the world's highest capital city at over 9,300 feet. Altitude sickness can be a problem during the first couple days so keep that in mind if planning to stay. Right outside the city are some of the most amazing natural attractions for nature lovers, including Mindo Cloud Forest and multiple active volcanoes, Cotopaxi being the most famous as the world's highest active volcano, that you can climb. Many tours can be found including those designed for LGBT individuals.\nGuayaquil - Whereas Quito is located in the highlands, Guayaquil is located on the Pacific Coast. Resorts can be found here, including ones that are LGBT friendly. There are many attractions in the city, though not as extensive or steeped in history as Quito. This is the primary location from which travelers will depart for the Galapagos Islands. Be aware that crime is higher here, and organized crime is a serious issue. Nearby Esmeraldas, though beautiful, is even more dangerous with the power of organized crime being extremely high.\n\n\nUruguay\nUruguay is the most LGBT-friendly country in South America. Uruguay has an especially liberal, inclusive and receptive culture. It was the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in the region and the only country in the Americas to legalize same-sex marriage entirely through legislation (2013), rather than through court decisions. Harassment is rare, even outside of the capital. Allowed to adopt, protected by anti-discrimination laws, LGBT inclusion throughout the military, legal protections for intersexual individuals, and the legal recognition of transgender rights (passed unanimously) all demonstrate that LGBT travelers will find Uruguay one of the safest places in the Americas.\n\nMontevideo \u2013 The Uruguayan capital had a sexual diversity monument installed in 2005. The city is home to a sizable number of gay bars and harassment is nearly non-existent. The city has unofficially come to be known as the most 'Gay Friendly City in the World'. One of the world's largest gay pride parades and celebrations takes place on the final Friday of September (spring in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\n\nSomewhat safe destinations\nCountries listed here may have vibrant LGBT scenes in certain parts, but the overall social attitude towards LGBT issues is not as accepting as the countries listed in the above sections. Some countries may still have anti-LGBT laws (either nationwide or in certain regions); others may not. LGBT travellers to these countries should be aware that, while they may be able to find gay culture in these countries, there still exist many more risks than in the places listed under the \"LGBT-friendly destinations\" section.\n\n\nAsia\n\n\nIndia\nWhile homosexual acts were decriminalized by a 2018 supreme court ruling after years of litigation, discrimination continues to exist in many rural villages. Generally, support for same-sex rights (including marriage) is rising.\n\nMuch gay activity was underground and focused on public cruising, but conventional scenes are quickly developing in cities such as Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai.\nOn June 29, 2008, four Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Pondicherry, and Kolkata) saw coordinated pride events, and on 16 August 2008 the gay community in Mumbai held its first ever formal parade.\nEngaging in public displays of affection for both the straight and the gay and lesbian community is met with strong rejection. If you are a gay/lesbian couple in the open as in many areas, laws do not tend to have such a positive effect.\nEven though India claims to be anti-homosexuality in political and religious aspects, public demonstrations of affection like holding hands or soft kissing are not penalized and are a very common practice between same sex members all over the country (it would be worse if they see you kissing or holding hands with someone of the opposite sex).\n\n\nIndonesia\nHomosexual acts are illegal in the province of Aceh, which is not safe for LGBT people.\nAlso in the rest of Indonesia, many still hold homophobic attitudes. With the passage of a law (in 2022?) criminalising extralegal sexual activities \u2013 Indonesian law does not recognise same-sex marriages \u2013 it has become much harder for Indonesian gays to live their lives.\nStill, there are gay scenes in Jakarta and Bali.\n\n\nKazakhstan\nHomosexual acts are not criminalized in Kazakhstan, but most of the society holds homophobic attitudes. Still, Almaty is the most gay-friendly and socially-progressive city in Central Asia, and many locals in the city speak proudly of the fact that there are gay bars there. Outside of Almaty (and even within the city with some residents), most people tend to hold conservative or homophobic views regarding sexuality. \n\n\nKyrgyzstan\nLike Kazakhstan, homosexuality is not criminalized in Kyrgyzstan, and there are a few gay bars in Bishkek. However, the government passed a law in 2024 criminalizing teaching about \"nontraditional\" lifestyles in schools, and those gay bars are subject to periodic police raids (usually on spurious notions like \"breaking fire code\"). \n\n\nMongolia\nHomosexuality has been legal since the fall of communism in Mongolia. Mongolian society is about evenly split between acceptance of LGBT issues, denial, and not caring about them. The Mongolian government is generally supportive of LGBT issues, and was one of the few Asian nations to vote in favor of the landmark 2011 UN Resolution on LGBT Issues. Ulaanbaatar has a growing LGBT scene, but it's nowhere near as open as LGBT scenes in cities like Amsterdam or Tokyo. Mongolian Buddhism, like most other versions of Buddhism, does not have any stance on same-sex marriage (or heterosexual marriage for that matter), so there is little religious-based homophobia in Mongolian society.\n\n\nTajikistan\nTajikistan is the only Persian-majority country where homosexuality is not criminalized. However, Tajik society is very conservative on that issue, so open displays of non-heterosexuality will be met with disapproval. There have been past instances of Tajiks beating up people who they know or suspect are gay, often with public support. Police sometimes use gay dating apps to entrap people, usually with the desire for a bribe. Unlike in neighboring Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan, there are no gay bars in Tajikistan. In 2024 the Tajik Parliament passed a bill criminalizing \"non-traditional\" dress, but failed to specify what that means. Critics of the bill fear that it will be used to target sexual minorities, such as transgender Tajiks.\n\n\nDangerous destinations\n\n\nCriminalization\nThe following countries have criminal laws against sexual acts between consenting adults of the same sex. Some countries impose life imprisonment or the death penalty for homosexual acts (as indicated in parentheses below).\nThis list covers just criminalisation of sexual activity; some nations prohibit or criminalise conduct such as cross-dressing (the distinction between transgender and homosexual is lost on a few less-accepting jurisdictions), serving alcohol to gays (as a tactic to shut down LGBT bars) or speaking out on gay and lesbian issues. Gay saunas in some locations are raided under laws intended to shut down houses of prostitution.\n\n\nAfrica\nHomosexual acts illegal: Algeria, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Mauritania (death penalty), Morocco, Nigeria (death penalty), Senegal, Somalia (death penalty), Sudan (death penalty), South Sudan (life imprisonment), Togo, Tunisia, Uganda (life imprisonment, death penalty for \"aggravated\" cases).\nMale only: Kenya, Sierra Leone (life imprisonment), Eswatini (Swaziland), Tanzania (except Zanzibar, where lesbian behaviors are also punishable) (life imprisonment), Zambia, Zimbabwe.\nNigeria and Uganda have enacted laws that make it a criminal offence for one to know that someone is homosexual and not report it to the police. A similar law is proposed for Kenya in 2023.\n\n\nAsia\nHomosexual acts illegal: Afghanistan (death penalty),  Bangladesh, Brunei (death by stoning), Malaysia (punishable from 2 to 20 years imprisonment or caning), Sri Lanka.\nHomosexual acts illegal, but law is generally not enforced: Pakistan (fine or 2\u201310 years of imprisonment for sexual orientation; vigilante action, including lynching, may cause death in some parts), Myanmar (punishable from 2 years to life imprisonment).\nMale only: Maldives, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.\nHomosexual acts illegal (for Muslims only) in one province of Indonesia: Aceh.\nIn Marawi City, Philippines there's a local ordinance forbidding cross-dressing and overtly feminine behaviour among men (bayut) enforced by the local religious police (but not the Philippine National Police) and the Philippines generally has a long history of tolerance and sympathy for queer folk.\n\n\nCentral and South America\nHomosexual acts illegal: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\nMale homosexual acts (\"buggery\") illegal: Guyana (life imprisonment), Jamaica, Grenada, Saint Lucia.\n\n\nMiddle East\nHomosexual acts illegal: Iran (death penalty), Iraq (executions ordered by non-state sharia courts and militias), Kuwait, Qatar (death penalty), Saudi Arabia (death penalty, can also be punishable with prison, fines or whipping), Syria, United Arab Emirates (death penalty), Yemen (death penalty).\nMale only: Gaza Strip.\nIn Oman homosexual acts are illegal, but practiced and talked about with discretion. The larger cities will be more liberal on this issue than the rural regions, but for the LGBT traveler, play it safe and treat homosexuality the same as you would in Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern nations.\n\n\nOceania\nHomosexual acts illegal: Samoa, Solomon Islands\nMale only: Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu\n\n\nHomophobia\nIn the following countries, LGBT acts aren't criminalised per se \u2013 other than in part of some of them \u2013 but they still pose significant problems to LGBT travellers (see also the \"Stay safe\" sections of region and city articles).\nIt is common in some countries for men and women to walk hand-in-hand with a same-sex friend without this meaning any sexual interest (ditto on hugging etc.). You might be tempted to do the same with your partner, but the difference may be difficult to hide.\n\nCayman Islands \u2013 in 2008, two men kissing caused one to be detained by an off-duty police officer for \"a public offence\". It turns out there is no law against homosexuality in CI \u2013 a British Overseas Territory \u2013 but homophobia there is endemic.\nHomophobia and discrimination are growing in much of the former Soviet Union, sometimes with tacit government support:\nWhile homosexual acts are not illegal in Russia, advocacy for LGBT rights is a criminal offence that carries a prison term with it. Discrimination is widespread and protests have been met with violence; the 2014 occupation of Crimea has extended these problems to that region. Arrests and multiple state-sanctioned murders have been reported in the Muslim-majority region of Chechnya.\nWhile homosexual acts are legal in Azerbaijan, discrimination against gays and lesbians is widespread.\nWhile homosexual acts are legal in Belarus, gays and lesbians may be subjected to harsh discrimination from the locals and from the authorities.\nKyrgyzstan police subject gay and bisexual men to \u201cphysical, sexual, and psychological violence; arbitrary detention; and extortion under the threat of violence,\u201d according to a January 2014 Human Rights Watch allegation, and that country's legislature is attempting to ban les/bi/gay advocacy and target foreign-backed NGOs in the same manner as Russia.\nWhile a court decision in Trinidad and Tobago decriminalised homosexual activity in 2018, this case is being appealed and gays may remain targets for violence or discrimination.\nThere have been reports of mass arrests in Indonesia in 2017. While homosexual acts are only illegal in part of the country (Aceh), police have been using other laws (such as laws targeting pornography) to attack gay saunas with the tacit support of local political leaders.\n\n\nSee also\nCrime\nGay Games\nLGBT-friendly beach resorts\nLGBT London\nLGBT Mexico City\nLGBT New York City\nLGBT Stockholm\nLGBT Toronto",
