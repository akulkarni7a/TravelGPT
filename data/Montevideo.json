  "extract": "Montevideo is the capital city of Uruguay, on the east bank of the Rio de la Plata. Though sometimes overlooked beside nearby Buenos Aires, Montevideo is the cultural and political center of the country. The city has a vibrant cultural scene, natural places, rich cuisine and historic neighborhoods, making it a cosmopolitan city with a nostalgic touch ideal for enjoying Uruguayan culture.\nIt was home to 1.3 million people in 2011, more than ten times the size of the next largest Uruguayan city. The metro area has around two million \u2014 half of the population of Uruguay \u2014 but the friendliness and helpfulness of the residents will make you think you're in a much smaller city.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nThere are several theories about the origins of the city's name. The \"monte\" part is generally considered to be the hill where the Cerro fort is now. According to one theory the hill was named \"Monte-VI-D-E-O(este)\", which translates to Mountain six (VI in Roman numerals) From East to West. Another popular theory is that a member of Ferdinand Magellan's world circumnavigation would have shouted \"Monte vide eu!\", which translates to \"I see a mountain!\" when seeing the hill \u2013 however, the circumnavigation happened two centuries before the foundation of the city so it might well have been another mountain he saw.\nConstruction of the Cerro fort, at the time called Montevieu fort, was started by the Portuguese in 1723. The following year the Spanish started building the city of Montevideo on the opposite side of the bay where Ciudad Vieja is now, and occupied and colonized the rest of the region. During its almost 300 years of existence, Montevideo has been part of the Spanish and Portuguese empires, occupied by the British for a few months in 1807 and afterwards a part of Brazil and today's Argentina before finally becoming the capital of the newly-founded Republic of Uruguay in 1828.\nThe unrest of the mid-19th century, including an eight-year siege, was followed by a time of prosperity, and the region was a popular destination for European immigrants. The pompous villas and parks that can be seen for example in the Prado district date from this period. In the 1950s, an economic collapse led to the emergence of a left-wing guerrilla movement, followed by a military dictatorship lasting until 1985, when democracy was restored. Today, Uruguay is run by the democratic socialist party of the former guerrillas, and it is one of the safest Latin American countries with the GDP per capita being among the highest.\n\n\nClimate\n\nSince Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30\u00b0C are common during the day, but nights are often chill. The winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the strong winds wind and high humidity combine to reduce apparent temperature. There are no particular \"rainy\" and \"dry\" seasons: the average rainfall is similar throughout the year.\nAfter it rains, loose sidewalk tiles can hide puddles of dirty water. Watch your step to avoid getting splashed.\n\n\nOrientation\n\n\nCentral areas\nThe city of Montevideo extends from the extreme southeast of Rio de la Plata along a circular gulf that offers a natural harbor.\nThe most interesting area for visitors is the old town (Ciudad Vieja) and Centro. The city's major sights, monuments and museums but also accommodation, theater and shops can be found there. The old town stretches along a small peninsula that abuts Montevideo Bay and the Centro immediately to the east.\nAvenida 18 de Julio starts at Plaza Independencia, dominated by Palacio Salvo, an Art Deco highrise of 102 m that is considered the symbol of Montevideo. Another point of interest in the old town is Plaza Constituci\u00f3n, colloquially named Plaza Matriz. Another sight is the former city hall palace (El Cabildo).\nTowards the north of the old town one can find architecture reminiscent of Buenos Aires, and in the south it is delimited by the seaside promenade La Rambla that continues all the way to Parque Rod\u00f3. This is a popular area for outdoor activities like fishing, strolling or biking.\n\nBarrio La Aguada is an extension of the Centro towards north whose major point of interest is the parliament, built in neoclassical style.\nBarrio Tres Cruces is an important traffic center in the other end of Avenida 18 de Julio. The intercity and international bus station is there, together with a big shopping mall.\n\n\nEastern and Southern Montevideo\n\nThe coast east of Parque Rod\u00f3 is known for its beaches. Its principal artery is Avenida Italia, a lively road connecting the city to the airport. The Rambla runs along the coast. The most important districts in this part of the city are:\n\nBarrio Sur - A district associated with candombe and the Afro-Uruguayan community.\nPunta Carretas \u2013 Upscale district includes golf greens and Hotel Sheraton and Punta Carretas Shopping, a major shopping mall that is built on the remains of a prison (they preserved the prison gate inside the mall).\nPocitos - This barrio lies about 3 km south-east of the city center. The Pocitos beach runs east from Punta Trouville for about 1.5 km. Highrise apartments ring the beach along the Rambla, but going inland a few blocks brings you into an older neighborhood reminiscent of San Francisco's Marina district.\nBuceo - East along the Rambla, home to one of the city's many beaches and the World Trade Center with its adjacent shopping mall.\nMalv\u00edn - Yet another upscale barrio with a long beach.\nCarrasco - Very upscale district with a variety of architectural styles in the easternmost part of the city.\n\n\nNorthern and western Montevideo\nThe northern and western parts include a couple of sights. The few dangerous barrios of Montevideo are in the northwestern outskirts.\n\nBarrio Reus \u2013 A small neighbourhood with charming colorful houses.\nPe\u00f1arol - The name of the world-famous football team, and a well-preserved railway district among the oldest in South America.\nCerro - Seedy neighborhood best known for its fort overlooking Montevideo from the western side of the bay.\n\n\nVisitor information\nDiscover Montevideo website\n\n\nGet in\nMontevideo is on the north bank of the Rio de la Plata.\n\n\nBy plane\n\n1 Carrasco International Airport (MVD  IATA) (about 15 km east of the city center). There are flights to the airport from major South American cities as well as Panama City, Miami and Madrid.   \nFrom the airport there are two kinds of buses to central Montevideo. Public transit buses travel from the airport to the 2 Rio Branco Terminal (Terminal Baltasar Brum), a few blocks north of Plaza Independencia. The bus stop is right out the airport to the left where a big bus sign is visible. Take any bus showing \"Montevideo\"\u2014all go into the centre. They go every 10-20 min, take 1-1.5 hr and tickets are U$59. You can get off at any stop before the station in case you have an accommodation somewhere between Pocitos and Cord\u00f3n.\nThe second type of bus transportation is the intercity coaches, travelling eastbound to places like Punta del Este, or travelling westbound into the city. The westbound buses will take you to Tres Cruces bus station east of the city centre. A one-way ticket into the city on the COT line costs U$134 (Uruguayan pesos). As you exit the terminal, walk to the right, buy a ticket in the COT office (or you can buy it on board the bus) and walk further 20 m forwards, where the stop for those buses is. Since both eastbound and westbound intercity buses stop at the airport, be sure to check that you're getting on a bus going in the right direction.\nA private company also offers airport taxi service for a hair-raising US$60. That same company ostensibly offers a shuttle service that will run when enough passengers buy tickets. However, with the same company offering both services and the margins on the taxis service being much more profitable, the shuttle service is, surprisingly, never available.\nExchanging money at the airport is notoriously expensive, with rates about 20% off the official interbank rates. So, better to opt for a \"cambio\" in the city centre, where rates are just about 3 % off.\n\n\nBy ferry\nAnother possibility for travelers who are heading to Montevideo from nearby Buenos Aires is to take the high-speed ferry operated by Buquebus. A one-way ticket, tourist class, costs about ARS 90,000 if booked at least a month in advance and takes about 2.5 hr. There are several boats a day. The ferry arrives in the 3 Ciudad Vieja district of Montevideo, situated very close to downtown - a cab ride to a hotel in El Centro or Pocitos is much shorter and cheaper than from the airport.\nFerry service from Buenos Aires is also available via the same company Buquebus via Colonia. The ticket can include the bus to Montevideo from Colonia. This route is cheaper and about 1-2 hr longer than the direct crossing. The crossing from Buenos Aires to Colonia by fast ferry takes about one hour. The city of Colonia itself with its old buildings is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and certainly worth visiting. The bus ride from there to Montevideo's main bus terminal takes 2-3 hr and bus tickets cost around U$188. One traveler paid U$179 one-way to Colonia, about 2-3 hr. Efficient and on time.\nGrimaldi Lines offers transport by freighter from European ports, the journey taking several weeks. Montevideo is occasionally also visited by cruise ships.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n4 Tres Cruces Terminal (the station is connected to the old town by the normal bus lines 180 and 188, and cheaper line CA1, among others). This is the city's central terminal, named after the district it is in. Aside from being a full-fledged mall, it sports companies with fully-equipped buses that can take you anywhere in Uruguay and even into neighbouring countries. All destinations, timetables and hours are also available online. They have an excellent tourist office there as well. (updated Jan 2018)\nLike the rest of Latin America, overland transportation is in practice synonymous with taking the bus. There are frequent buses to and from all main cities in Uruguay and from destinations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Paraguay.\nIf you arrive in Tres Cruces Terminal and plan to use public transit, take the opportunity to make your free STM card at the Abitab shop on the terminal floor, as this will save you money on the bus fares.\n\n\nTo Brazil\nTwo companies operate the route Montevideo/Porto Alegre: EGA and TTL, both offer executivo and leito/cama class of buses (US$ 90-100 each way). TTL Brazil sells tickets online, and EGA Brazil sells them over the phone. It's also possible to get an open-date refundable ticket valid for one year if you buy it in Brazil.\nA cheaper service is to travel to the border town of Chuy on the Uruguayan side (many companies, 5 hours, US$ 25 each way), walk a few blocks and cross into the town of Chu\u00ed on the Brazilian side and catch a Planalto bus to Porto Alegre (2 services a day at 12:00 and 22:00, 8 hours, US$ 35-70 each way).\n(Chu\u00ed-Porto Alegre tickets can only be bought in person at the Chu\u00ed bus station, but the timetable and prices are the same in both directions, so check updated information on Busca \u00d4nibus or other search engines)\n\n\nBy car\nIf you are driving into central Montevideo, be aware that many hotels do not have their own parking spaces and it can be challenging finding somewhere to park. Parking houses in the city charge per hour and long term parking is generally expensive. They also do not take responsibility for the cars parked there.\nFor those leaving from Porto Alegre, Brazil, there are two options: one that enters Uruguay via Chu\u00ed and another via Jaguar\u00e3o. For both, you start by taking the route BR-116 up to Pelotas. Next, if you want to visit Chu\u00ed, the southernmost city of Brazil, or the Santa Teresa Fortress or even see the beautiful beaches of the coast of Uruguay, then, at Pelotas, take the route BR-392 to Rio Grande and next the route BR-471 all the way to Chu\u00ed. Takes about 6 hours and 30 minutes to go from Porto Alegre to Chu\u00ed. as of 2010 there were 5 tolls between those cities, a total of R$34.60, and they only accept Brazilian reais). Around 30 minutes after crossing the border, you can visit the Santa Teresa Fortress. An option is to stay a night at Punta del Diablo, in case you are too tired to keep driving to Montevideo. From Chu\u00ed to Montevideo, just stay on route 9. It takes about 4 hours and 30 minutes. Again, there are three tolls between Chu\u00ed and Montevideo, each cost U$45. In this case, they do accept foreign money. However, it's strongly recommended that you pay in Uruguayan pesos, as they charge a lot more if you pay in reals or dollars.\nIf you want the fastest route to Montevideo (about 2 hours shorter than the first one), you should cross the border at Jaguar\u00e3o. To reach this city, just stay in route BR-116. After that, take route 8 to Montevideo.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\n\nBuses are the only form of mass public transit available in town, so it's likely you'll use them at some point.\nSTM transit cards are free, give discounts on the many types of fares and allow for buses integration: U$29 for 2 buses in 1 hr or U$44 for any number of buses in 2 hr, against U$36 for the normal fare paid in cash. You can get yours at the Abitab shop on the ground floor of Tres Cruces Terminal, or in any other agreed post. Abitab minimal top-up is of U$100.\nBe aware that there are no route maps at the bus stops, that the lines deserving a certain stop might not be indicated, and that the bus stop might not have any mark at all.\nThere are a few routing tools to help with the task of figuring out the bus system: Moovit app is a traveller's favorite because it's available in many other cities around the globe and has an intuitive interface in many languages (most notably English, Portuguese and Spanish) and C\u00f3mo ir is the official app launched by the Montevideo Administration. Other options are MontevideoBus and Bondi.\nMontevideo buses are entered through the front door. The fee is paid either to the driver or to the collector (if present) sat to the right. There are many types of tickets available and you are supposed to say which one you want: if you don't know, say una-hora. Remember to take the receipt and keep it with you for the duration of your trip because control officers might board the bus and ask for them. In many buses, the \"please stop\" button is over the doors - observe others if in doubt.\nNotice that the line CA1, which connects Tres Cruces Terminal to Ciudad Vieja, is exceptionally included on the \"boleto c\u00e9ntrico\" type of fare, so it's cheaper: U$20 if paid by card, U$26 if in cash (against U$29/36 for other lines on the same route).\n\n\nOn foot\n\nMontevideo is a relatively safe city and if you are getting around by foot, you will have time to see the beautiful architecture of Montevideo. The city is built on a slight hill, the spine of which extends into the Rio de la Plata to create the point that was the original city (Ciudad Vieja). From the Plaza de la Independencia, the main street that extends east from the plaza is 18 de Julio Ave. El Centro (downtown) is in this area and there will be lots of shops and places to change money.\nIf you are arriving at the central bus station you can walk south along General Artigas until Parque Rodo looking at old buildings. From there you can walk east along the beach promenade which reminds of Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro. Another alternative is to walk east from the bus terminal to Parque Batlle and its Est\u00e1dio Centen\u00e1rio - the home of Uruguay's football team and site of the 1930 FIFA World Cup. A third alternative is to walk towards the city center and the old town along 18 de Julio, it's around 4 km to Plaza Independencia.\nSeparate traffic lights for pedestrians are rare, in general there is just one traffic light for all traffic. Jaywalking and crossing the street outside of zebra crossings is very common. Cars are fairly respectful of pedestrians especially in the old town and elsewhere where they drive slowly. On the other hand, you're not in Northern Europe, and at the Rambla where highway speeds seem to be common, stepping out in the front of cars is an utterly bad idea!\nYou can walk around without worry almost anywhere, and there are lots of side streets and areas you can explore: be aware that the port area, just off the main tourist and port terminal areas, is considered dangerous by locals as much as by the police. Parts of the city may appear run-down, but do not confuse this with it being a bad neighborhood. Along with Buenos Aires, this is one of the few cities in South America where poverty is not overly prevalent. That being said, there is simply not enough money in Uruguay to construct lots of new, modern buildings, so buildings are kept in use for long periods of time.\n\n\nBy taxi\n\nTaxis are plentiful but not too cheap. It helps to know a little Spanish. A ten-minute cab ride costs about U$100. Taxis are metered and upon the end of your ride you are shown a chart depicting distance and cost (though on some vehicles this chart will be on the window between you and the driver). Generally there are two fare schedules. The first is for Monday-Saturday from morning to mid-evening. The second fee schedule is for Sundays and late at night, and is slightly more expensive. Tipping is not expected, but you might round up to an even number to be polite. It is also not uncommon to sit in the front.\nIf you are interested in a more private and secure option, you can hire a Transfer Service. This service works with prior recruitment, often has a wide range of vehicles, and can be paid by credit card.\nIf you can, take an Uber instead\u2014they're more popular, cheaper, and safer.\n\n\nBy car\nCar rental is cheaper if booked ahead but be aware that places like the airport and the ferry terminal charge higher rates then the same agencies in other locations around the city. A few phone calls and a cheap taxi ride to a location other than the air or sea ports will save you half the rate for the same car at the same company. Gasoline costs around US$2 per litre. If moving around by car, be aware that signs and lane markings are often poor or non existent, and it's hard to see how many lanes the street really has. Drivers often yield to pedestrians, and you should not drive to close to the car in front of you as it, even while driving at high speed, might suddenly brake to let a pedestrian cross. Gas stations and their mini markets do not handle cash and only accept credit cards at night.\n\n\nBy train\nThere's no rail traffic in the city itself. Administraci\u00f3n de Ferrocarriles del Estado\u00e4 (AFE) operates local trains from suburbs and towns northwest of Montevideo in the departments of Canelones, San Jos\u00e9 and Florida.\n\n5 Montevideo central station (Estaci\u00f3n Central). Trains arrives at a terminal about 500 m north of the majestic former central station, Estaci\u00f3n Central General Artigas, that was abandoned in 2003. (updated Mar 2020)\n\n\nBy bicycle\nLess windy days are good for bike rides along the beach promenade. If something on your bike breaks, head for one of the Bicipuntos service points. Most city streets do not have designated bike lanes, so cycling around can be challenging, especially on weekdays. However a bike is a good way for getting around the parks in and around the city.\nBikes can be rented at reasonable rates at some hostels and at Plaza Matriz in the old town.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nPlaza Independencia\n\nThe Independence square is a symbol of Montevideo and lined by several prominent landmarks.\n\n1 Plaza Independencia. The square at the end of 18 de Julio Ave., with the latter being the main commercial artery of the city. On the last Saturday of September, all the museums and historical places of interest around the Plaza Independencia open for free to the public. There is also a large \"Murga,\" or a traditional South American parade in which all the Uruguayan political parties take part. The event is known as El D\u00eda del Patrimonio, the Day of Heritage. On the middle of the square there is a statue of general Jos\u00e9 Artigas, and under it, his mausoleum.   (updated Jul 2015)\n2 Palacio Salvo. Eastern side of Plaza Independencia. Once South America's highest building, the 95-m-high Art Deco building Palacio Salvo still dominates Montevideo's skyline. In the past there used to be an observation deck that could be accessed for free. U$200-300 for 30-min tour including observation deck.   (updated Jan 2018)\n3 Mausoleo de Artigas. This large monument in the Plaza Independencia pays tribute to Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, one of the heroes of the Uruguayan Independence. Under the monument is the mausoleum, which is open on the weekends. It contains an urn with his ashes and two honor guards keeping watch.   \n4 Palacio Est\u00e9vez (Est\u00e9vez Palace). The Palacio Est\u00e9vez was the office building of Uruguayan presidents until 1985. Today it is a museum of the Uruguayan presidency.   \n5 Torre Ejecutiva. The current presidential office, next to the former. The Executive Tower was first planned as a courthouse in the 1960s, the project was halted several times until the house was finalized as the presidential office in 2009.   \n6 Edificio Ciudadela. Glass-framed office building at the western end of the square with a terrifying number of air conditioning units.  \n7 Puerta de la Ciudadela. A gate to the old town; if you pass through it you're at Sarand\u00ed, Montevideo's main pedestrian street. This is one of the few remaining parts of the old city wall.   \n8 Museo del Tango de Montevideo (Tango Museum of Montevideo), Plaza Indepepndencia 846 (on the main square of Montevideo. Plaza Independencia. Palacio Salvo. Ground floor), \u260f +598 93 416 202, lacumparsita@lacumparsita.com.uy. The historic place of Tango music in Uruguay. It is the place where La Cumparsita, the Tango of all Tangos was first played 100 years ago, in 1917. It conserves the original pieces of the time, and a large collection of Uruguayan Tango history. Working victrols play tango all day long on original records. It is one of the most visited sites in Montevideo. (updated Jun 2018)\n\n\nCiudad Vieja\nProbably half of what Montevideo has to offer visitors is concentrated in the area immediately west of Plaza Independecia \u2014 the old town.\n\n\nBuildings and monuments\n\n9 Mercado del Puerto. This is a covered market full of restaurants and some shops selling handicrafts and souvenirs that is worth seeing as a sight, an eating place, and as a place for shopping. The main market is open every day during lunch hours. The restaurants around the exterior offer indoor and outdoor seating, and they remain open for dinner.  \n10 Catedral Metropolitana (Montevideo Metropolitan Cathedral), Plaza Constituci\u00f3n/Plaza Matriz.

Synagogue in the old town that was opened in 1956. It was inspired by the Portuguese synagogue in New York.   \n12 Teatro Sol\u00eds, Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre. The main theater of Montevideo \u2014 consider going here if you want to see a theater performance. It hosts a museum of its own history and is one of the old town's most iconic buildings.   \n13 The sexual diversity monument (on Policia Vieja St., between Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n and Plaza Independencia). Basically, a work of modern art, graffiti painted fences and walls, all at a side alley that should probably be avoided after dusk. It reads \"Honouring diversity is honouring life; Montevideo is for the respect of all identities and sexual orientations\" and was erected in 2005. It's South America's first monument dedicated to sexual diversity. Other places of interest to gay people include the Edificio Liberaij, where two gay Argentine bank robbers (featured in the 1998 movie Plata Quemada) died in 1965.   \n14 Aduana building. Massive landmark next to Mercado del Puerto, hosting the Uruguayan customs administration. \n15 Cathedral of The Most Holy Trinity (Templo Ingl\u00e9s).

The ones near Plaza Independencia are of high standard and popular among foreign dignitaries.

The view from the windows is not too wonderful, however. The price for the breakfast buffet is rather steep (US$16), so if it is not included in your room price you would probably be better off having breakfast at some nearby caf\u00e9 instead. As of May 2014 the pool and the gym are under renovation. Wi-Fi is available in some of the rooms as well as in the conference center. rates from US$134. \n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nSecurity\nMontevideo used to be safer before, however it is still a safe city compared to e.g. Brazilian cities. Pickpocketing occurs downtown so backpacks and handbags should preferably be worn so that you can see them. Robberies are known to happen, including \"smash and grab\" attacks where the robber smashes a car window, grabs a bag or other item from the seat, and runs.\nThe most secure neighbourhoods, according to a report from a realtor magazine, are Buceo, Pocitos, Punta Carretas and Parque Rod\u00f3, followed by Col\u00f3n, the downtown, Sayago and Conciliaci\u00f3n.\nThe old town outside the pedestrian area is considered dangerous after dark. This also applies to the beach promenade outside the old town. In the daytime there are frequent police patrols on old town's streets and many establishments have security guards standing outside the door. In the summer the beaches of Ram\u00edrez and Pocitos should be avoided at nighttime.\nIf you are an obvious foreigner you are more frequently targeted by beggars. However they aren't violent. Near attractions there are often people presenting themselves as \"keepers\" that allegedly will look after your parked car for a fee. Unlike in other places they reportedly don't ask for payment in advance and don't behave in an intimidating way.\nTourists are advised not to visit certain peripheral suburb neighbourhoods known for being sources of insecurity, such as 40 semanas, Barrio Borro, or the outskirts of Casab\u00f3. Although some of them are not slums at all, the level of crimes is higher than the downtown or the suburbs. The Cerro district west of the bay, famous for its fort, is also reportedly one of the districts you should not be wandering around in as a tourist and absolutely not alone, specially at night.\nThe police can be called by dialing 911.\n\n\nDrugs\nLike elsewhere in Uruguay, driving with any blood alcohol level greater than 0 is prohibited. Do not drive under the effects of alcohol. Also in Montevideo as well as the rest of the country, smoking is prohibited in public enclosed spaces. Violation of this policy may carry fines.\nRegarding the legality of marijuana, possession for personal use is not penalized if it concerns minor quantities (a few grams). Possession of major quantities is illegal and punishable by law. Remember that the legalization of this drug in 2013 as for the personal use (medicinal or recreational), sale or storage of the plant (~480 grams per year) is only for Uruguayan citizens of 18 years and above (natural or legal citizenship) with legal capacity. Likewise with alcohol, driving under the influence of marijuana is not allowed, and such breach may carry a fine.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\nThe city has several public and private hospitals, with a cluster of them in the area around Tres Cruces bus terminal. Among the publics, there are:\n\n1 Hospital Maciel, 25 de Mayo 174 (in the Old Town, near the Mercado del Puerto), \u260f +598 2915 3000, direccion.maciel@asse.com.uy.   \n2 Hospital Pereira Rossell, Bv. Artigas 1550 (ambulance entrance), Lord Ponsonby W/N (public entrance), \u260f +598 2708 7741 (to 44), pereirarossell@pereirarossell.gub.uy. Hospital for women and children.   \n3 Hospital Pasteur, Larravide W/N between Asilo and J. A. Cabrera, \u260f +598 2508 8131 (Int. 130). \n4 Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas, Avenida Italia W/N (Near the Estadio Centenario), \u260f +598 2487 1515. Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica's university hospital.   \nAmong the private institutions, there are: British Hospital, Italian Hospital, M\u00e9dica Uruguaya, Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, and some other minor ones. Also, there are many policl\u00ednicas (medical consultories) for minor cases around the city. The Hospital Policial and Hospital Militar are for the police and the armed forces respectively \u2014 these are not open to the public.\nThe emergency number is 104.\n\n\nConnect\nWireless Internet is popular and can be found at Carrasco Airport, Tres Cruces bus terminal, most hotels and many restaurants and bars (usually they are advertising it with a sticker in the window). Many of them are free to use and reportedly connections are fast and reliable enough for Skype communication. Some public parks also advertise Wi-Fi availability, and so do most public schools.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nGeneral\n Firefighters (emergencies), Colonia 1665 (headquarters), toll-free: 104. \n Police (emergencies), toll-free: 911. \n\n\nEmbassies\n  Argentina, Cuareim 1470, \u260f +598 2902 8166, fax: +598 2900 8408, eurug@mrecic.gov.ar. \n  Bolivia, Prudencio de Pena 2469 (between Cambell st. and Ponce st.), \u260f +598 2708 3573, fax: +598 2708 0066, embouy@adinet.com.uy. \n  Brazil, Bulevar Jos\u00e9 G.
