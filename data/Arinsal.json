  "extract": "Arinsal is a village in Andorra, a small mountainous country in the Pyrenees mountains at the head of a valley. The old village part is clearly evident, but because it is also a ski resort it has grown a lot and has quite a number of hotels catering to this trade. As a result though outside the ski season the place is pretty much closed up including some of the bars and restaurants.\nThis resort is very popular with English-speaking skiers.\n\n\nGet in\nThe main road up from La Massana which itself is up from Andorra La Vella.\n\n\nGet around\nThere is a bus service between Arinsal and Andorra La Vella, passing through La Massana. It is not very regular so it is worth checking the timetable before planning any trips. The cost is reasonable.\nThe road continues up out of the village and stops about another 1 or 2 up at another hotel. Then there is a semi-private road that winds up the mountain for about 4.5-6 km (3-4 miles) to the top station of the cable car lift.\n\n\nSee\n\nThere is great mountain scenery all around and it is a really good location for starting out on any hiking or climbing trip.\nThe highest mountain Pic de Coma Pedrosa in Andorra at 2942 metres (9,665 ft) is located in this area.\n\n\nDo\nDuring the ski season which is approximately December to March or so, you can go skiing. There is a cable car up to the Arinsal ski area which is in the centre of the village. Arinsal and nearby Pal offer good skiing for the novice and the intermediate skier, and first time skiers often head for Arinsal and Palfor their first holiday or two before heading for Soldeu and Pas de la Casa. Arinsal is a little different from Soldeu and Pas de la Casa too in that it has quite a few full-time residents and the villages are 'year round' while the others are fairly seasonal. For this reason Arinsal and Pal can be the perfect answer to those who are embarking on their first ski holiday as there is more than just skiing, Ordino and her first class sports centre is easily accessed for example, and if you decide skiing isn\u2019t for you, you do have other choices too.
