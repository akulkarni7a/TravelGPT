  "extract": "Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, is one of the largest and most important cities on the northeastern coast of Brazil. This lively capital, founded by Dutch colonizers, is brimming with a vibrant culture, an interesting old town (which includes the oldest synagogue in the Americas) and some nice beaches.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nRecife (Portuguese: \"The Reef\") is on the Atlantic coast, at the estuary of the Capibaribe, Beberibe and Jord\u00e3o Rivers, close to the easternmost point of the Americas. The city, which is only two meters above sea level (some parts are below), is distributed across rivers, canals and islands. \nDue to the prevalence of waterways in its geography, Recife is known as Veneza Brasileira (Brazilian Venice). Its 1.7 million inhabitants (2020), 3.7 million in the Grande Recife, are called recifenses. Services are the base of the economy. Despite the high incidence of poverty, the municipal Human Development Index (HDI) in 2000 (0.810) was above Brazil's national average (0.800). Recife is famous for its beaches, history, Carnaval, arts and cuisine.\n\n\nOrientation\nThe city can be roughly divided in four major areas:\n\nThe Centro (Center) is composed of the neighborhoods of Recife Antigo (Old Recife), Santo Ant\u00f4nio, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Santo Amaro and Boa Vista, which are scattered through a couple of islands and part of the mainland.  They are connected to each other by a series of bridges over the Capibaribe River.  The Centro contains most of the historic and government buildings in the city.  The port, which is in Recife Antigo, was once the most active in all of the Americas.\nZona Sul (South Zone) is the most modern and touristic part of the city, as it was built around the beautiful natural reef beaches that gave the city its name.  This area has a great many hotels, restaurants, bars, the airport, and the largest shopping mall.  Its most important neighborhood is Boa Viagem, set along the beautiful Boa Viagem beach. Because of the beach and the skyline Boa Viagem is also called the Copacabana of the North East.\nZona Oeste (West Zone) is by far the greenest part of the city.  It contains remnants of the Atlantic Forest that once covered most of the Brazilian eastern coast.  It contains two famous museums (Instituto Ricardo Brennand and Museu-Oficina Francisco Brennand), as well as the Federal University of Pernambuco, and the Recife Military school (2nd best school around all Brazil).\nZona Norte (North Zone) is mostly a residential area.  Throughout the centuries, the neighborhoods along the Capibaribe River were home to the local aristocracy.  It contains the city's best schools and hospitals, and is also famous for its parks and bars.\nThe term Grande Recife is used to describe the Metropolitan Region of Recife, the fifth largest urban agglomeration in Brazil (after S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre) and the single largest in the Northeast.  Grande Recife offers superb touristic attractions inside and outside the city limits.  Do not miss Olinda or Porto de Galinhas.  The first is famous for its natural setting, colonial architecture and carnaval, while the second has been consistently voted the best beach in Brazil.  Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Itamarac\u00e1 Island and Igarassu are known for their beautiful beaches and important historical monuments.\n\n\nHistory\n\nA collection of fishing shacks, inns and warehouses started on the delta between the Capibaribe and Beberibe rivers in the captaincy of Pernambuco, sometime between 1535 and 1537, at the long reef (actually a petrified sandbank) that runs parallel to the shoreline, enclosing its harbor. Here is found the city's 1 Marco Zero. Eventually it became a port for the capital Olinda, which is just across the Beberibe. In 1630 came the Dutch invaders, establishing the colony of New Holland. They laid siege to Olinda, pillaging it in 1631, and built a new city on the island of Ant\u00f4nio Vaz opposite the first settlement, naming it Mauritsstadt, after count Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, governor from 1637 to 1644. His Vrijburg palace was built at the spot where Republic Square is today. Mauritsstadt's map shows two large forts, built of earth and wood, on either side of the walled city; the four-pointed northern one, Fort Ernest, was demolished to make way for the present Princesses' Field Palace. The five-pointed southern one, Fort Frederik Hendrik, has survived, rebuilt in stone, officially renamed Five-Pointed Fort, and has long been home to the Recife City Museum.\nNassau was a tolerant man, and allowed freedom of religion, but the Dutch West India Company bosses were hardline Calvinists, severe in architecture and taxation. This frustrated Nassau, who went home and left the company to impose its own rule, which drove the natives to rebellion. After the Dutch West India Company's larger, better equipped army's defeat (albeit a narrow one) to a Portuguese and Native force in the 1649 Guararapes battle at Recife's outskirts, opinion in Amsterdam considered that \"Dutch Brazil by now no longer has a future worth fighting for\". The last invaders were expelled in 1654, and a sizable resident Sephardic Jew community moved to New Amsterdam.\nRecife became the capital of Pernambuco in 1827.\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate is tropical, with two main seasons: dry (September\u2013March) and rainy (April\u2013August). Average annual temperature is 26\u00b0C (78.8\u00b0F), with limited variation.\n\n\nTourist information centers\nRecife Tourism information portal\n Recife Antigo, Rua da Guia, \u260f +55 81 3232-2942.

These guys can get a bit insistent.  Simply smile and one word will have them on their way: n\u00e3o (pronounced \"now\").

The national dish Feijoada (a stew of beans, pork and beef, served with rice and Farofa) is not very popular in Recife.\nOn the other hand some ingredients which are widely used in Recife are hardly found in the South of Brazil, as manioc flour (which is the main ingredient of tapioca), cuscuz (corn flour), pumpkin, jerked beef, goat or lamb. Seafood is exotic and delicious. The regional food has some peculiarities like Carne de Sol and buchada, a dish prepared with the stomach of billy goat.\n\nRecife is the birthplace of two traditional and delicious cakes Bolo de Rolo and Bolo Sousa Le\u00e3o.\nDo try the snacks on offer from beach vendors---little chicken and beef kebabs, oysters, prawns, and grilled cheese. Just be aware that some of the vendors may have been carrying them around for hours--if it doesn't look fresh, it probably isn't.\nA must try is Caldinho: a soup served all over the place (restaurants, dedicated carts and people with flasks selling it on the beach). Comes in a variety of flavors from black bean to shrimp. The person selling it will say \"completa\" when you order it. This simply means \"complete\", and if you say yes at this point you get a few added extras, such as a small boiled egg put into the cup of hot soup.\n\n\nRestaurants\nRecife is the gastronomic capital of the Northeast. There are more high-quality restaurants here than in any other city in Brazil north of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Chica Pitanga, Rua Petrolina, 19 - Boa Viagem, \u260f +55 91 3465-2224.

All they ask in return is that you buy your food and drink from them.\nThey all carry a menu and the food arrives quickly and freshly made on the beach. Try the seafood. The fish is usually caught locally and earlier that same day.\nApart from your own vendor, there will be a variety of vendors walking up and down the beach, selling a variety of things. Learning the language for these items is useful but unnecessary as the vendor will take the time to show you what he/she has on offer.\n\nPrawns (camar\u00e3o) - Be careful of the prawns-- smell them before purchase. A free sample is available with the word provar.  They might have been walked up and down the beach for hours in the hot sun. A quick sniff is enough to tell you if they are fresh or not. If you decide to eat them, here is a quick tip: hold the tail of the prawn, tear off and discard the head and leg sections, hold the very tip of the tail, pop the rest in your mouth and bite off the tip leaving it in your fingers. Yes, you can eat the shell; peel it if you wish, but you will not see the locals doing this.\nOysters (Ostra) - Vendors will be carrying a bucket full of ice and live oysters. They are prepared for you one at a time. Served with a squeeze of lime, salt and cumin powder.\nCrab - They do not come prepared, so unless you know which bits to eat and which bits to discard, steer clear!\nGrilled cheese (Queijo de Coalho) - No warnings here--just go ahead and enjoy.  It's a real treat.\nKebabs (Espetinhos) - Grilled chicken or beef. Cooked fresh right in front of you.\nIce-cream - The prices are a lot more expensive than just off the beach. But you don't have to get out of your chair.  In that heat, you will appreciate that.\nCaldinho - you will notice guys walking up and down the beach with flasks. These are full of different flavors of a soup called caldinho. Try prawn one with hot pepper sauce.\nOvos de codorna - Small boiled quail eggs ready to peel, salt and eat.\nNuts - A variety of nuts is available, cashew being the most obvious, because it's grown right there in northeastern Brazil.  Also, peanuts in 2 varieties: roasted or boiled.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nBars\nThere are many many bars in Recife, most, if not all, serving food as well as drinks. The prices are cheap.\nAt the less classy end of the market, there are some great bars. They don't have great signage to tell you that it's a bar. Basically, if you see some plastic garden furniture in the street, you are looking at a bar. These are usually the most fun places with the loudest people and the best vibe. Be careful of the ice in places like this as it might not be made from bottled water. It also helps to have a good constitution of you are going to eat in these bars.\n\nThere are huts selling food, beer, and the like about every half kilometer in the center of Boa Viagem beach.\nWarning: It might not be safe to walk to and from all these nightspots.
