Festa Junina was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John's day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. The festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice but during the tropical winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after 12 June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil it is largely an urban festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clich\u00e9s in a spirit of jokes and good times. These festivities involve wearing peasant costumes, dancing, heavy drinking, fireworks displays, and folk dancing. \n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
