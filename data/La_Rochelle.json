  "extract": "La Rochelle is a city in Charente-Maritime on the Atlantic coast of France. It has a charming old town and harbour, and is often called \"la ville blanche\" (the white city) for its limestone buildings: they're handsome in any weather, but brilliant when the sun shines down from a big blue Atlantic sky. In 2020 La Rochelle had a population of 77,210. \n\u00cele de R\u00e9 is a resort island 30 km long, linked to La Rochelle by a toll bridge, and also described on this page. Other islands in the bay, reached by boat trips, are \u00cele d'Aix, \u00cele d'Oleron (usually accessed via Rochefort), and the one you've seen on TV, Fort Boyard.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe Romans built villas, harvested salt from the lagoons, and introduced wine production, but La Rochelle - \"the little rock\" - only becomes identifiable from the 10th century. It was boosted as a port, like Bordeaux to the south, by the dynastic marriage in 1152 of Eleanor of Aquitane with the future Henry II of England. So it didn't just trade with England, it was an English possession, until the French state expanded in the 14th century. From the 17th century La Rochelle was the base for Atlantic shipping, with fishing off the banks of Newfoundland, Francophone colonies in the Americas, and troop movements as wars between England and France were fought abroad. It became France's leading port but modern shipping outgrew the little harbour, small enough to pull a chain across against marauders. Deep-water facilities moved west to La Pallice, while other development was at Les Minimes, a tract of reclaimed land just south. The historic port and town centre were therefore preserved, and today are the highlight of La Rochelle.\nThe 1 tourist office is at 2 Quai Georges Simenon 500 m northwest of the railway station, open W-F 10:00-13:00, 14:00-18:00, Sa-Tu 09:30-18:30.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 La Rochelle \u2013 \u00cele de R\u00e9 Airport (LRH  IATA), Rue du Jura (5 km west of city, east end of bridge to \u00cele de R\u00e9), \u260f +33 892 230103. This has year-round flights from Paris Orly, Lyon and London Stansted. Summer flights include Ajaccio, Bristol, Charleroi, Dublin, Geneva, Leeds, London (Gatwick and Stansted), Manchester, Marseille, Nice and Porto.   (updated Jun 2023)\nBus 7 runs downtown (Place de Verdun) M-Sa every 30 min, taking 15 min, fare \u20ac1.30. In July and August a bus runs from the airport directly to \u00cele de R\u00e9, at other times you'll have to backtrack via downtown. Taxis wait outside the terminal building, with the fare to town about \u20ac20.\n\n\nBy train\nTGVs run from Paris Montparnasse every couple of hours, taking 3 hours via Poitiers and Niort. Five or six trains a day run from Bordeaux (2 hr 30 min via Saintes and Rochefort), and from Nantes (3 hr).\n2 La Rochelle Ville the railway station is 500 m south of old town centre, near the aquarium and Maritime Museum. It has a grand facade but is poky inside. Cars can be rented from agencies opposite the station.\n\n\nBy bus\nFlixbus runs once a day from Paris Bercy Seine, 7 hr. They also run from Nantes (2 hr) and Toulouse (6 hr). Daily buses run from Bilbao and Madrid, and one comes all the way from Algeciras (for ferries from Morocco), taking 24 hours via Malaga, Granada, Jaen, Madrid, Burgos, Vitoria-Gasteiz, San Sebastian, Irun, Bayonne and Bordeaux. \nThe bus to \u00cele de R\u00e9 is run in conjunction with SNCF, so it's through-ticketed, displayed on rail departure boards, and timed to connect with the Paris trains.\nJean Moulin bus station is south flank of the railway station on Rue des Jars, reached by footbridge. It's just an open-air parking lot with flimsy bus shelters, no facilities or departure displays or anything.\nSome long-distance and most local services stop at Place de Verdun, by the cathedral in the old town.\n\n\nBy road\nFrom Paris take the A10 onto N11 for La Rochelle. From Bordeaux take A10 then exit onto A837 then D137.\n\u00cele de R\u00e9 toll bridge in 2023 charges \u20ac16 return per car in high season (mid-June to mid-Sept) and \u20ac8 the rest of the year. The bridge is free for pedestrians, cyclists and motorbikes under 50 cc.\n\n\nBy boat\nCruise liners occasionally call at La Rochelle, docking at the far end of Viaduc Pr\u00e9sident Christian Morch, 10 km west of town near the bridge to \u00cele de R\u00e9. Typically these are on week-long cruises of the Bay of Biscay and Channel Islands, with passengers coming ashore for a day-trip to the Dordogne and quick look at the old town. They're not available to book as point-to-point ferries.\n\n\nGet around\n\nWalking is your best choice around the old town and harbour.\nY\u00e9lo is the public transport combine - it's a pun on \"yellow\" and \"v\u00e9lo\". A single bus ticket can be bought by bank card on the bus: in 2024 it costs \u20ac1.50 and is valid for one transfer within one hour. A 10-unit ticket costs \u20ac12, a 24-hour pass is \u20ac5, a 7-day pass is \u20ac22. Buy these from Y\u00e9lo kiosks, for instance in Place de Verdun, which just about every bus line passes through. One exception is the Friday evening summer service to \u00cele de R\u00e9, which goes direct from the railway station.\nThe ferry from Vieux Port to Port des Minimes runs hourly, fare \u20ac3. \nThe bike rental service is also run by Y\u00e9lo: you first need to register at their kiosk in Place de Verdun, with ID and credit card for a \u20ac150 deposit. Short-term rental is \u20ac1 for the first 30 min then \u20ac1.50 per 30 min - these rentals may not be taken to \u00cele de R\u00e9. Longer hires are also easily arranged. There are 112 pick-up and return stations across the city.\n\n\nSee\n\nVieux Port is the oldest and most picturesque part of La Rochelle, dominated by its defensive towers. The quayside extends 200 m upstream from the port, along Canal Maubec. Most buildings are centuries old and very well maintained. The narrow streets and pale stone buildings make the city feel more Midi than Atlantic.\n1 Tour de la Grosse Horloge is the Gothic great gate and clocktower connecting the quays to the network of old streets behind, which enclose the market hall, the Protestant church, and the New World Museum. Eventually Vieux Port opens onto Place de Verdun, with the Cathedral of St-Louis.\n2 Tour de la Cha\u00eene: If a party of enormous chess pieces came down to the seaside and got drunk, they would resemble these three 14th- / 15th-century towers. Tour de la Cha\u00eene and Tour St Nicholas lean over the narrow harbour entrance: a stout chain was raised between them to keep out trouble (often English). A rampart stretches west to Tour de la Lanterne, the former lighthouse. You can visit the towers daily 10:00 to 13:00 and 14:15 to 17:30 (18:30 during daylight saving). Adult entry costs \u20ac9.50 per tower, or \u20ac13 for all three, child free.\n\u00c9glise Protestante is at 2 Rue Saint-Michel, a block back from the quay. It has a small exhibition on the local Huguenot community and holds services on Sunday at 10:30.\nH\u00f4tel de Ville is the ornate 14th century town hall, still in use.

It also incorporates the 12th century bell tower of its predecessor.\n6 Mus\u00e9e Maritime, Place Bernard Moitessier, \u260f +33 5 4628 0300. Tu-F, Su 10:00-12:30, 13:30-17:30, Sa 13:30-17:30.

They usually do well and qualify for European tournaments. The stadium dates to the 1920s, but has been renovated several times and now has a capacity of 16,000. It's named for Marcel Deflandre, who was club president in 1940 when rugby league (\"rugby-a-treize\") was outlawed by the Vichy government, its assets handed over without compensation to rugby union clubs, and the union game greatly strengthened in France.   (updated Jun 2023)\nFootball - soccer - is only played at amateur level, by ES La Rochelle down in the minor leagues.\nPort des Minimes is one of the biggest pleasure boat marinas in Europe: mostly yachts not motorboats.\nBoat trips head out to Fort Boyard and \u00cele-d'Aix, with over a dozen operators.\nPlage des Minimes is the closest beach to town, a sandy expanse just south of the marina.
