  "extract": "Waterloo is a historic town in the Walloon province of Walloon Brabant in Belgium (close to Brussels). The town is known mainly for the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 where Napoleon Bonaparte went down to his final defeat, leading to his second exile on Saint Helena. However, it has also become one of Belgium's most economically affluent and dynamic towns, thanks to its proximity to Brussels and the presence of international firms.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy bus\nThe most convenient way to get to Waterloo from Brussels is the hourly bus to Charleroi operated by TEC. It starts at Bruxelles-Midi/Zuid station and, after about half an hour, has a stop that is just 300 meters away from the Lion's Mound.\n\n\nBy train\nThe 1 Braine-l'Alleud Train Station is the closest one to get to the Lion's Mound and NOT the 2 Waterloo Train Station, which is located much more north. Hourly trains run from Brussels and (on weekdays) Antwerp to Nivelles, stopping at Waterloo and Braine-l'Alleud. From the Waterloo station it is a 5-kilometer walk to the site, from the Braine-l'Alleud station 2.5 kilometers.\n\n\nBy car\nThe site of the Waterloo battlefield can be easily reached by car from the R0 motorway. You need to get off at exit 25. From there the site is very near. Next to the Lion's Mound site is a free parking lot.\n\n\nGet around\n\nCity buses are infrequent especially on weekends/holidays. The town center is small and easily walkable.\n\n\nSee\n1 Waterloo Battlefield, Lion's Mound, Route du Lion, 1815 B-1420 (R0 exit 25 and/or Chauss\u00e9e de Nivelles), \u260f +32 2 385 19 12, info@waterloo1815.be.
