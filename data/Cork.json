  "extract": "Cork is the principal city of County Cork in southwest Ireland. Known as \"the Rebel City\" the \"real capital of Ireland\", Cork has a strong independence and Corkonians are proud of its role in Irish history. This historic merchant port has a lot of Georgian architecture and lively arts, music and food scenes.  \nIt was already the second-largest city in Ireland when in 2019 its boundaries were extended, to have a population of 210,000. The new boundary includes the town of Blarney, but this is described on its own page; Cobh and Crosshaven downriver remained separate.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nCorcaigh is an old word for \"salt-marsh\" \u2014 the River Lee broke up into a wetland delta draining into the drowned valley that forms its natural outer harbour. It was tidal and navigable, and Saint Fin Barre founded a monastery on its south bank in 606 AD, the nucleus of a settlement. The Vikings in the 9th and 10th centuries and the Anglo-Normans from the 12th were also attracted by this fertile area, and sought to claim the area as their own. It was under King Henry II that Cork was granted city status in 1185.\nMedieval Cork was walled for defence and overcrowded, so several river channels became infilled, the basis of what is now St Patrick's Street, South Mall and Grand Parade. The main north and south channels persisted, enclosing the arrow-shaped island of the city centre. Cork's heyday was the 17th century, when sea trade was booming but ships had not yet outgrown the river; later the port moved downstream to Cobh. Prosperous suburbs such as Sunday's Well and Montenotte were built on higher ground on the north bank, while on the south bank a university campus grew up from the 19th century.\nThe Cork Tourist Information Centre is at 125 St Patrick's St, corner of Lavitt's Quay one block west of the bus station.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Cork Airport (ORK  IATA), Kinsale Rd (8 km south of centre on N27), \u260f +353 21 431 3131. The main operators are Aer Lingus and Ryanair. Flights are short-haul from the UK and Europe: the runway is too small for wide-bodied jets so there's nothing transatlantic or from the Gulf. UK destinations are London (Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted), Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle upon Tyne. Year-round European destinations are Amsterdam, Budapest, Gdansk, Katowice, Krakow, Lanzarote, Lisbon, Malaga, Malta, Munich, Paris CDG, Pozna\u0144, Tenerife and Wroc\u0142aw. There are seasonal flights from other Med destinations and the ski resorts. The airport has a single terminal, with a long hall for departures and arrivals, and a similar long airside hall for departures. There are the usual facilities including car hire. The airport hotel is a short walk away and Travelodge is 2 km north, see Sleep.   (updated Mar 2023)\nTo the city: Buses 225 / 226 run every 30 min between the airport, Parnell Place next to Cork bus station, and the main railway station, taking 25 min to the city. Bus 225 starts from Haulbowline navy base via Ringaskiddy cruiser terminal and Carrigaline, Bus 226 starts from Kinsale. In 2023 an adult single is \u20ac2.20 by cash and \u20ac2 by Leap card. \nThe taxi rank is outside Arrivals. A taxi to city centre might be \u20ac25 for up to four passengers.\nDublin Airport (DUB IATA) may work out better, for its better range of flights and direct buses to Cork.\nShannon Airport (SNN IATA) near Limerick is a good alternative for transatlantic flights. There's public transport to Cork but you'll be wanting a rental car.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nIn summer there are car ferries from Roscoff (15 hr) and Santander (26 hr) to Cork once or twice a week, operated by Brittany Ferries. They were suspended in 2020 and the timetable for 2021 has not been announced.\n2 Cork Ferry Terminal is at Ringaskiddy, 15 km south east of the city on N28. Bus 223 / 225 runs here, see Get around.\nCruise liners often visit: they may dock at Cobh or at Ringaskiddy, or land passengers by tender for excursions. Many are on round-trip itineraries, but check the upcoming cruise schedule in case a point-to-point journey is possible. For instance transatlantic one-way cruises from New York might let you off at Cork on their way to Southampton.\n\n\nBy train\n\nTrains run hourly from Dublin Heuston, taking 2 hr 40 min to Cork via Kildare, Portlaoise, Ballybrophy, Thurles, Limerick Junction (for Tipperary) and Mallow. A walk-up single is around \u20ac40, see Irish Rail website for timetables, fares and online tickets. From central Dublin, get a ticket from city centre not Heuston, as this includes the tram fare and saves a couple of euros over separate tickets.\nFrom Limerick, change at Limerick Junction. Change there also coming from Waterford, via Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cahir and Tipperary.\nFrom Tralee (via Killarney and Mallow) a couple of trains are direct, but you normally change at Mallow onto the commuter train.\nCommuter trains run from Cobh and from Midleton every 30 min. See Get Around for the suburban stations.\n3 Kent Station is the main station,on Lower Glanmire Road, 500 m east of city centre. There's just a coffee shop here but lots of facilities outside on the street, and be grateful that your train isn't going to be hauled by Engine No 36, the Victorian 2-2-2 loco in the main hall. For local buses take the south exit onto Horgan's Quay. The station is named for Thomas Kent or Tom\u00e1s Ceannt (1865 \u2013 1916), executed for his part in the Easter Rising. He and his three brothers actually stayed home, but when the police came to arrest known sympathisers there was a shoot-out which killed his brother Richard and a policeman.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses run hourly from Dublin Airport (3 hr 30 min) and Bus\u00e1ras (3 hr) to Cork, for a single adult fare of around \u20ac20. There's competition on the route between Aircoach (Bus 704X), Bus \u00c9ireann (Expressway X8) and Gobus.\nCity Link runs every 3 hours from Galway via Shannon Airport, Limerick, and Cork city centre and airport. The slower Bus \u00c9ireann 51 runs hourly from Galway via Ennis, Shannon Airport, Limerick and Mallow to Cork.\nExpressway Bus 40 runs hourly from Rosslare harbour (for ferries from Wales and the Continent) via Wexford, New Ross, Waterford, Dungarvan and Youghal to Cork, where it takes a break then continues west to Macroom, Ballyvourney, Killarney, Farranfore (for Kerry Airport) and Tralee.\nBus \u00c9ireann 260 runs five times a day from Youghal to Cork; some of them start from  Ardmore in County Waterford.\nThe bus terminus is 4 Parnell Place  off Merchants Quay.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Dublin take M7 onto M8 and reckon 2 hr 30 min. There are tolls at Portlaoise and Fermoy, \u20ac1.90 at each, pay online or by phone. Avoid rush hour in Dublin or Cork if you can.\nN20 from Limerick is mostly an undivided road and will take around 1 hr 45 min to Cork. Say an hour from Killarney and 90 min from Waterford.\nFrom Cobh you could cross via 5 Passage West Ferry onto R610.\nTry to avoid bringing a car into city centre. If you're day-tripping, use the Park & Ride at Black Ash south side of the city; it's well signposted and cost \u20ac5 to park all day, with a free bus to and from the centre. The last outbound bus is at 8PM and the park is locked at 8:30PM so it's not for evening attractions. The University has its own Park & Ride and shuttle bus, but you need to show staff or student ID to use it.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nCork has a small city centre, and most places to stay, eat, drink and tour are within one busy km. So too are the transport hubs.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nThere are many cycleways, both in-street and segregated, with some contraflow lanes.\nThe bike share scheme has docking stations across the city centre extending west to UCC. You need to register and pay a deposit of \u20ac150. As of Nov 2020, an annual pass is \u20ac10 and a 3-day visitor pass is \u20ac3. The first 30 min of any journey is free.\nCycle shops offering bike hire are Cycle Scene and The Bike Shed. Kilgrews in city centre sell and repair but don't hire.\n\n\nBy train\nIrish Rail commuter trains serve three lines out of Cork Kent station:\n\nEast then south every 30-60 min to Little Island, Glounthaune, Fota (for Wildlife Park), Carrigaloe, Rushbrooke and Cobh, taking 25 min, single fare \u20ac5.\nEast every 30-60 min to Little Island, Glounthaune, Carrigtwohill and Midleton, for the Jameson Whiskey Distillery, 25 min, single fare \u20ac5.\nNorth hourly non-stop to Mallow, for the racecourse, 25 min. Many of these are inter-city trains to Dublin Heuston or Tralee, but you pay the same commuter fare of around \u20ac10 single.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nBuses in Cork are run by Bus \u00c9ireann, with 22 routes, see map. Apart from three orbital routes that you're unlikely to use (201 north, 219 south and 225 further south), they all run cross-town, with central stops around St Patrick Street, Merchants Quay or Parnell Place main bus station. They run daily 6:30AM-11:30PM, every 10-20 min at peak times, except Bus 220 which runs 24 hours.\n\nRoute 202 from Hollyhill and Knocknaheeney northwest to city centre then Blackrock and Mahon Point southeast.\nRoute 203 from Farranree and Blackpool in the north to city centre then Turners Cross and Ballyphehane south.\nRoute 205 from Cork Institute of Technology and University College Cork west to Kent Railway Station.\nRoute 208 from Curraheen and Cork University Hospital southwest to city centre then Mayfield and Lotabeg northeast.\nRoute 213 from Black Ash Park & Ride south to St Patrick Street in the city centre; no Sunday service. The P&R is locked at 8:30PM.\nRoute 214 from Cork University Hospital and Wilton southwest to city centre.\nRoutes 215 and 215A from Jacobs Island and Mahon Point southeast to South Mall in the city centre. Route 215 also extends northwest across the city to Blarney and Cloghroe.\nRoute 220 runs 24 hours from Ovens and Ballincollig in the west to city centre then Douglas and Carrigaline southeast. Alternate buses continue to Crosshaven.\nMost bus stops have real time displays. You can also plan your journey and check real time arrivals with the TFI website and apps. All buses are low-floor wheelchair accessible.\nCash fares within the city are \u20ac2.40-2.80 adult and \u20ac1.40-1.70 child, while if paying with a TFI Leap Card are \u20ac1.68-1.96 adult and \u20ac0.98-1.19 child. On TFI Leap Card, 24-hour, 7-day and monthly tickets are also available.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis bear a yellow bar with their licence number and \"taxi\" or \"Tacsa\u00ed\" printed on it. If the light is on, the taxi is available for hire. Have nothing to with unofficial taxis.  \nFares are nationally regulated so you pay the same stuck in traffic trying to reach the airport as you do up a back lane in Ballydehob. Taxis are required to use the meter, to accept credit and debit cards as well as cash, and not to surcharge any card. However it's \u20ac3 extra for booking instead of hailing on the street or using a taxi rank, and phone apps may impose a further charge. Fares are revised every two years so from Dec 2024 you pay:\n\nStandard rate (M-Sa 8AM-8PM): Flagfall (then 500 m or 85 sec) \u20ac4.40; then Tariff A (next 15 km or 43 min) \u20ac1.32 / km or \u20ac0.47 / minutes to max \u20ac23.60; then Tariff B \u20ac1.72 / km or \u20ac0.61 / min.\nPremium rate (M-Sa 8PM-8AM, all day Sunday and most public holidays): Flagfall \u20ac5.40, Tariff A \u20ac1.81 / km or \u20ac0.64 / minutes to max \u20ac31.80; then Tariff B \u20ac2.20 / km or \u20ac0.78 / min.\nSpecial rate (Sa Su midnight-4AM, 24 Dec 8PM through Christmas to 8AM 26 Dec, 31 Dec 8PM to 8AM 1 Jan): same as Premium rate but after flagfall you go straight to Tariff B, there's no Tariff A.\nYou may be able to negotiate a rate for a tour round the sights, eg out to Blarney Castle.\n\n\nSee\n1 Crawford Art Gallery, Emmett Place T12 TNE6, \u260f +353 21 480 5042. M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-4PM. The permanent collection includes paintings by Jack Yeats and Sean Keating, and a series of plaster casts of classical statues, which King George IV found tedious. The gallery is expected to close for two years from Sep 2024 for rebuilding. Free.   (updated Mar 2023)\n2 Elizabeth Fort, Barrack St T12 C8A0, \u260f +353 21 497 5947. Tu-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su noon-5PM. The original fort built in 1601 was just timber and earth, and the citizens made short work of it. It was rebuilt from 1624 as a stout \"star\" fortress. It lost its defensive role in 1719 but was variously used as a barracks, a depot for convicts (mostly female) awaiting transportation to the colonies, and a police station to 2013. It's now simply a tourist area with a gallery and occasional events, and you can walk along the walls. Free.   (updated Mar 2023)\n\n3 St Fin Barre's Cathedral, Bishop St T12 K710, \u260f +353 21 496 3387. M-Sa 9:30AM-5:30PM, Su 1-5:30PM. Saint Fin Barre (550-623 AD) was a preacher who spent his last 17 years hereabouts. A monastery dedicated to him was built in the 7th century, and there have been at least three churches on the site before the present building. This is an elaborate Church of Ireland (Anglican) cathedral built 1865-79 in Gothic Revival style. The interior is relatively small: Burgess the architect realised it would go way over budget so the focus was on creating a grand frontage, to impress the citizens and overawe the resurgent Catholics. There are three great spires, intricate carvings and gargoyles, stain glass windows, and a high ceiling over a rather stubby nave. The pipe organ adds to the cathedral's many expensive items of construction and maintenance. Adult \u20ac7, conc \u20ac6, child free.   (updated Mar 2023)\n4 Nano Nagle Place, Douglas St T12 X70A, \u260f +353 21 419 3580. Tu-Su 10AM-5PM. Honora Nagle (1718-1784) pioneered Catholic education for girls in an era when that was repressed by the Penal Laws. She founded an Ursuline convent and the Presentation Sisters, which inspired Edmund Rice in Waterford to found the Presentation Brothers and later Christian Brothers. The museum depicts Nano's life, times and works, and the garden is an oasis of tranquillity. Adult \u20ac7.50, conc \u20ac5, child \u20ac4.50.  (updated Mar 2023)\nRed Abbey Tower is off Douglas St just east of Nano Nagle Place. It's one of the few medieval structures remaining in Cork, the bell tower of a 14th-century Augustinian abbey: in 1690 John Churchill (later Duke of Marlborough) used its vantage point to blast away at the Jacobites below. The Augustinians moved out in the 18th century and the abbey became a sugar refinery, then in 1799 a fire destroyed everything except the tower. You can't go inside.\n5 Church of St Anne, Shandon (Shandon Bells), Church St T23 YN88, \u260f +353 21 450 5906. Mar-May Oct: M-Sa 10AM-4PM, Su 11:30AM-4PM; Jun-Sep: M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11:30AM-4:30PM; Nov-Feb: daily 11AM-3PM. Shandon is the neighbourhood climbing the hill along the old road to Mallow. This Church of Ireland (Anglican) church was built in 1722; the famously inaccurate clock on its tower became known as \"the four-faced liar\". The church is best known for the eight \"bells of Shandon that sound so grand on / the pleasant waters of the River Lee\" as the 19th century ballad has it. (Who but Francis Mahony aka \"Father Prout\" would have dared rhyme Moscow with kiosk-o?) St Anne's bells are hung \"dead\" and rung by an Ellacombe apparatus. The most sonorous peel of bells is from change-ringing, which rotates them through 360\u00b0, but this demands skill and is sometimes impractical to build. It also incites scandalous behaviour, according to the Rev Henry Thomas Ellacombe of Gloucestershire, who in 1821 devised a mechanism whereby hammers struck stationary bells as resolutely as they would strike down temptation to sin. St Anne's is one of the two dozen churches in Britain and Ireland that still have functioning apparatus, and visitors can ding the bells from the tower first floor. There are 132 steps to the tower balcony, with a narrow squeeze as you clamber through the belfry, hoping that the group below doesn't choose that moment to start chiming. Church free, tower adult \u20ac5, child \u20ac2, conc \u20ac4.

Adult \u20ac5, students & seniors \u20ac4, child \u20ac2. (updated Mar 2023)\n6 Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne, Roman St T23 NX76, \u260f +353 21 430 4325. M-Th 8:30AM-4:30PM, F 8:30AM-3:30PM. This is the neo-Gothic Roman Catholic cathedral, opened in 1808.  (updated Mar 2023)\n7 Holy Trinity Church, Father Mathew Quay T12 EF63, \u260f +353 21 427 0827. This Roman Catholic church is a stonking great neo-Gothic affair built in fits and starts 1830-1890. (No jokes about workmen's leisurely lunch breaks please, the famine years were the problem.) There's an active Capuchin Friary attached. The church is dedicated to Father Theobald Mathew (1790-1856) who founded the temperance movement in Ireland, but fell into bad odour on a trip to the USA for his weasel equivocations on abolition of slavery.   (updated Mar 2023)\n8 Cork City Gaol, Convent Avenue, Sunday\u2019s Well T23 VX25 (1 km west of centre), \u260f +353 21 430 5022, info@corkcitygaol.com. Mar-Oct: daily 10AM-5PM; Nov-Feb: F-M 10AM-4PM. Fascinating jail museum. It was opened in 1924 to hold male and female prisoners of the city, while those whose crime was committed outside the city were held at the county jail across the river, now the UCC campus. In 1878 the prisons were segregated: City Gaol became the women's prison and all the men were marched away to the county jail, while all county women were marched here. In 1919 Countess Markiewicz was held here for making a seditious speech; after Irish independence it held anti-treaty Republicans. In 1923 there was a mass escape, thereafter the gaol closed. In 1927 it became a radio station and part of the museum displays this. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac8.50, child \u20ac6.  (updated Mar 2023)\n9 Cork Public Museum, Fitzgerald's Park, Mardyke T12 V0AA, \u260f +353 21 427 0679. Tu-F 10AM-4PM, Sa 11AM-4PM. Wide-ranging museum depicts the city's history from prehistoric to modern times. There's a good section on Michael Collins and the anti-Treaty Cork Brigades of the Irish civil war. Free. (updated Mar 2023)\nFitzgerald's Park outside the museum is a genteel municipal space on the riverside, laid out in 1902 after Cork hosted an international trade exhibition here. Your only excitement will be from crossing the pedestrian \"Shaky Bridge\" to Sunday's Well Rd on the north bank.\n\n10 The Glucksman, University College T12 V1WH, \u260f +353 21 490 1844. M-Sa 11AM-5PM, Su 2-5PM. Gallery in stylish modern building opened 2006 within the university, with rotating art exhibitions. Its sponsor Lewis Glucksman (1925-2006) had been CEO of Lehman Brothers, remember them? He lived in Cobh from 1999 and was a major benefactor of cultural initiatives. Donation \u20ac5.   (updated Mar 2023)\n11 University College Cork (UCC) main campus is beyond the Glucksman on Western Rd. You can stroll around (see college map) and take in the variety of architecture, from the modern extension of the Boole Library to the Honan Chapel, completed in 1917 but got up in Celtic-Gothic style to look much older.\n12 Lough park is 1 km south of city centre. The Lough, which gives its name to the neighbourhood, is a small freshwater lake fed by springs bubbling out of the limestone; it's barely 1 metre deep. The Lough is ringed by housing but is a wildlife reserve: waterfowl nest on the wooded island at the south end. The lough shore has a firm track of 1.1 km, popular with joggers and dog-walkers. There are carp, eels, tench and other freshwater fish, and coarse angling is permitted by catch and release. There's a cafe by the north end and a bar with meals at the south end.\n\n\nFurther out\n13 Blackrock Castle Observatory, Castle Rd, Blackrock T12 YW52 (Bus 202 towards Mahon), \u260f +353 21 432 6120, info@bco.ie. W-Su 10AM-4PM. If pirates ever try to attack Cork from the moon, this place will give ample warning. It was first built in 1582 to defend the harbour and its shipping, but twice burnt down without the help of any marauders. The present castle is a cod-medieval structure of 1828; in 2007 it became an astronomy museum and observatory. Adult \u20ac7, conc or child \u20ac5.

Impressive tower house from 14th century, but mostly 15th and 16th; it fell derelict but was restored in the 1990s. The interior is again closed for restoration but you can see the attractive herb and knot gardens, and an orchard with examples of every type of Irish Apple Tree. Garden free.   (updated Mar 2023)\n16 Midleton is a town 16 km west of Cork along the road to Youghal. Its main attraction is the Old Midleton Distillery or \"Jameson Experience\", with a huge waterwheel and pot still, which produced Jameson whiskey from 1825. It's open for tours daily 10:30AM-5PM (\u20ac26 in 2023). In 1975 production transferred to the new distillery alongside; the business is now owned by Pernod Ricard. There are tour buses from Cork to the distillery, and the railway re-opened in 2009, so Midleton has grown into a large commuter town. The Farmer's Market is held on Saturday 9AM-1AM.\n17 Ballincollig is a small village 5 km west of Cork which throughout the 19th century held a large military-industrial complex, the Royal Gunpowder Mills.
