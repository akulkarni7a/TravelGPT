  "extract": "Goi\u00e2nia, the capital of Goi\u00e1s, is a large city in central Brazil.\n\n\nUnderstand\nOne of several major planned cities, Goi\u00e2nia was founded in 1933. The city plan is generally radial, with Avenida Goi\u00e1s running north-south and intersecting Avenida Anhanguera at the center. It was planned for about 50,000 inhabitants, but as of 2016, it has over 1\u00bd million in the city and 2\u00bd million in the metropolitan area. The architectural plan was designed by At\u00edlio Correia Lima, who took the art-deco style to the first buildings of the city. It was founded by Pedro Ludovico Teixeira because the old capital, City of Goi\u00e1s, did not meet the administrative needs of the state capital.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nGood air service. Non-Stop flights from S\u00e3o Paulo - 1 hour 20 minutes flight time. From Goi\u00e2nia, there are numerous flights per day to other cities in Brazil, either through S\u00e3o Paulo or Brasilia. At the airport of Goi\u00e2nia you can do business and exchange offers many rental vehicles and taxi points.\n\n\nBy bus\nGoi\u00e2nia has a very good bus station at Pra\u00e7a do Trabalhador, (worker's square), which connects it to any other place in Brazil. So, taking a bus to or from Goi\u00e2nia will not be a big problem. If you visit Brasilia, which is 3 hours away by bus (R$35 - conventional bus), it's even easier to visit. The bus station is on the northern side, about 1 km from the central district. The bus terminal shares its location with Araguaia Shopping.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy taxi\nFor international visitors, taxis are you best option.  Fares run around R$20 or less for most rides within the central area of the city\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nGoiania is covered by some e-hailing services including Uber.\n\n\nSee\n\nDuring the day, there really isn't much to be seen in Goi\u00e2nia, as it's the urban center of a young region. There are a couple of parks you can visit, malls and commercial streets. At night, you can find many bars, pubs and night clubs filled with young people. Each of these is attended by very well defined social classes.\n\n1 Pra\u00e7a Pedro Ludovico (Civic Square), city center.
