  "extract": "La Camargue encompasses the Rhone River delta in the southeast of France. It is one of the best places in Europe for birdwatching; also great for biking and horse riding.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nLandscape\nThe Carmargue is western Europe's largest river delta, with an area of 930 sq km. A vast plain of large brine lagoons (known locally as \u00e9tangs), cut off from the sea by sandbars and surrounded by reed-covered marshes.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe Carmargue has over 400 species of birds. The brine ponds are a habitat of the greater flamango.\nCamargue horses (Camarguais) roam these marshlands, together with Camargue cattle.\n\n\nClimate\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nFees and permits\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n1 Parc ornithologique du Pont de Gau, 13460 Stes Maries de la mer, \u260f +33 4 90 97 82 62, contact@parcornithologique.com. 9AM-6PM. The short trail has the greatest number of seabirds. Lots of herons, flamingos, egrets, stilts, gulls, avocets, ibis and other birds. You can see them fairly close and in their nests. Coypu can be spotted in the grass and trails as well. Once inside, you can stay although the entrance closes. The evening was when the flamingos could be seen flying in formation. There is a small snack bar and you can bring your own picnic. The longer trail was also an easy walk. Of course, the time of year will alter the birds that are present. There are good signs along the trail with information about recent sightings.  (updated Sep 2023)\n\n\nDo\n\nDrive around the marshes and stop at viewing platforms or side of the road to look for flamingos and other large seabirds. White horses and herds of bulls can also be seen, more likely by following the smaller side roads.\nBike along the Digue de Mer. There are also many beaches in the area but the roads are not paved and very rough (many potholes). Planning your route and taking enough water and food is vital as the distances can be substantial. \n\n\nEat\n\n\nLocal specialty foods\nSpecialty foods of the Camargue include:\n\nBouillabaisse\nAncho\u00efade\nAnguilles au four\nGardiane de Taureau\nSalade Camarguaise\nAubergines aux anchois et aux capres\nBarbouillade d'artichauts\nBrandade de Morue\nCanard aux figues\nMoules en Brasucado\nHachis camarguais\nFougasse d'Aigues Mortes\nLa Broufado\n\n\nFinding a good dinner\nWhen staying in a touristy city like Saintes Maries de la Mer, it can be difficult to find a place for a good dinner with anything beyond fried chips and over-grilled meat.\nHowever, if you have a car, here are some tips for finding a good place serving local cuisine. Internet connection can help in your research. You should look for:\n\nRestaurants out of town, even in remote locations. Minus the convenience factor of an in-town location, many countryside restaurants rely on local customers and fidelity to regional cuisine which attracts enough clientele despite remote location.\nMenu that lists mostly or exclusively local specialties (see the list above)\nFerme Auberge (farm inn), an official government program. Members usually show good fidelity to local cuisine, though limited menu selection.\nMembership in Conservatoire des Cuisines de Camargue, society for the preservation of true Camargue cuisine\nTable d'hote (guest table), a kind of intimate restaurant. Often a bed and breakfast which prepares dinner with advance reservation. Don't confuse it with table d'hotes in a regular restaurant in a big city where it is more for solo diners to share a communal table\u2014and more common at lunch.\nAsk at the local tourist information office. They are not allowed to give opinions, but you can ask what restaurants serve local dishes in the list above or if there are any table d'hote or ferme auberge in the region.\nHere are some restaurants that look promising per above recommendations as of Sept 2010:\n==== on the road to Saintes Maries de la Mer:\n1 Le Flamant Rose, 184 rue des peupliers blancs, Albaron (on the D 37), \u260f +33 4 90 97 10 18, fax: +33 4 90 97 12 47, lacave.frederic@wanadoo.fr. Member of a society for the preservation of true Camargue cuisine. Local specialties, plus a remote location. \n2 Le Pont des Bannes. Very elegant. Hits every major local specialty and has almost nothing from outside the region on the menu. Dinner menus: starter+main+dessert: \u20ac43; starter+main: \u20ac36; main+dessert: 31; starter+dessert: 17. \n\n La Tour du Cazeau, Arles The Sambuc, \u260f +33 4 90 97 21 6, fax: +33 4 90 97 20 70, contact@tour-du-cazeau.com.

The most rustic \u2013 most likely to prepare food you absolutely cannot get outside of the Camargue.
