  "extract": "Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG  IATA) is the main airport of Paris, one of the busiest hubs in Europe, largest airport in France and home of the national carrier Air France. It is north of Paris and is sometimes referred to as Roissy Airport. The airport is named after General Charles de Gaulle, wartime leader of the Free French and later President of France.\nIt is owned by the A\u00e9roports de Paris group together with Paris Orly Airport.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nCDG is amongst the largest airports in the world not only in terms of traffic, but also surface area, and its multiple disjointed terminals and sheer size may be disorienting. While connections to, from, and via CDG are often attractive, one needs to take extra care not to get lost, and plan in extra time to just cover the distances needed to get to or from the gate.\n\n\nTerminals\nCDG has three terminals. The free CDGVal shuttle train runs between terminals, car parks and train stations.\n\n1 Terminal 1. The original one, built in the 1970s to serve the intercontinental \"jumbo jets\" that had just debuted in service. It is notable for its unusual layout and retrofuturistic brutalist design, with a round central section featuring underground travelator connections to seven \"satellites\" named 1T through 1Z (not used at the airport but used on the guide to talk about the different satellites) to which planes dock via jetways. Nowadays it is used by Star Alliance carriers and some other non-allied airlines.  (updated Jun 2019)\n2 Terminal 2. The notoriously confusing gigantic one, consisting of interconnected sections named 2A through 2G. Terminal 2G is a separate building from other \"Terminals 2x\" and is only reachable via navette/bus in 10-15 min (bus leaves every 20 min) so allow extra time if you travel to/from there. Terminal 2 houses all Air France flights, as well as those of other SkyTeam carriers, with some other airlines' gates spread over the many sections. Notably, Easyjet uses terminal 2D.  (updated Mar 2019)\n3 Terminal 3. The low-cost terminal serving low-fare carriers, including Vueling, but not Easyjet, which has gates in 2D. The CDGVal station shared with Roissyp\u00f4le requires a walk from the CDGVal station to its entrance, and has limited facilities. (updated Mar 2019)\n\n\nGare A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV\nThis is the TGV train station in the middle of the airport's Terminal 2 (between sections 2C/D and 2E/F of the Terminal), where both national and international TGV trains stop. Both the RER B train and CDGVal stop here (both stations shared with Terminal 2).\n\n\nRoissyp\u00f4le\nThe area consisting of hotels and other services situated between the Northern side (Terminal 1 and 3) and Southern side (Terminal 2) of the airport. It has a CDGVal stop shared with Terminal 3, and also has the second of the 2 RER B stops, closer on the way to Paris.\n\n\nFlights\nCheck with your airline before leaving for the airport.\n\n\nTerminal 1\nMost Star Alliance flights.\n\n\nTerminal 2\nAir France, easyJet, most  Skyteam flights, and most OneWorld flights.\n\n\nTerminal 3\nMost low cost carrier flights.\n\n\nDestinations\nA list of destinations is available on Paris A\u00e9roport's website: https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/flights/destinations/destinations-directory\n\n\nGround transportation\n\n\nBy train to Paris\n\nThe RER train line \"B\" connects CDG airport to central Paris and is the fastest and most economical option for most travellers.  The airport has stations in T3 (where you can take the free CDGVAL shuttle train to T1) and T2. Trains to Paris leave every 8 minutes and all stop at Gare du Nord (TGVs to Lille, Eurostar trains to the UK and Thalys trains to Belgium and Holland), Ch\u00e2telet-Les Halles, Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Denfert-Rochereau and Cit\u00e9 Universitaire. Adult tickets cost \u20ac11.45, and for children between 4-9 the fare is \u20ac7 each. You can also purchase daily pass for all trains inside Paris for zones 1 to 5 for \u20ac28.50.\nTickets are valid for connecting travel to any metro or RER station within Paris.  The train takes around 35 minutes to Gare du Nord and 45 minutes to Denfert-Rochereau, making this the fastest way to get to the city. Tickets can be purchased either through green (sometimes blue) automated ticket vending machines (\"Billetterie \u00cele-de-France\") or through the ticket office serviced by transit authority personnel.\nThe automated ticket machines accept euro coins of \u20ac2, \u20ac1 and 50, 20, 10, 5 cent denominations and give change. 'Chip & PIN' credit card (typical in Europe and elsewhere) payment is OK on these machines, but cards from the US (or in general have only a magnetic strip or 'chip & signature'), you most likely will not be able to use your card.  In the airport stations there are separate automated machines which change \u20ac20, \u20ac10 and \u20ac5 notes to \u20ac2 and \u20ac1 coins. However, due to the high demand, the machines frequently run out of coins. The currency exchanges explicitly state notes will not be changed for coins. Because of these limitations, purchasing tickets from the ticket office may be your only option. Although there are many counters, the queues can be very long.\nTrains for Paris leave from platforms 11 and 12. Look for signs saying \"RER B\" or \"All trains go to Paris\". When using the ticket from and to the airport (as with tickets for the RER commuter trains in general) you have to use it to enter and to exit the quay areas.  Always keep the ticket handy as the SNCF officials sometimes check for tickets, and if you are without one you may be fined \u20ac40.  This means that after you put the ticket into the entry gate and are cleared to pass, you must retrieve the ticket from the machine and keep it with you until you leave the train system including any connections.\nDuring off-peak hours and on the weekends, if you're not in a hurry, avoid the trains from the airport heading to Saint R\u00e9my l\u00e8s Chevreuse: they will stop at all stations between the airport and Paris. Instead, wait a few minutes for a train heading to Massy-Palaiseau, it will be non-stop between the airport and Paris Gare du Nord (but won't overtake the omnibus train). If you're going to the airport, look on the information displays on the platforms: if the next train to A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle stops at a dozen of stations, the next one should go to Mitry-Claye, and then the following one will be non-stop from Paris Gare du Nord to the airport. But remember, this is only during off-peak hours, as well as all day on the weekends. For RER B trains terminating at A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle, the mission code displayed on the front of the train should begin with an \"E\" (EFLA, EPAU, etc.); do not take the RER B train where mission code displayed on the front of the train begins with an \"I\" (IDOR, INKE, etc.)\n\n\nBy bus to Paris\nThe Roissybus service (\u20ac16.20 in 2023) connects all terminals directly to Op\u00e9ra Garnier in central Paris, but it's subject to traffic jams and rush hour, so it averages 60 min but can lasts much longer if the traffic is bad. Mobilis and Ticket jeune tickets are not accepted on this line, but Paris Visite zone 1-5 is accepted.\nIf you're looking for cheap alternatives, you could take bus number 350 to Porte de la Chapelle (Metro line 12, tram line T3b, 45 minutes) or 351 to Paris Gallieni (Metro line 3, 60 minutes) or Place de la Nation (Metro line 1, 2, 6, 9, RER A, tram lines 3a, 3b, 90 minutes). They require a single T+ ticket per person (\u20ac1.90, \u20ac1.69 if bought by sets of 10, or \u20ac2 if the tickets are purchased on the bus).\nAlternatively, even cheaper is the bus Express 93 to Bobigny Pablo Picasso (Metro line 5, 35 minutes): only one ticket t+ is required, you will need another ticket to transfer to Metro line 5 (reaches Gare du Nord in 15 minutes). The bus leaves from \"Roissyp\u00f4le\", at the bus station located next to RER B \"A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 1-3\" / CDGVal \"Terminal 3 - Roissyp\u00f4le\" station.\nThe tickets can be purchased at newsstands, at ticket machines, or, for a higher price, inside the bus from the driver and they need to be validated with a device lying next to the driver's seat. Note that you cannot transfer from a bus to the metro or RER, but you can transfer from a bus to a tram or another bus up to 90 minutes after your first validation.\nThe former \"Le Bus Direct\" express bus services to central Paris and Orly (previously branded Air France) were withdrawn during the COVID pandemic and have not been reinstated.\nBy night, the Noctilien N143 buses serve CDG airport roughly every 30 min between 00:00 and 05:00. In Paris, they stop at Gare de l'Est, Gare du Nord, and Porte de la Chapelle, in CDG they stop in terminals 1, 2F and 3. In  You will need either 2 t+ tickets (\u20ac4 if bought on board, \u20ac3.80 if bought at a machine, \u20ac3.38 if bought by pack of 10 at a machine), or a Navigo, Mobilis, Ticket jeune, or Paris Visite, covering zones 1-5.\n\n\nFrom Paris to Charles de Gaulle Airport\nBe careful when using buses to get to CDG. There are frequent traffic jams on the motorways leading to the airport - the Bus Direct normally may need 50 minutes to get to CDG, but it can take 1\u00bd hours... your best bet for arriving on time with the buses is to take them very early in the morning or during times otherwise when there isn't much traffic.\nWhen you arrive at CDG, you should note what terminal you arrived at (2A, 2D, etc.), because when you come back to the airport to depart at the end of your trip, the RER subway train makes two stops at CDG to cover the three terminals, but there are few indications of which airlines are at which terminals. Have a close look at your air ticket to figure out which terminal you are departing from. Air France and associates leave from Terminal 2E/F/G, most Star Alliance airlines leave from Terminal 1 (excepted Air Canada which leaves from Terminal 2A), most charter and low-costs flights leave from Terminal 3 (easyJet leaves from Terminal 2D). The RER B has the airlines serviced by each terminal on a not so obvious chart posted by the door of the train.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBefore security\nTerminals, parking garages, hotels, the RER B stations, and the TGV station are linked by the free CDGVal, an automated people mover train. The train runs every 4 minutes and usually takes about 2 minutes between each stop. At peak hours expect heavy passenger loads.\nTerminal 2G is not connected to the main Terminal 2 building.  A navette (shuttle bus) connects passengers to and from Terminal 2E. The journey can take 15 to 20 minutes. It is important to allow for extra time if travelling through Terminal 2G.\n\n\nAfter security\nOnce you have gone through security or have arrived in Paris and need to connect (\"correspondances\") to another flight, it is very complicated to change terminals. You can walk around terminal 2 (for example from 2A to 2F), but from or to Terminal 1, Terminal 3, or Terminal 2G, you will need to take a bus. These buses can be very crowded and are not practical to use.\n\n\nWait\n\nPower outlets specifically for charging passengers' laptops/mobiles are widely available throughout the terminals, before and after security.\nPlane spotting is limited.  Serious photographers interested in exploring the airport grounds must apply for permission at the police pr\u00e9fecture in advance.\nThose with layovers longer than 5-6 hours, a quick trip into the city for lunch and a museum or shopping is possible.  Passengers with less than 5 hours should only consider visiting if they are experienced travellers or if they know the city well.\n\n\nLounges\n Aeroflot Lounge, Terminal 2C.

However it is important to know that once you are near your gate, it is long to get to another terminal. This is due to the sheer size of the terminals and the need to take a bus between the terminals that are detached from others (Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 for example which are detached from the larger Terminal 2, which itself has detached sub-terminals like Terminal 2G).\nAll terminals and most sub-terminals have at least one duty-free (BuY Paris).

Second -- have your tax refund papers stamped at the tax refund counter in the main terminal area, before you check in with your airline. Showing goods is signposted as mandatory, usually only required for high priced, marquee items.\nTo locate the tax refund counter in the terminal, look for the signs or ask any airline employee for directions. Don't be confused by a single line splitting between currency exchange and tax refund office: choose tax refund if you prefer euros \u2014 while currency exchange refunds only in US dollars or your national currency, both buy at a robbery rate (and with no rollback to the refund window after you realized the rate).\nThe line can take a long time, expect several minutes per customer. At either office, you can also receive refund for your spouse if you have their passport and refund forms.\n\n\nDuty-free shopping\nThere are no shops before security check zone. When you shop in post-security check zone, it's not genuinely tax-free, as you can receive a tax refund for those purchases as well.\nContrary to what one may expect, there is no L'Occitane; cheese is limited to soft sorts (and there are no ripe varieties); wines starts at \u20ac11 and some popular sorts like Chinon can't be found; selection of sausages is extremely limited.\nThere are no mid-range clothes or shoes stores, only luxury brands.\n\n\nTerminal 3\nAfter Security\n\n\nDuty Free (by terminal)\n BuY Paris Collection, Terminal 1, \u260f +33 1 74 37 12 79.
