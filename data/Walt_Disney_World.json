  "extract": "At Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake, Florida, you can explore human innovation and cooperation; enjoy rides both thrilling and enchanting; relax and recuperate on the beach or the golf course; and discover an entire resort where children and adults can have fun\u2014together.\nPlanning a trip to Walt Disney World puts you in good company; it is the flagship of Disney's worldwide theme park empire and is, by far, the most popular theme park resort in the world. Even amid numerous other attractions in and around Orlando, Florida, the Mouse House stands tall, the beacon that draws millions of tourists a year to the area. Some visitors describe it as a place of magic, wonder, and fantasy; others speak of fun, excitement, and relaxation; and still others complain of crowds, artifice, and unrelenting tackiness. As with most things, the essence of Walt Disney World lies near the intersection of those three views. It can be frustrating at times, but preparation and a positive attitude will smooth over most of the rough edges.\nThe centerpieces of Walt Disney World are the four theme parks: The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. Walt Disney World also has two of the world's most popular water parks, Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach, both heavily themed. Two shopping and entertainment districts, Disney Springs and Disney's Boardwalk, provide plenty of opportunities for retail therapy and nighttime fun. If none of that strikes your fancy, check out some of the lesser-known activities, such as golf, tennis, boating, fishing, spas and health clubs, backstage tours, sporting events, and character dining.\nSimply put, there is always something fun to do at Walt Disney World.\n\n\nDistricts\nWalt Disney World can be divided into five distinct areas\u2014one for each of the four theme parks, and Disney Springs. The various resort hotels, and the attractions and restaurants found within, are grouped with the nearest park.\n\nThe Magic Kingdom \u2014 Based on the original Disneyland in California, this is the oldest and most popular park of the complex; in fact, with over 17 million visitors annually, it's the most-visited single theme park in the world. This is the park people think of first when they think of Walt Disney World, a place where adventure meets fantasy and history meets the future. The Magic Kingdom has the most kid-friendly attractions and most of the classic rides beloved by kids-at-heart.\nEpcot \u2014 A sort of \"permanent World's Fair\", Epcot is dedicated to both international culture and technological innovation. The park is a combination of two disparate ideas. World Showcase takes you on a trip around the world as you visit themed pavilions filled with the art, architecture, people, and products of eleven different countries. Future World explores human achievements in pavilions dedicated to communication, imagination, conservation, and more.\nDisney's Boardwalk, a collection of restaurants, gift shops, and nightlife spots themed as a 1920s Eastern Seaboard boardwalk is not far from Epcot.\nDisney's Hollywood Studios \u2014 This park represents the \"Hollywood that never was,\" with attractions themed around movies and television. You'll find a variety of live shows and attractions based on Disney, Pixar, and Lucasfilm productions.\nDisney's Animal Kingdom \u2014 Not your average zoo, Animal Kingdom has a combination of live animals, foreign cultures, and traditional Disney magic. With an emphasis on understanding and conservation, Animal Kingdom is the largest and most diverse of the theme parks.\nDisney Springs \u2014 For more \"grown-up\" activities, Disney Springs has shopping, nightclubs, restaurants, and unique entertainment. This is where the most action is after dark. Disney Springs is divided into four areas: Marketplace, The Landing, Town Center, and West Side, each offering a slightly different mix of retail, food, entertainment, and nightlife.\nThe ESPN Wide World of Sports \u2014 a multi-sport complex primarily used for amateur athletic tournaments.  It has baseball, softball, tennis, track and field, basketball, gymnastics, volleyball, roller hockey, dance, and cheer facilities.\nBlizzard Beach \u2014 a water park themed as a melting ski resort.  With seven water slides(themed after slalom courses, bobsled, and toboggan runs) served by a chairlift, as well as a wave pool, lazy river, a children's pool.  Located near Disney's Animal Kingdom\nTyphoon Lagoon \u2014 a water park home to the world's largest wave pool. Located near Disney Springs\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\"I do not make films primarily for children. I make them for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty. Call the child 'innocence'. The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be. In my work I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living; showing it that laughter is healthy; showing it that the human species, although happily ridiculous at times, is still reaching for the stars.\"  \u2014 Walt Disney \nThe most important thing to understand about the Walt Disney World Resort is that it was designed to be fun for everyone. Don't make the mistake of staying away just because you don't have kids. Singles and couples without children who think a Walt Disney World vacation is just for kids ignore the many \"adult\" entertainments available throughout the resort. Foodies, sun-worshipers, world travelers, thrill-seekers, comedy-lovers, film devotees, sports fans, club-hoppers, and history buffs will all find plenty of ways to have a great time.\nOf course, if you do have kids, the best part of your Walt Disney World vacation is in experiencing the parks through their eyes. That is when you really understand Walt Disney's vision of a place where kids and parents can have fun together.\nWalt Disney World is enormous, a multi-day resort destination. Each of its four theme parks is big enough to occupy visitors for a full day (and often two, depending on crowds), not even accounting for Disney Springs, Disney golf courses, Disney's water parks, and other attractions. Many consider four days to be bare minimum length of visit to experience a majority of the resort; some people stay as long as two weeks and still don't see everything.\nTraveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families. The \"typical\" visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and returning home. There are infinite variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of \"going to Disney World\".\nEverything at Walt Disney World is carefully constructed and choreographed to maintain your perceptions of visiting an idealized world. Company jargon frames every aspect of customer service as part of the \"show\": employees are \"cast members\", visitors are \"guests\", and every prop and costume must be completely \"in-character\" while \"on-stage\". Disney considers the guest experience to be their top priority, and their customer service is almost universally impeccable. You will never find garbage lying in the streets or bathrooms that are too dirty, and anything that is damaged is either removed or fixed immediately. The streets are almost sparkling and the buildings look brand new no matter what time of the day or year you are there.\nWhile some people find this attention to detail cloying and artificial, the vast majority of visitors are happy to immerse themselves in this relaxing, carefree environment. Even so, the realities of Walt Disney World can be stark: long lines, sweltering heat, rude guests, and expensive merchandise are common. There are ways to avoid the worst elements (namely by carefully choosing when to visit), but if things do go wrong, you can rely on the cast members to try to make things right.\nMany first-time visitors try to do too much during their stay. Unless crowds are unusually small, this is a sure-fire recipe for burnout and exhaustion. You need to have a basic schedule in mind, but you should remain flexible in order to account for closed rides, full restaurants, special events, and just changing your mind. If the crowds get too heavy or the weather gets too hot, smart guests staying on-site head back to their hotels to relax, grab a snack, or take a swim, then return later in the day. Trying to adhere to a rigid schedule will only frustrate you and your family, and you're not going to Walt Disney World to get frustrated, are you?\nWith some careful basic planning, an open mind, and a cheerful attitude, a visit to Walt Disney World can be whatever you want it to be: fulfilling, exciting, relaxing, enlightening, or just plain fun.\n\n\nHistory\nBy the start of the 1960s, Disneyland went from \"Walt's folly\" to a success. Walt Disney had created not just an amusement park, where children could ride kiddie rides while their parents watched from a bench, but the world's first true theme park, a place where children and grown-ups could both have fun, together.\nBut it was not long after Disneyland's 1955 opening that Walt realized that the available space in Anaheim was too small. He had his park, but he and his Imagineers were constantly coming up with new ideas, ideas that just weren't going to fit inside Disneyland. In addition, market studies showed that only 5% of visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where the vast majority of the American population lived. In the 1960s, Walt began looking to the East Coast for a place with enough space to hold all of the ideas his team could dream up. He found such a place in Central Florida, southwest of the sleepy city of Orlando. Here, along the new Interstate 4, there was plenty of space, far more than would be needed for just a single theme park. Walt had grander ideas in mind for this \"Florida Project\" of his.\nAfter buying up over 27,000 acres (11,000 ha) of land on the sly, Walt announced his ambitious Disney World plans to the world. A theme park would be built, of course\u2014a Magic Kingdom on the north end of the property. But to get there from I-4, guests would need to pass through the true centerpiece of the project: EPCOT, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.\nEPCOT was Walt Disney's largest, most revolutionary idea yet\u2014a real city, with 20,000 real people living and working within, making use of the most advanced technologies to grow food, provide transport, and enhance quality of life. Much of the technology was already in use at Disneyland\u2014PeopleMovers and monorails, for instance\u2014but these would not be amusement rides. EPCOT was to be a place where the Imagineers' ideas were put to practical use, for the betterment of all mankind.\nAlas, it was not to be. Walt died in December 1966, just as the Florida Project was coming to fruition. Without Walt to drive the project, the company board refused to undertake the ambitious EPCOT plans. But Walt's brother Roy O. Disney insisted the project as a whole go forward, starting with the Magic Kingdom. Roy changed the project's name to  Walt Disney World; this new resort would be a tribute to Walt's vision, but would never really be the fulfillment of it.\nThe Magic Kingdom opened on October 1, 1971, with two hotels, a campground, and two golf courses nearby. It was an immediate success, single-handedly sparking the development of the Orlando area as one of the country's busiest vacation destinations. Though Roy died before the year ended, he had succeeded in getting his brother's final project off the ground.\nWalt Disney World's first decade passed quickly, and by the time of its \"Tencennial\" celebration in 1981, a new theme park was being built in the space Walt had envisioned for EPCOT. The new park would be called EPCOT Center, though it bore little resemblance to Walt's original plans. Instead, EPCOT Center would be a sort of \"permanent world's fair\", combining Future World, made up of grand pavilions devoted to human progress, with a World Showcase of meticulously detailed recreations of foreign lands. EPCOT Center opened in 1982, and was followed by a combination theme park and movie studio called Disney-MGM Studios in 1989, and then by Disney's Animal Kingdom, a zoological theme park, in 1998.\nOver the years, numerous resort hotels and recreational activities were added to support the increased attendance at the multi-park resort. Two large water parks were added in 1989 and in 1995. In addition, a remote area of the property that started as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village evolved into the Disney Village Marketplace, expanded to become Downtown Disney, and is now Disney Springs, an adult-oriented shopping and entertainment district.\nWalt Disney never would have imagined what Walt Disney World has become, and it is far removed from his original vision. But one of his guiding principles was to \"keep moving forward\", and Disney World has done just that, becoming the largest and most popular theme park resort complex in the world.\n\n\nRead\nEnough books have been written about Walt Disney World to fill a good-sized bookshelf. One very educational set of books, though written in 2009, are the Imagineering Field Guides; there's one for each of the four parks (plus one for Disneyland). These guides aren't about practical tourist information; rather, they cover the stories behind every area in each park and feature great concept images (some rarely seen), behind-the-scenes details, and tricks of the Imagineering trade. They're also small enough to carry in your pocket should you wish to learn more about the process of making of the areas as you tour the parks.\nSurprisingly, not much fiction has been written about the parks themselves. Ridley Pearson has an ongoing series of young-adult novels set inside the parks, called The Kingdom Keepers. Carole Marsh has written The Mystery at Walt Disney World as part of her Real Kids, Real Places mystery series. There's also Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, a science-fiction novel by Cory Doctorow that takes place primarily in a future version of the Magic Kingdom.\n\n\nWatch\nThe Walt Disney Company is a multinational media conglomerate, so video productions featuring Walt Disney World are ubiquitous.\nSeveral television programs have filmed on-location at the resort. The 1990s-era revival of The Mickey Mouse Club (the one that gave Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake their starts) was filmed entirely at the production facilities inside Disney-MGM Studios (now Hollywood Studios). Full House, Family Matters, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and Black-ish, are among the sitcoms (mostly on Disney-owned ABC) with episodes showing the characters visiting Walt Disney World. Another fun option, if you can find it, is 1990's The Muppets at Walt Disney World, which was intended as a precursor to Disney's purchase of the Muppets (which finally happened in 2004).\nThose shows only used the park as a backdrop, though, so they have limited \"tourist\" value. For meatier fare, there's always the yearly Disney Parks' Magical Christmas Celebration, which features the Walt Disney World Christmas parade and also includes segments showing the latest and greatest attractions around both Disneyland and Walt Disey World. If you're going to watch the special just to get planning information, though, you might as well just call Disney at \u260f +1 407 W-DISNEY (9-347639) and ask for their free vacation planning video. Another good source of information is the official YouTube channel of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. No surprise that these Disney corporate sources tend to gloss over the problems you might encounter at Walt Disney World, but they do offer a good introduction to the resort for first-timers who are trying to get a feel for the place.\nDisney has also made a few full-length features based on various rides in the parks\u2014the five Pirates of the Caribbean films being by far the best\u2014but don't expect the rides to have much of anything to do with the films. They're a good way to get into the mood for your trip, though!\n\n\nClimate\n\nLike all of Central Florida, the climate at Walt Disney World is humid and subtropical. Summer (May\u2013October) is hot and sticky, while winter (November\u2013April) is mild and drier. Visitors from higher latitudes are often surprised by the sheer intensity of the summer sun in Florida, which can rise to within a few degrees of straight overhead in June and July. In June through September, late afternoon thundershowers are very common; plan accordingly.\nThat said, climate problems are well known at Walt Disney World and there are several means to cope (see \"Weather\" in the Stay Safe section).\nInclement weather can often lead to the temporary closure of outdoor rides and live performances. In the case of rides, they will re-open after the weather improves, and your Lighting Lane selections will continue to be valid, even if your reservation time has passed. Live performances may be either delayed or canceled outright. On the other hand, inclement weather could work to your advantage, as it drives some visitors away from outdoor areas, or out of the parks entirely.\n\n\nWhen to visit\nThere used to be some times of year when the parks were relatively deserted, but not so much anymore. Now they just vary from \"moderately busy\" to \"completely insane\". Still, deciding when to go remains a game of trade-offs: you must decide whether to favor lower crowds or longer park hours, and decide whether you prefer scorching days or chilly nights.\nThe peak periods for attendance are late December, mid-June to mid-August, and mid-February to mid-April. Why? That's when most American kids are on break from school. If you have kids, you may have no choice but to go during these peak times. The bad news is that you'll be packed like sardines next to 50,000 of your new closest friends, you'll wait two hours to go on rides like Space Mountain and Soarin', and you'll be paying a premium for the privilege. In the summer, you also get to listen to the kids complain about the heat. On the bright side, though, you'll have plenty of company, the parks are guaranteed to be open late, and as many rides as possible will be up and running.\nIf your schedule allows any flexibility at all, you should avoid these peak periods. Attendance is lowest in October, November (pre-Thanksgiving), December (pre-Christmas), and January. These can be very good times to go; crowds are low and prices are too, but keep in mind that you may find that several rides are shut down for maintenance, and the parks have shorter operating hours. In the winter, it's often too cold to go to the water parks, and you'll need a jacket at night.\nThe weeks between Easter and Memorial Day are another slow period, as well as the months of August and September; both periods provide a good balance of price, crowds, temperature, and operating hours, but you may need to take the kids out of school if you're bringing them along.\nBe aware, however, during the periods of mid-December to February, mid-June to July, during the first 2-3 weeks of October, and on Thanksgiving Day (in some cases), tour groups from South American countries, mainly from Brazil and Argentina, will invade Walt Disney World and other Orlando theme parks. Many guests have complained of rudeness and improper supervision. There may be some groups that may not be as problematic as everyone could think, but still, if you see or hear a group of teens behind or more 20- to 30-year-old adult(s) with a flag, your best bet is to go in the opposite direction.\nOf course, you may want to coordinate your trip with a special event. (It's no coincidence that these events are scheduled during otherwise-slow periods for the parks.) Epcot has two months-long events: the Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival runs from March to mid-May, and the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival runs from October through mid-November.\nThe Magic Kingdom hosts two special hard-ticket holiday events, Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party in September and October, and Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party in November and December. These events, which let you stay in the park past the normal closing time, can cost up to $150 per person(on top of regular park admission), but tickets are limited so the crowds remain manageable.\n\nSpeaking of Christmas, the month of December may just be the most magical time of year at Walt Disney World. The entire resort goes all-out to decorate everything, with huge themed Christmas trees in each of the parks and each of the resorts, and the spectacular Castle Dreamlights draped onto Cinderella Castle. There are also countless holiday events at the resorts, the Candlelight Processional at Epcot, and other events. And as long as you avoid Thanksgiving week and Christmas week, the crowds really aren't that bad.\n\n\nTiming\nIf your vacation dates are flexible, plan to arrive to the Orlando area on Thursday. Friday and Saturday are transition days for park visitors, especially in the summer months. Saturdays do draw in more Annual Pass holders to the park, but that is the major day that people either arrive or leave the area. This causes attendance figures to be down, making it a perfect day to visit the parks.\nIf you are planning to have a day of rest in your vacation, by arriving on Thursday you can enjoy two days of parks with reduced crowds and then use Sunday to rest. If during those first two days you are planning to visit the Magic Kingdom, plan to do it on Friday. Attendance figures pick up for that park on Saturday. You will be able to do more attractions in the first two days while you are revved up, and then it will allow you to relax and enjoy the park on the more crowded days.\n\n\nTalk\nAs in most places in the United States, English is the default language throughout the Walt Disney World Resort. The cast members at World Showcase in Epcot are largely citizens of the featured countries, and so will be fluent in their native tongues as well as English. Other cast members throughout the property may also be bi- or tri-lingual; any such cast members can be identified by language signs on their nametags, representing the languages they speak. Like most of Florida Spanish is  very common, as is to a lesser extent Haitian Creole.  \nAll four theme parks have an information center known as Guest Relations, near the main entrance. Cast members at those locations, who are often multilingual, can answer any questions you may have.\nDisney's Ears to the World is an audio headset that provides foreign-language translations of the dialogues of selected attractions in French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, or Spanish. It may be rented at Guest Relations, but there are a limited number of them available; a $25 deposit will be collected and refunded upon return.\nGuests with visual disabilities can borrow Disney's Handheld Device. It's a portable wireless device that provides audio descriptions for most shows and attractions throughout the resort. Disney also provides Braille guidebooks. You can get either one at any park's Guest Relations location for a $25 refundable deposit. The largest counter-service restaurants now also offer Braille menus, and you can always ask a cast member to read the menu to you if needed.\nOddly enough, hearing-impaired guests can also use Disney's Handheld Device; it provides both captioning and assistive listening services for most attractions and shows. The $25 refundable deposit still applies. Some attractions may have (free) handheld, reflective, or video captioning available; ask a cast member. One park per day will have live interpreters for select shows; email WDPRsignlanguageservices@disney.com for the current schedule. Interpreters are available for special events and dinner shows by appointment at least two weeks in advance. Cast members with knowledge of American Sign Language can be identified by the appropriate symbol on their name tags.\nDeaf and hard-of-hearing guests can have any Disney guest room equipped with visual alerts, bed shakers, and TTYs; \u260f +1 407-824-4321, +1 407-827-5141 (TTY).\n\n\nGet in\n\n\"A person should set his goals as early as he can and devote all his energy and talent to getting there. With enough effort, he may achieve it. Or he may find something that is even more rewarding. But in the end, no matter what the outcome, he will know he has been alive.\"  \u2014 Walt Disney\n\n\nBy plane\n\nMost visitors fly into Orlando International Airport (MCO IATA), +1 407-825-2001. It is served by all of the major US airlines and a wide range of international carriers. From there, you can get to Disney in a number of ways \u2014 by renting a car, taking a taxi, ordering a limo or towncar, or taking Mears Connect, a bus service that takes you from the airport to your resort ($32 USD per adult, $27 USD per child aged 3-9, round trip). The most affordable option for getting to Disney is the Lynx Bus Route 311, which connects the airport directly to Disney for only $2, and is highly recommended for anyone not planning on renting a car (though it only runs to Disney Springs, and thus requires a transfer to a Disney-run bus to get to most of the resorts and parks). For those driving in, Florida State Roads 528 (to the north) and 417 (to the south) link the airport with Interstate 4, which leads directly into Walt Disney World.   \nOrlando-Sanford International Airport (SFB IATA) is a bit farther away from Walt Disney World than Orlando International. The airport is only served by ultra-low-cost carriers Allegiant and Flair.  Florida State Road 417 connects the airport to Interstate 4.\nDisney resorts offer airport check-in services (including baggage checking) right at the hotel, near the motorcoach  stop. This service is available for domestic (and soon international) flights on all major U.S. airlines (including Alaska Airlines). You can check-in in the morning, check your large bags, leave your carry-ons with Bell Services, and go have fun in the parks before you leave for the airport.\n\n\nBy car\nInterstate 4 is the most direct driving route into Walt Disney World. Depending on your point of origin, Florida's Turnpike can be quite useful. This is particularly true when you might be arriving from Miami or other points south. If you will be arriving from a cruise at Port Canaveral, Florida State Road 528 gets you to I-4, with Orlando International Airport and the Turnpike en route.  I-4 is the most dangerous road in Florida, and one of the worst in the United states.  See Florida#By car.  \n\n\nBy train\nAmtrak's Silver Service Miami\u2013New York City routes serve Orlando and Kissimmee. Service is four times daily, with two trains in either direction. Northbound trains from Miami arrive at the Orlando station at 1:43 PM and 7:08 PM; southbound trains from NYC arrive at 10:17 AM and 12:55 PM. The Auto Train, which can carry both passengers and automobiles, serves nearby Sanford non-stop from Lorton, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.).\nAlthough the Kissimmee station is much smaller, it is closer to both the Magic Kingdom and all the resorts on the southern end of Walt Disney World including the All-Star Resorts. The smaller distance translates into smaller taxi fares for those who are not planning on renting a car. It is also possible to take the Lynx Link 56 from here to the Transportation & Ticket Center.\nIf you are coming from Volusia or Seminole counties, or from northern Osceola county on a weekday and want to avoid I-4 Traffic, your best option is SunRail, which runs between Debary and Poniciana (and will also connect Deland from starting during the summer of 2024). There is no service on weekends and some federal holidays (for example, Thanksgiving and Christmas Day), and the trains run every 30 minutes during rush hour periods, and less often during off peak periods. There are three connecting stations for Disney served by SunRail. The first is Lynx Central Station in Downtown Orlando, the others are the Sand Lake Road station near the airport, and in Downtown Kissimmee.  The station physically closest to Disney is \"Tupperware\", there is no bus connection, but taxis and rideshares can be hailed.\nBrightline Runs from Orlando International Airport to Miami, with other intermediate stops in the Miami area.  Plans are underway to continue the route from the Airport to Walt Disney World, and eventually to Tampa. Brightline trains operate on separate tracks and stations than Amtrak and local commuter trains (which are shared with each other). $20-350 roundtrip.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe Disney Cruise Line provides a bus service for their passengers, between the Walt Disney World resort hotels and their terminal at Port Canaveral. The one-way fare is $35 per person, although it's included in the price if you book a land-and-sea vacation package.\nIf you're not staying at a Disney resort, or aren't coming in via Orlando International or Disney Cruise Line, you do have some other choices. Mears Transportation is the big dog in the area; in fact, Disney contracts with them to run the Magical Express and the Disney Cruise Line buses. But they also run their own shuttle buses and town cars that can take you to any of the local attractions or hotels.\nLong-distance bus company Greyhound serves both Orlando and Kissimmee, with the latter being closer to Walt Disney World.\n\nGreyhound terminals:\n Orlando Terminal, 555 N John Young Pkwy, \u260f +1 407 292-3424. \n Kissimmee Terminal, 103 E Dakin Ave, \u260f +1 407 847-3911. \nLYNX is a public bus service of the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority. Ten LYNX routes provide service between Walt Disney World and the surrounding area. All except 56 travel via I-4 and Disney Springs and serve the Disney Springs West Side Transfer Center.\n\nRegular routes:\nRoute 350, from Disney Springs, to SeaWorld, Destination Parkway and downtown Orlando. This route serves as WDW's primary public transit connection to International Drive, the main tourism corridor within the city of Orlando. This also is the main connector to SunRail from Lynx Central Station.\nRoute 56, from the Transportation and Ticket Center to the Downtown Kissimmee. This also is the main connector to SunRail and also Amtrak from Kissimmee.\nRoute 300, running nonstop express from Downtown Orlando to Disney Springs and the Transportation and Ticket Center, and vice-versa. This also is the main connector to SunRail from Lynx Central Station.\nRoute 311, from Disney Springs to MCO via the Orange County Convention Center, Universal Drive, and the Florida Mall.\nRoutes 301\u2013306, and 312 are commuter routes with very limited service:\nRoute 301, to/from Pine Hills.\nRoute 302, from the Magic Kingdom resorts to Rosemont.\nRoute 303, to and from Washington Shores.\nRoute 304, from Disney Springs to Rio Grande.\nRoute 306, from Disney Springs to Poinciana.\nRoute 312, to and from Ocoee via the TTC\n\n\nTickets\n\nVisiting Walt Disney World is a very expensive affair, but you have some leeway in determining just how expensive. Your most basic ticket covers the cost of visiting one of the four theme parks a day for each day of the ticket (up to 10 days). While single-day tickets are very pricey, especially for the Magic Kingdom, buying multiple-day tickets makes for a much lower per-day cost.\nOn top of the base ticket, you can add the Park Hopper option, which allows you to enter multiple theme parks on the same day as many times as you like. This option costs a flat $75 per ticket (or $60 for tickets less than four days). For an extra $15 per ticket, you can upgrade Park Hopper to Park Hopper Plus. In addition to the regular Park Hopper benefit, Park Hopper Plus incorporates the benefits of the old \"Water Park Fun & More\" option, granting admission to the two Disney water parks as well as other attractions.\nThe benefits of the Park Hopper option are often overlooked, but it's strongly recommended because of the flexibility it offers. Without it, you could be stuck with nowhere else to go after doing everything you want to do at one park; or you could run out of time to do one last attraction and be unable to come back another day to pick it up. If you have seven-day tickets, it costs just $10 per ticket per day to add this option; the value of being able to visit one park in the morning and another in the evening should not be underestimated. (Of course, if you have enough days on your tickets, maybe you don't need to worry about park hopping; you may have enough days to see everything you want to see without it.)\nWith the Park Hopper Plus option, you receive a number of admissions to attractions outside the four main parks. The number is equal to the number of days on your base ticket (or two admissions for one-day tickets), though they can be used anytime. You can use these admissions at Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, DisneyQuest, ESPN Wide World of Sports, and the nine-hole Oak Trail golf course. You can also use an admission for a round of golf at the Fantasia Gardens or Winter Summerland miniature golf courses, but only before 4PM. Depending on which attractions you visit, the cost of the option may be covered by the money you save on just one visit.\nDon't forget that you can always add Park Hopper later in your trip, just by paying the $75 (or $60) cost for the option. This change may be made at any ticket window or at the Guest Relations office inside each theme park as well as the Concierge desk at Disney Resort Hotels.\nAnother option you can add to your tickets is Memory Maker ($149/ticket), which allows unlimited downloads of all PhotoPass photos and videos, as well as discounts on prints. It's not available for one-day tickets. Neither this nor the Park Hopper option is likely worth it if you buy only a one- or two-day ticket, but because they have a flat cost, their value goes up sharply as you add more days.\nMulti-day tickets do not have to be used on consecutive days. However, these tickets will expire 14 days after they are first used, so be sure to use all the days purchased prior to that. Unused tickets expire at the end of the following calendar year; those purchased in 2024 will be good through the end of 2025, for instance. (Even if your ticket expires, though, you can still redeem its cost toward the purchase of a new ticket.)\n\nChildren under age three are admitted for free. The prices below were accurate as of February 2017 (6.5% Florida sales tax not included):\n\nThe two Disney water parks have different admission prices. They are $74 ($68 for ages 3\u20139), and you can freely hop between both water parks (if they're both open) for no additional charge. These tickets are good anytime, but if you know you won't be using them during the summer, you can get discounted \"blackout\" tickets for $10 less. Blackout tickets can't be used between Memorial Day and the end of August.  Water park tickets for DVC members and Annual Passholders are only $49 ($43 for ages 3\u20139).  \nDisney resort guests (those staying on-site at Disney hotels) are usually best served by getting package deals that include both lodging and admission. Magic Your Way Packages include discounts on dining, shopping, and other experiences as well as vouchers for miniature golf. (So pay attention to what your package includes before you add on the Water Park Fun and More option!) There are Magic Your Way Premium and Magic Your Way Platinum packages available as well; they add some interesting luxury options to your vacation package. They both include the Deluxe Dining Plan, preferred fireworks viewing, unlimited access to select recreational activities, tours, and a portrait session. The Platinum package adds to that a spa treatment, a fireworks cruise, and more. If you're sure you're going to use the benefits these packages provide, they may just be worth the extra cost. Purchasing these packages does require booking and staying at a Disney owned resort hotel.\nFlorida residents who provide proof of residence get discounts of varying degrees, but they can't purchase beyond a 7-day ticket (meaning that Florida residents who ask for the discount can't purchase 8-, 9-, or 10-day tickets). Annual passes are also available for frequent visitors or residents.\n\n\nGet around\n\nGetting around Walt Disney World is easy and often fun. You may walk, drive, or ride public transit (in this case, buses, monorails, or ferryboats). All Walt Disney World transit vehicles are wheelchair-accessible, and there is no additional fee to use any of them. If you are traveling with a stroller, you must take your child out of the stroller, then fold it and hand-carry it onto the vehicle.\n\n\nBy foot\nIn some places, walking is the most convenient way to travel from one area to another. Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and the five resorts in between (Swan & Dolphin, Yacht & Beach Clubs, and Boardwalk) are connected by walkways, as is Disney Springs to Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort. If you are staying at Disney's Contemporary Resort, you will find it quicker to walk to the Magic Kingdom than to take the ferry or monorail. From Shades of Green (a military-only resort) it's a five-minute walk to Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, to take the monorail or ferry to the Magic Kingdom; and from the Polynesian it's another five-minute walk to the Transportation and Ticket Center, to take the monorail to Epcot.\nKeep in mind, though, that you'll be doing a lot of walking within the parks, especially at Epcot and Animal Kingdom, so don't tire yourself out early!\nStrollers, wheelchairs, and electric convenience vehicles (ECVs) are readily available to rent at the entrance to each park. If you have a problem standing too long, or if walking on the hot pavement makes your feet ache, renting a wheelchair or ECV can make a big difference. Wheelchairs can be brought up to the loading area of most rides, where you'll usually need to transfer to the ride vehicle. Both wheelchairs and ECVs are accommodated in most theater and stage attractions. Strollers will usually need to be left outside; most attractions have a designated stroller parking area. Electric standing vehicles (ESVs) are also available for guests who have trouble walking, but also cannot sit for long periods of time. There are very few ESVs, though, so it might be a bit of a hassle to rent one.  Free wheelchairs are available to assist guests to and from the park entrance.  \nA single stroller rents for $15, or $13/day for multi-day rentals. Double strollers are $31, or $27/day. Wheelchairs are $12, or $10/day. ECVs and ESVs are $50, with a $20 refundable deposit. Even if you park-hop, you only have to pay once per day; simply show a same-day receipt to avoid paying a second fee.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nLearn to love the ubiquitous Walt Disney World bus system. You'll be using it a lot, especially if you didn't bring a car.\nThe bus routes are set up to facilitate travel from a resort to a park, but not from one resort to another or from one park to another. Most resorts have five bus routes originating from them, providing direct service to all four theme parks and Disney Springs. Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach are served only by buses that leave from Disney Springs and Animal Kingdom, respectively.\nDisney's Boardwalk is actually part of a resort, so visitors from other resorts (except Swan/Dolphin or Yacht/Beach Clubs) will have to travel there via one of the parks. The most convenient option is Disney's Hollywood Studios, which has two connections to the Boardwalk: walking or ferry. (Although Epcot is the closest park to the Boardwalk, using it as an interchange is not recommended, as it would require entering through the main entrance and exiting out the back entrance, thereby costing the admission fee.)\nThere is no bus service to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot from the Magic Kingdom-area resorts; they are served by the monorail system. Likewise, service to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios from the Epcot-area resorts is by ferry or walking. There is also no consistent direct bus service between the theme parks and Disney Springs. (After 4PM you can find buses from the parks to Disney Springs, but not the other way around; this discourages guests from parking for free at Disney Springs and taking the bus to the parks.) To travel to Disney Springs from a theme park, or vice versa, you must travel to any resort and change buses. The most convenient resort for this purpose is Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort, which is right next door to Disney Springs; you can get there via a pedestrian bridge, bus, or ferry.\nThe buses are reliable, fairly efficient, and reasonably comfortable, but you do need to give yourself plenty of time to get where you're going. You may wait up to twenty minutes for a bus to your destination, and another ten to thirty minutes to get there\u2014possibly longer during the busy season. The buses can be very crowded around park opening and closing times; be prepared to stand. Also keep in mind that guests in wheelchairs and ECVs have first priority when boarding.\nBusses to and from resorts not operated by Disney(like Shades of Green, Swan&Dolphin, or the Four Seasons) only serve the TTC, not the Magic Kingdom directly.   \n\n\nBy monorail\n\nWalt Disney World's monorail system is one of its signature attractions, and it's not even inside one of the parks. They do a great job of getting large numbers of guests from place to place, but they're also quite comfortable and fun to ride.\nThe monorail service is limited and only goes to certain areas, all originating from the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC). There are three monorail lines:\n\nExpress: This route travels from the Transportation and Ticket Center (adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot) to the Magic Kingdom gates and back, without stopping at the resorts. This is primarily used by Magic Kingdom guests who parked in the lot or are coming from Epcot. This route runs on the outer beam, counter-clockwise around Seven Seas Lagoon.\nResort: This route runs parallel to the Express route, clockwise on the inner rail, and stops at all the resorts it passes. The stops are, in order: Transportation and Ticket Center, Polynesian Village, Grand Floridian, Magic Kingdom, and Contemporary. This route is used by resort guests to get to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot, and by guests visiting one of the resorts.\nEpcot: This route travels between the Transportation and Ticket Center and the Epcot gates. When entering Epcot this way, the monorail makes a nice loop in the park before arriving at the station, giving a great aerial view of Future World and the World Showcase.\nIf you are going to Epcot from the Polynesian Village Resort, you may walk to the Transportation and Ticket Center to get to the Epcot monorail; it's usually faster than taking the Resort monorail completely through the loop. The same is true of traveling to the Magic Kingdom from the Contemporary Resort. It is also possible to walk to the TTC from Disney's Wilderness Lodge, which is not connected to the monorail. The distance is about half a mile, and takes around 10 minutes.\nMonorails generally run from an hour before park opening to an hour after closing. Most of the time that'll be enough for anyone, but if you're using it to transit between resorts (for, say, a late dinner reservation), you might want to double-check the exact hours at your resort's front desk. You might also have a problem with early-morning breakfasts and tour appointments, but again the front desk can help you arrange alternative transportation.\n\n\nBy boat\nWalt Disney World also has several waterways which are used by ferryboats to transport guests. In some cases, these take the place of bus service between two destinations.\nFrom the Magic Kingdom:\n\nFerryboats transport guests to the Transportation and Ticket Center, adjacent to the parking lot.\nGold Flag boats serve the Grand Floridian and Polynesian resorts.\nRed Flag boats serve the Wilderness Lodge.\nGreen Flag boats serve Fort Wilderness Campground.\nBlue Flag boats operate in a triangle between the Contemporary Resort, Fort Wilderness, and Wilderness Lodge.  This boat is intended for Hoop-Dee-Doo Revue guests, does not serve the Magic Kingdom, and only runs after 3 PM.\nFrom other parks:\n\nFriendship boats travel from EPCOT to the Swan/Dolphin, Yacht/Beach Club, Boardwalk, and Hollywood Studios.\nSassagoula Riverboats sail from Disney Springs to Saratoga Springs, Old Key West, and the two Port Orleans resorts.\n\n\nBy car\nIf you are staying on-site, a car is not necessary, unless you wish to travel off-property during your stay. Some people purchase groceries to use during their stay; while there are a couple of places on the property to buy them, better selection and prices are found off property. Other people use a car to avoid the delays that can sometimes affect the public transportation options.\nIf you are staying at a hotel off Disney property, on the other hand, a car is strongly recommended. Many off-resort hotels offer shuttle service to the parks, but the schedules may not be convenient.\nGetting around Walt Disney World by car is not much of a problem. All you need to do is follow the purple directional signs with black Mickey Mouse ears to your destination. Your WDW resort will also provide a map of the complex. If you run into problems, just drop by the Walt Disney World Car Care Center on World Drive, near the Magic Kingdom toll plaza.\nThe four golf courses (see below) are accessible only by car; however, complimentary taxi service is available for guests of Disney-owned hotels.\n\n\nRent\nSeveral car rental agencies have locations on Walt Disney World property:\n\nAlamo and National, which are both owned by the same company, have dual locations in three places:\nWDW Car Care Center (near the Magic Kingdom toll plaza), +1 407 824-3470\nWalt Disney World Dolphin Hotel, +1 407 934-4930\nHilton Buena Vista Palace (in the Disney Springs Resort Area), +1 407 827-6363\nAvis at the Hilton Lake Buena Vista in the Disney Springs Resort Area. +1 407 827-2847\nBudget at the DoubleTree in the Disney Springs Resort Area. +1 407 827-6089\nDollar at the Wyndham in the Disney Springs Resort Area. +1 407 583-8000\nHertz at Shades of Green. +1 407 938-0600\nU-Save at the Best Western in the Disney Springs Resort Area. +1 407 938-9585\n\n\nFuel\nThere are three Speedway gas stations within the resort: at the Car Care Center on World Drive, on Buena Vista Drive near the entrance to Hollywood Studios, and on Buena Vista Drive across from Disney Springs. Don't worry too much about paying a premium for convenience; these three stations are often the cheapest in the area. If you do go off-property for fuel, check prices very carefully. Some stations take advantage of unwary tourists by charging $1-3 a gallon more than the local market rate.\n\n\nParking\nThe parking fee at the four theme park lots is $30 for most vehicles (campers, trailers, buses, and tractor trailers are $35.) Parking is free for pass holders, but as of 2018 there is a charge for those staying at on-site resorts. The four theme park lots are huge, and are divided into subsections; this is to enable you to remember your car's location. To save you from having to walk the long distances, there are trams that will shuttle you from the parking lot to the park gates and back (except in the case of the Magic Kingdom, where the tram will take you to the Transportation and Ticket Center, from which you may take the ferry or the monorail to the park). \"Preferred Parking\" may be available, for $45-$55 depending on how busy the park is that day.  \nParking at the two water parks and at Disney Springs is free. However, there are no parking lot trams available, so be prepared to walk.  Valet parking is also available at Disney Springs for $20.  There is no overnight pakring allowed at Disney Springs. \nValet parking is available at Deluxe resorts (see the Sleep section) for $39/night, but also allows guests to park at the theme parks for free. Self-parking is free at the resorts for both day and overnight guests.\nChargePoint electric vehicle charing stations are available at all four theme parks and Disney Springs.\n\n\nBy Minnie Van\n Minnie Van (Booked via Lyft app), \u260f +1 407-939-7777. Walt Disney World offers a ridesharing system called the Minnie Van, offering direct, door-to-door service within the resort and nearby areas. Most Minnie Vans are six-seater SUVs, equipped with child safety seats.  Minnie Vans are booked on the Lyft mobile app or by phone, and are operated by Disney Transport cast members.  Accessible vans with space for wheelchairs or other mobility devices are also available.  These are often the fastest, if most expensive, route between any two points on the resort. Distance based, usually $20-$50; $199 flat rate to/from MCO.  (updated May 2024)\n\n\nSee and do\n\"Here in Florida, we have something special we never enjoyed at Disneyland \u2014 the blessing of size. There's enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we can possibly imagine.\"  \u2014 Walt Disney \nThere is a lot to do at Walt Disney World, and only some of it involves standing in lines or meeting Mickey Mouse. In fact, there's so much to do that you simply can't do it all; don't even try! Instead, prioritize. Of course you have to visit the theme parks, but not necessarily every day. Leave time for shopping, boating, dining, swimming, golfing, and relaxing.\nThe people who really enjoy Walt Disney World, the ones who return like clockwork, know how to balance time in the parks with time outside the parks. And both can be equally magical.\n\n\nMyMagic+\nIn 2013, Disney unveiled MyMagic+, their brand name for a whole suite of new innovations intended to improve their guests' experiences at Walt Disney World. There are three major components: My Disney Experience, MagicBands, and Lightning Lanes.\n\n\nMagicBands\n\nDisney's Key to the World cards have largely been superseded by their new MagicBands. MagicBands are rubber wristbands that you can wear all day around the parks. Each member of your party gets one, and you use it to gain admittance to the parks and access FastPass+ queues. If you're staying at a Disney resort, the MagicBand will also unlock your hotel room, and you can use it to charge purchases to your room account or access meal options from your Disney Dining Plan. The MagicBands use RFID wireless technology, so all you have to do is wave your wrist near a special Mickey-head sensor, and you're all set.\nIf you are staying at a Disney resort, you can have each member of your party pick a color, and Disney will send you your MagicBands ahead of time. (If not, you can still use MagicBands, but you'll have to buy them for $12.95 each once you get to the park.) Disney sells decorations for your MagicBands, so you can customize their look. The Tomorrowland Power and Light store in the Magic Kingdom also has a MagicBand on Demand facility, which allows you to customize special MagicBands on the spot. They're $21.95 with just your choice of artwork, or $29.95 if you want to add your name as well.\nMagicBands sent to your home before your trip are automatically linked to your My Disney Experience account (see next section); if you get them later, you'll need to have them linked at the point of purchase.\n\n\nMy Disney Experience\nMy Disney Experience is an integrated platform, a one-stop shop for all of your trip information.\nSetting up an account using the web site and connecting it to your trip reservation allows you to access all of your reservations: your Disney hotel stay, your FastPass+ times, and your Advance Dining Reservations. (It also lets you choose your MagicBand colors ahead of time!) Even if you're not staying at a Disney resort, you can create an account and hook it up to your admission media (MagicBand or card) once you get to the parks. You can review and make changes to your FastPass+ choices or ADRs both from the site and from the My Disney Experience mobile app (iOS or Android only).\nDisney is starting to provide online ordering and payment at counter-service restaurants, starting with Satu'li Canteen in Animal Kingdom. This feature of the app will allow you to skip the lines and just go get your food when it's ready.\nThe app has a number of other features, too, like an interactive park map, current attraction wait times, and access to your PhotoPass photos and videos. Need to know what restaurants are near your current location? Want to know when your favorite character is going to be posing for photos? Or what time the 3PM parade starts? This app has the answers. While it's never a good idea to wander the parks with your eyes locked on your mobile phone all day, the usefulness of the My Disney Experience app means you probably don't want to leave it in your hotel room, either. No wonder Disney has been improving wi-fi access throughout the resort!\n\n\nGenie+/Lightning Lanes\nAt their busiest, lines at Disney's theme parks can be over three hours long for the most popular attractions. (During the least busy times, you'll rarely see more than 45 minutes, though.) As great as the attractions are, they are rarely worth standing in a three-hour line. One option for avoiding these lines is the service known as Genie+, available at pretty much every attraction that experiences wait times of more than a few minutes. Genie+ allows you to schedule your visit to an attraction ahead of time, and then enter the attraction using a dedicated queue that bypasses the standby line.\nGenie+ replaces the old FastPass system, in which you had to visit the attraction, get a FastPass ticket, and then come back at a designated time, and the FastPass+ system, which allowed you to reserve several rides, shows, and attractions up to 60 days in advance. Now with Genie+, you no longer have to keep track of paper tickets; your scheduled ride reservations are stored on your admission media (card or MagicBand). Guests that buy access to Genie+ at $15 USD per person per day can make a selection beginning as early as 7 AM at the park they hold a Park Pass reservation. Guests can only hold one Lightning Lane (the new name for the FastPass/FastPass+ lanes at each ride) at a time, unless it's been 2 hours since they booked one and the window hasn't yet arrived. Once you use a Lightning Lane reservation, or if the window lapses without it being used, the guest can make a new reservation.\nOne ride at each park is kept outside the limits of Genie+; to bypass the standby line at these rides (Seven Dwarves Mine Train at Magic Kingdom, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at EPCOT, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance at Hollywood Studios, and Avatar: Flight of Passage at Animal Kingdom), each rider will have to pay an additional fee. As of August 2022, the price for these rides range from $10 USD to $15 USD per rider.\nIf the demand is high, you might find that you can't get a Lightning Lane reservation for your preferred attraction, or it may not have any reservations until much later in the day. Early indications are that this should be rare, but it could happen. Also, be aware that the Lighting Lane queues may bypass some or all of the scenery and theming found in the longer lines, which for some guests is a significant part of the Disney experience. Consider what you may be missing if you choose to get a Lightning Lane reservation.\nGenie+ is still being tweaked, so details sometimes change; please check with your reservations agent, your front desk cast members, or Guest Relations cast members if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n\nTheme parks\nThe four theme parks are Walt Disney World's bread and butter. These are not traditional amusement parks, where age is a hindrance to full enjoyment. The Disney parks have rides, sure, but many of them are quite sedate and can be enjoyed by everyone, not just those with a high tolerance for thrills. And even beyond the rides, there are stage shows to watch, shops to browse, characters to meet, and atmosphere to soak in.\nMost importantly, though, none of these rides, shows, and stores just \"sits there\". Each one tells a story, in much the same way that Disney's animated films do, and each is crafted with the utmost care and attention to detail. There are also the bigger stories to be found in each themed land, and in the park as a whole. When you enter the Magic Kingdom, and the entrance tunnels give way to the vista of Main Street, with Cinderella Castle at the far end, you're raising the curtain on a new production\u2014and you're the featured player.\nYou won't find dirt or peeling paint or run-down mechanics at a Disney Park, not even at the oldest attractions. Disney takes quality very seriously, and if anything intrudes on your perception of the \"show\", it gets fixed quickly. It's all about suspension of disbelief: total immersion into worlds of imagination, art, and history.\nThe sheer number of attractions\u2014including rides, stage shows, parades, and fireworks displays\u2014at Walt Disney World's four theme parks can be intimidating to guests. It's usually best to have a plan going in. Check the guide map for the park you plan to visit and decide which attractions will be your highest priorities before you leave for the park. Keep in mind that parades and some shows occur only at specific times, and plan your route to put you nearby in time to get a seat. Be flexible, though\u2014once you've hit your priority attractions, you can go back and pick up more if you have time remaining.\nThe traditional amusement park advice of arriving early and heading to the back of the park first tends to work well, although more and more guests are starting to catch on, so the benefit may be reduced.\n\n\nThe Magic Kingdom\nThe Magic Kingdom, based on the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California, is the most popular theme park in the world. It is organized around the central landmark of Cinderella Castle, with various \"lands\" arrayed around a central hub: Main Street USA, Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.\nThe park is the oldest, most crowded, and the most child-friendly, although many adults love it as well. Adult visitors who do not enjoy rides such as it's a small world, where you sit in vehicles that take you in a circle through a tunnel as animatronic figures sing children's songs to the riders, may want to visit Epcot or Hollywood Studios instead. On the other hand, roller coasters like Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad provide plenty of thrills, and dark rides like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean are classics that only the most curmudgeonly would dismiss.\nThe lines at the Magic Kingdom can be endless, but they always keep moving. Though the FastPass system works well, it is not available for all attractions. Even just walking around, you will likely encounter bottlenecks where there are huge masses of people, and they all seem to be going to the same place you are. Then there's the food and the merchandise, which can be pricey, but not too bad considering where you are. Despite it all, most people would agree that the lines, the crowds, and the prices are worth it for the experience.\n\n\nEpcot\n\nEpcot is like an eternal world's fair. It is divided into two distinct areas, Future World and World Showcase. Future World features eight indoor pavilions, each one focused on a specific area of human achievement or endeavor. World Showcase replicates, on a small scale but with great attention to detail, eleven of the world's nations, complete with authentic food and merchandise.\nFirst-time visitors should be sure to ride Spaceship Earth, the park's signature attraction, inside the giant geodesic dome that is Epcot's icon. At the other end of the park, The American Adventure is a stirringly patriotic tribute to the United States. While sedate rides and shows like these used to be Epcot's focus, there are now some very popular thrill rides in Future World. Test Track in which visitors go through the motions of tests for new cars, is probably the most fun, and the most traditionally theme-park-y, of the Epcot rides. Other perennial favorites include Soarin', a ride where visitors \"hang-glide\" through many landscapes, and Mission: SPACE, a centrifugal spaceflight simulator. The newest and very popular ride is Frozen Ever After in the Norway pavilion.\nEpcot has a bit of a reputation as a more \"grown-up\" (or more educational) park. While some of the slower, more intellectual attractions may be over the heads of the youngest visitors, the park still has plenty to keep them entertained. Of course there are character greetings, especially at World Showcase, but there are also Kidcot Fun Stops, which encourage children to work on a craft and interact with cast members who are representing their home countries. The Seas with Nemo & Friends is great fun for fans of Finding Nemo, too.\n\n\nDisney's Hollywood Studios\nDisney's Hollywood Studios (formerly Disney-MGM Studios) is themed around film and television, and features a variety of live shows and attractions based on some of the most iconic productions in Hollywood history. Disney subsidiaries Pixar, Lucasfilm, and The Muppets each have a significant presence here.\nAmong the attractions are a few exceptional thrill rides, most notably The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror (which drops you 13 stories) and the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith (which launches you 0\u201360 in 2.8 seconds). The 3-D shooting gallery Toy Story Mania! and the associated Toy Story Land also grab big crowds, as does the Star Wars-based simulator ride Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.\n\n\nDisney's Animal Kingdom\nDisney's Animal Kingdom, a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, is a wildlife discovery park, a mix between a zoo and a theme park. Naturalistic animal exhibitions are interspersed, and sometimes integrated, with typical Disney rides. Among these are Kilimanjaro Safaris, a jeep safari past live animal enclosures; Kali River Rapids, a raft ride through the deforestation of a tropical rainforest; Dinosaur, a time travel ride which includes close encounters with dinosaurs; and Expedition Everest, a roller coaster that includes an encounter with the Yeti. The newest area of the park, Pandora, is based upon the Avatar movie franchise, featuring other-worldly landscapes and attractions which allow guests to experience scenes from the movie.\nThe park is organized in a Magic Kingdom-like format, with different continents revolving around the central Tree of Life. While light on rides, there are also shows and plenty of animals to view (though the variety of species seems a bit sparse when compared to many larger city zoos). Animal Kingdom is more of a kid-friendly theme park, with many animals that would attract the attention of younger generations, and lots of character greeting opportunities.\n\n\nMeet the characters\n\nEspecially for kids, character greetings are one of the most exciting reasons to visit Disney World. Kids and adults alike can give hugs to, take a photo with, or get autographs from many of their favorite Disney characters. Some kids like to bring or purchase a special autograph book in which the characters can inscribe their names.\nCharacter appearances tend to be surprises (to avoid huge lines), so keep a close eye out. If there's a character your child really wants to see, you can ask at Guest Relations if they know of any upcoming appearances, but nothing is ever guaranteed. And remember that it's hot inside those character costumes; sometimes the character has to leave even if there are people still waiting to say hello. It's disappointing but necessary for safety.\nMost often, character greetings will happen in the parks, in particular the Magic Kingdom, but they can happen just about anywhere! The Magic Kingdom does have the widest variety of characters, though; everyone from Mickey Mouse to Captain Jack Sparrow. Disney's \"Big Six\" (Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and Pluto) might be found anywhere in the park\u2014for example, you might see Donald Duck in a Davy Crockett-like outfit in Frontierland. Other characters stick to the themed land most appropriate for their genre: Jack Sparrow in Adventureland, Buzz Lightyear in Tomorrowland, and so on.\nAt the other parks, character appearances are somewhat rarer. At Epcot, for instance, you'll generally only find characters who hail from one of the themed foreign lands of World Showcase\u2014Mulan in the China pavilion, for example. Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom tend to have more structured greetings, where characters will make scheduled appearances at designated locations, but stay out of sight of most of the park.\nIf you miss out on random encounters with the characters, be sure to look into character dining options. While restaurants that offer character dining are extremely popular, if you can get a table, you're virtually guaranteed a few minutes of face time with the characters. See Character Dining in the Eat section, below.\n\n\nPin trading\nThe trading of commemorative pins has been popular at Olympic Games for decades. At the turn of the millennium, Disney decided to get in on the act and began creating metallic lapel pins specifically for trading. Its popularity peaked about ten years later, but there remains a low level of activity around the parks. Although it's not the massive phenomenon it once was (in part as collectors diversify, first to Vinylmation figures and then to Tsum Tsum plushies), Disney continues to produce scores of new pin designs every year.\nGetting started is easy. Most every store has pins for sale ($7\u2013$14 each), along with lanyards on which to display them. You can also get a starter pack with pins and a lanyard for $20\u2013$60. These pins are generally not very valuable, so you'll need to trade up to get the more interesting (and much rarer) pins. The most reliable way to do so is to keep an eye out for Cast Members wearing pin lanyards. Cast Members are required to trade one-for-one if asked (up to two per guest per day) and can't refuse a trade based on pin rarity or design (although they can refuse to accept another copy of a pin they already have displayed). Cast Members with green lanyards will trade only to kids under 13.\nYou can also trade with your fellow guests, and here things can get interesting. You may need to offer several more common pins to get your hands on a single rare pin. Dedicated traders carry a supply of common pins for just this purpose. Your best way to find people willing to trade is to head to a dedicated pin kiosk or store, but there are also ample opportunities for trading while waiting in lines or while riding the monorail or bus.\nSome tours and special events have unique pins that can only be obtained by participants. These pins are thus very rare and highly coveted. Make sure you (and especially your kids) don't trade these pins away without getting something really nice in return\u2014but even then, think very carefully. Many people treat these more as souvenirs than commodities.\nThere's an annual pin-trading event at Epcot in late August\n\n\nTours\nEach of the theme parks offers at least one tour, some of which are very popular. For an extra fee, a cast member will take you and a small group and introduce you to some of the \"secrets\" behind Disney operations. Many of these tours go into backstage areas where guests are not normally allowed, although children may be restricted from these to avoid spoiling the \"magic\".\nThe gold standard among the tours is the Keys to the Kingdom tour at the Magic Kingdom, a five-hour tour that includes a peek into the park's Utilidors. At Epcot, there are several tours at The Seas with Nemo & Friends that take you into the huge aquarium to get up close to the animals who live there. The newest tour offering is the Wild Africa Trek at Animal Kingdom, which will let you go on-foot into some remote areas of the park's African savanna and forest.\n\n\nWater parks\nWalt Disney World's two water parks, Blizzard Beach near Animal Kingdom and Typhoon Lagoon near Disney Springs, are the most-visited water parks in the country, with a combined total yearly attendance of over 4 million. Each water park has a unique central theme. Blizzard Beach brings to life the absurdity of what would happen if a ski resort suddenly melted, while Typhoon Lagoon makes use of the runoff from a tropical storm for sliding and floating fun.\nBoth parks are big enough to spend several hours sliding, floating, or just soaking up the sun. Counter-service restaurants provide for a hearty lunch. If you have an extra $250 to spend, consider renting a private cabana for the day; they come with towels, lockers, a cabana attendant, and all the bottled water you can drink.\n\n\nShopping, dining, and nightlife\n\nSometimes you just want to get away from the theme parks for a while. Maybe do some shopping, have a quiet meal, or get away from the kids and go out dancing.\nDisney Springs is just what the doctor ordered: an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment paradise, geared primarily toward adults. Most of the entertainment activities are found on the West Side; the featured attraction is Cirque du Soleil,. A new show is expected to debut within the next few years. The middle sections, known as The Landing and Town Center, both have a wide variety of upscale restaurants and fashionable stores, as well as a few quick service options. The east side, known as the Marketplace, is made up largely of gift shops and family restaurants.\nDisney's BoardWalk, next to Epcot, is a smaller collection of nightlife themed as a 1920s Eastern Seaboard boardwalk. The BoardWalk is also home to carnival midway games, tandem bike rentals, the ESPN Club, a dance hall, a dueling piano bar, and more.\n\n\nSporting activities\nOften overlooked during a Walt Disney World vacation\u2014whether due to time constraints or just lack of knowledge\u2014are several recreational activities that have nothing to do with theme parks and rides.\n\n\nGolf\nWalt Disney World is home to three 18-hole championship golf courses, plus a nine-hole walking course and two different miniature golf experiences.\nThe Lake Buena Vista is in the Disney Springs area; it's the most scenic of the courses. The Magnolia and Palm courses, which hosted a popular PGA tournament from 1971\u20132012, are in the Magic Kingdom area, adjacent to the Shades of Green resort. The three championship courses require standard golf attire, and metal cleats are not allowed. Golf clubs are available for rent. A golf cart must be used, but it is included in your greens fee.\nThe Oak Trail Golf Course, in the Magic Kingdom area next to the Magnolia and Palm courses, is a nine-hole walking course. It's designed for less-experienced golfers and older children. The same rules and regulations apply here as at the championship courses, except golf carts are prohibited.\nThe four golf courses can be reached only via car or, in some cases, walking. The Disney-owned resorts offer complimentary taxi vouchers for their guests traveling to the golf courses. For more information or assistance, or to reserve a tee time, call +1 407 WDW-GOLF (939-4653). Tee times can be reserved up to 90 days in advance if you're staying at a Disney hotel (up to 60 days in advance otherwise).\nThe Four Seasons Orlando resort east of Fort Wilderness incorporates what used to be Disney's Osprey Ridge Golf Course; it's open to the public, but different prices and policies will apply.\nThe miniature golf courses are Fantasia Gardens, across the street from the Walt Disney World Swan Hotel in the Epcot resort area, and Winter Summerland, right next to Blizzard Beach. Each has two 18-hole layouts, with whimsical, kid-friendly holes and decor.\n\n\nWatersports\nWalt Disney World boasts a number of expansive waterways, and that means boating, fishing, and other watersports can be a great way to spend a few hours away from the parks.\nThe Magic Kingdom-area resorts each have a small marina with a selection of recreational boats for rent. These include small SeaRaycers, pontoon boats, and speedboats. Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground also offers kayak and canoe rentals.\nAt the Yacht Club Resort (adjacent to the Boardwalk), Bayside Marina offers SeaRaycers, pontoon boats, and a variety of chartered cruises, including an IllumiNations fireworks cruise to Epcot. The Boathouse restaurant at Disney Springs also has a small marina with 'Amphicars' and other guided cruises.\nIf you want something to do while out on a boat (or even on the shore), there are a number of catch-and-release fishing opportunities on the property. Aside from fishing excursions, you can fish from the shore at Ol' Man Island, part of the Port Orleans \u2013 Riverside Resort near Disney Springs.\n\nCall +1-407-WDW-PLAY (939-7529) for recreation information, or +1-407-WDW-BASS (939-2277) for fishing excursions.\n\n\nSpectator sports\nIf spectator sports are more your speed, you may want to check out the ESPN Wide World of Sports, a state-of-the-art sports complex near Hollywood Studios. It features a baseball stadium, two indoor arenas, various sports fields, an athletics complex and a tennis complex. Its biggest events are in late winter/early spring, with the Pro Soccer Classic (the spring training event for Major League Soccer) in February, and baseball spring training for the Atlanta Braves in March. There are a wide variety of other events all year, especially high school and collegiate-level sports.\n\n\nSpas and health clubs\nIf you feel the need for a bit of pampering, Walt Disney World's spa facilities offer a full array of massage, skin, and nail treatments.\nSenses \u2013 A Disney Spa has two locations at Walt Disney World. The spa at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort, near Disney Springs, recalls the heyday of Saratoga Springs, New York, with its healing mineral baths. The spa and health club at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort, near the Magic Kingdom, evokes the Victorian era. There's no significant price difference between the two spas, although some specific treatments are unique to one or the other.\nMandara Spa has a facility at the Walt Disney World Dolphin near Epcot, and there's also the Buena Vista Palace Hotel & Spa at the Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza.\nIf you don't need a full-service spa, most of the other Deluxe resorts have smaller salons with more limited selections of services. These can be a great way to get in some quick relaxation time without having to travel to a different hotel. Most resorts also have at least a modest exercise room, in case you don't do enough walking around at the parks.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\"I like to dive around in my money like a porpoise! And burrow through it like a gopher! And toss it up and let it hit me on the head!\" \u2014 Scrooge McDuck\n\nFinding souvenirs is one of the easiest things to do at Walt Disney World; avoiding the expense is considerably harder. Many attractions, especially the most popular ones, route their exit queues directly into a merchandise store, usually one themed to the attraction. (In fact, several rides even take your picture, which will be available for purchase in the shop.) On the bright side, this does make it easier to find merchandise with a particular theme. Disney's Hollywood Studios is a particularly rich source of themed merchandise, especially for fans of Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and the Muppets.\nSometimes overlooked by shoppers are the various resorts. All of the resorts have a gift shop of some sort, but many go further. For example, Zawadi Marketplace at the Animal Kingdom Lodge has unique African merchandise not available elsewhere, and Wilderness Lodge Mercantile is a great place for forest-lovers and fans of rustic humor. At the BoardWalk resort, look for Wyland Galleries, with underwater-themed prints and paintings, featuring the work of the artist Wyland. In fact, each of the resorts has something a little different that you won't find elsewhere on the property, and it can be fun to look for those little hidden gems.\nRealizing that many of its souvenirs such as the giant Mickey dolls simply aren't made to be lugged around a theme park all day, Disney will save the day with its package pickup and package delivery services, available at all Disney-run stores. Guests staying at an on-site resort hotel can have their purchases delivered to their hotel gift shop, while all guests can have their purchases held at the Package Pick-Up window at the front gate of each theme park. Both services are free of charge, but be sure to factor in delivery times\u2014allow 24 hours for a package to be delivered to your hotel, or about three hours for it to reach the front gate of the park.\nGuests who like the My Disney Experience app on their Android or Apple smartphones might also get use out of the free Shop Disney Parks app. The app lets you find just about any Disney merchandise sold in the parks. The shop you're in doesn't have your size? Not sure where to find that must-have collectible? Search for it in the app and you can find out what stores have it in stock, or purchase it right from the app. You can ship it to your home, just like any other online shopping app, but you have other options, too: if you're in the same park as your item, you can use Disney's package pickup or package delivery service, without ever visiting a checkout register.\nIf you're stuck at home and dying to get some merchandise from the parks, you're in luck. You can use the Shop Disney Parks app on your phone (just as if you were in the parks), or contact Walt Disney World Mail Order.\n\n Walt Disney World Mail Order, \u260f +1 407 363-6200, fax: +1 407 352-6369, wdw.mail.order@disneyworld.com. M-F 9AM-8PM. Shop Walt Disney World from home! Simply call, fax, or e-mail with a detailed description of an item known to be sold anywhere at Walt Disney World, and they'll look it up and ship it to you for the normal retail price plus shipping. \n\n\nMade with Magic\nFor a special souvenir that puts you into the show, check out some Made with Magic merchandise. These special products light up with many different colors, but the real magic occurs when you're watching a nighttime show like Happily Ever After or IllumiNations. At these shows, all of the Made with Magic gear worn by members of the audience will glow and change color in concert with the show effects. It sounds cheesy, but the effects are well coordinated and it really makes you feel like part of the show.\nThe concept started a few years ago with Glow with the Show Mickey ears, but the line has now expanded to include a Minnie headband, a Mickey glove, and a magic wand. Each item costs $25, and they're available at most general merchandise locations throughout the property.\n\n\nEat\n\n\"Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\" \u2014 Mickey Mouse, from The Karnival Kid (1929)\nLike everything else, food is expensive at Walt Disney World. Fortunately, the food is pretty good, top to bottom.\nAt the bottom you'll find portable food carts and fast counter-service (or \"quick-service\" in Disney's parlance) options. Once upon a time, these options were dismal; each counter service location served the same bland menu of burgers and chicken fingers, to the point where even the kids were sick of them by the end of your vacation. Happily, this has all changed in the last 15 years or so.\nThe small stands usually sell pre-packaged treats and snacks. The counter-service restaurants are on par with most chain fast-food joints in quality, but significantly more expensive in price. Still, it's not your typical amusement park fare; some of them are in fact quite good, and there's a lot of variety to be had. Three excellent options are Cosmic Ray's Starlight Cafe (once the world's second busiest restaurant) in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom, the Seasons Food Court at The Land pavilion in Epcot, Flame Tree Barbecue on Discovery Island at Animal Kingdom, and the ABC Commissary at Hollywood Studios, which has a surprisingly international menu.\nFor the lowest possible prices, there is one McDonald's restaurant on WDW property, at the intersection of Buena Vista Drive and Osceola Parkway, between Blizzard Beach and the All-Star resort hotels.\nMoving up the scale, there is a fairly big gap between the counter-service and the lower-end table-service restaurants. If anything can be said to fill that gap, it's the buffets, but there are not many around, and most of them feature walk-around characters. For table service, you'll find the menus tend to be surprisingly limited; although the food is generally good, if your party has a lot of picky eaters you may have trouble finding a restaurant everyone can agree on. (Fortunately, Disney is very accommodating of special requests, so don't be afraid to ask for the demi-glace to be left off or to substitute fries for the au-gratin potatoes.)\nAt the high-end of Disney dining, you'll find some options on par with the best in the country, including perhaps the fanciest restaurant in all of Central Florida, Victoria and Albert's. The Micehlin-starred Victorian era themed retaurant at the Grand Floridian. These high-end restaurants do tend to be found at the resorts; few people want to go out to a fancy dinner after walking around the parks all day without changing first. Don't feel like you have to leave the kids behind, either; every restaurant on property (except Victoria and Albert's, which only welcomes kids over 10) welcomes kids and will serve them in the best Disney tradition.\nFor those with dietary restrictions such as allergies, Disney restaurants won't leave you guessing. In 2015, they rolled out new allergy-friendly menus at every restaurant; simply ask for one and you can see which menu items contain gluten, dairy, peanut, tree nut, and fish ingredients. If you're at a table-service or buffet restaurant and need more information, a chef will personally help you select from the available options and offer alternatives for your specific need. Be sure to make a note of your restrictions when making your ADRs (Advance Dining Reservations, see the section below); many common restrictions are available as checkboxes in the online form. If your needs are more complex, or your restriction isn't listed, go ahead and make your ADRs, and then contact Walt Disney World Special Diets (SpecialDiets@DisneyWorld.com, \u260f +1 407-824-5967) at least 14 days before your trip; they'll get everything squared away and make sure the restaurants are notified of your needs.\nIf a dietary restriction requires you to bring your own food into the parks, it is permissible to do so, on the condition that it does not require heating or any other kind of preparation. To ensure freshness, carry it in an insulated lunch box or bag. Keep in mind, though, that Florida Department of Health regulations prohibit Disney's Culinary Cast Members from preparing, or even handling, foods brought in by guests. Also, Disney prohibits bringing in loose ice.\nIf you're interested in making sure your kids (or your spouse) get healthy meals and snacks, keep an eye out for the Mickey Check logo, introduced in 2012 and prominently displayed next to the healthiest options on menus and snack stands. Items with the Mickey Check meet Disney's new nutrition guidelines, which are aligned with U.S. federal guidelines.\n\n\nPrices\nWalt Disney World uses a four-part \"dollar sign\" dining price classification system:\n\n$: $14.99 and under\n$$: $15 \u2013 $29.99\n$$$: $30 \u2013 $75.99\n$$$$: $76+\nMost counter service restaurants have $ ratings, and most table service restaurants are either $$ or $$$. \"Signature\" restaurants are usually $$$. Victoria and Albert's is the only restaurant with a $$$$ rating.\n\n\nCharacter dining\nOne of the unique attractions of dining at Walt Disney World is the opportunity to interact up-close with favorite characters during Disney's character dining meals. These opportunities are extremely popular; for all practical purposes, advance reservations are required. In exchange for planning ahead, though, you will get to meet and take pictures with the characters, making for a memorable experience.\nThe range of characters to be found is enormous. Mickey and Minnie and the gang are the most common of course, at places like Chef Mickey's in the Contemporary Resort, but you might also find Mary Poppins at 1900 Park Fare at the Grand Floridian, or characters from Disney Junior at Hollywood & Vine in Hollywood Studios. And of course the (fairy) godmother of them all is Cinderella's Royal Table, inside the castle in the Magic Kingdom, where little girls can indulge their princess fantasies to their hearts' content, so long as their parents can actually get reservations.\n\n\nDisney Dining Plan\n(As of September 2022, the Disney Dining Plan is unavailable. In June 2021, Walt Disney Company executives announced that the plan would return, but offered no details. There have been no updates since. For the time being, this section will likely give an idea of what may return eventually, but continue to monitor news from the Walt Disney Company to see what the future holds)\nGuests purchasing a Disney vacation package with hotel stay are eligible to participate in the Disney Dining Plan. For a flat additional fee, the plan allows guests a set number of meals per person per night of their stay. The Disney Dining Plan is accepted at any Disney-run restaurant on the property except Victoria and Albert's. In addition, all of the restaurants at Disney Springs, even those run by outside companies, also accept the Dining Plan.\nThe Dining Plan is available at three different levels (prices are approximate):\n\nMagic Your Way package plus Quick-Service Dining\nTwo quick-service meals and two snacks per person per night. Cost: $48/night for adults and juniors, $21/night for children 3\u20139\nMagic Your Way package plus Dining\nOne table-service meal, one quick-service meal, and one snack per person per night. Cost: $69/night for adults and juniors, $25/night for children 3\u20139\nMagic Your Way package plus Deluxe Dining\nThree meals (table- or quick-service) and two snacks per person per night. Cost: $107/night for adults and juniors, $39/night for children 3\u20139\nThe Magic Your Way Premium and Platinum packages also include Deluxe Dining. A \"snack\" as part of the dining plan is a single prepackaged item, side dish, soup, piece of fruit, or non-alcoholic beverage at any counter-service, snack cart, or merchandise location. You can use a quick-service meal credit to get up to three snack items.\nAll dining plans also include a resort refillable drink mug, one per person. This plastic mug can be refilled at the quick service location at a guest's resort for their entire length of stay. It cannot be refilled in the parks, but during the hot summer months, you can fill it with water from the many water fountains.\nSome \"signature\" restaurants, plus the dinner shows, require two table-service credits for one meal. These restaurants are Artist's Point, California Grill, Le Cellier, Cinderella's Royal Table, Citricos, Flying Fish, the Hollywood Brown Derby, Jiko \u2013 The Cooking Place, Monsieur Paul, Narcoossee's, Tiffins, Wolfgang Puck's The Dining Room, and Yachtsman Steakhouse, plus the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue, Mickey's Backyard BBQ, and Disney's Spirit of Aloha dinner shows. Room service, where available, also takes two table-service credits, except for pizza delivery.\nTo use the Dining Plan, simply use your MagicBand. Gratuities are not included, but you can charge the tip to your room account with your MagicBand.\nFrequent visitors to Walt Disney World are split on the value of the Dining Plans. The general consensus is that it is worth it only if you're certain you'll use every last credit in the plan, and that requires planning ahead and (if you have table-service credits) diligent use of reservations. If you want more flexibility in how you take your meals, just going with whatever sounds or looks good, you'll be better off paying for each meal individually. Of course, if you take advantage of one of Disney's frequent promotions that offer a free dining plan with your hotel reservation, then by all means enjoy it, and make sure to hit up restaurants you wouldn't otherwise get to try.\n\n\nAdvance Dining Reservations\n\"Ma ch\u00e8re mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair, as the dining room proudly presents... your dinner.\" \u2014 Lumiere, from Beauty and the Beast (1991)\nWalt Disney World restaurants do not take reservations, per se. Disney's system for its table-service restaurants is called Advance Dining Reservations (ADRs). An ADR is sort of like a restaurant FastPass. Essentially, when you make an ADR, you are reserving a spot on the restaurant's waiting list. When you arrive at the restaurant at your reserved time, you will immediately be placed at the top of the waiting list and get the next available table suitable for your party.\nThe importance of ADRs cannot be understated. During the slowest times of the year, you may find you don't have any problem walking up to a restaurant and getting a seat within 15-30 minutes. If you don't particularly care where you eat, or are willing to eat early or late, you can probably get by without ADRs. But if you have your heart set on a particular restaurant, or you want to make sure you can eat right at noon or 6PM, you'll want an ADR. And if it's peak season, better safe than sorry; without an ADR you may find yourself searching high and low for a table even at 8PM.\nOf course, you can also get by without ADRs if you decide to only eat at counter-service restaurants (which don't take reservations at all).\nA few restaurants are so popular that they regularly fill up even during the slowest periods. ADRs are essential for these. The one that takes the cake is Cinderella's Royal Table, inside the castle in the Magic Kingdom, which is usually booked solid within minutes of reservations opening. Le Cellier in the Canada pavilion at Epcot has a reputation as the best steakhouse on the property and so is very popular. Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian also strongly suggests ADRs so that you can get a menu customized to your tastes. ADRs are also a good idea for any of the dinner shows, and any meal featuring the Disney characters.\nTo make Advance Dining Reservations, do not try to call the restaurants directly. Call Disney Dining at +1 407 WDW-DINE (daily 7AM-10PM ET) to make all of your reservations. ADRs are accepted up to 180 days in advance of the date of the reservation. If you want to get in to any of the restaurants mentioned above, especially Cinderella's Royal Table, start dialing at 6:55 on the first day you can make the reservation, and keep hitting redial until you stop getting told they're closed.\nAlternatively, you can book ADRs online. Go to Disney's restaurants page, find the restaurant you want to eat at, and see if it has an orange \"Book a Reservation\" button. Many people continue to stick with the tried-and-true phone call, though, because the operators can quickly suggest and check for alternatives if your first choices aren't available.\nNote that guests staying at a Disney-owned hotel are allowed to make ADRs for their entire trip on the 180th day before they arrive. That means you can make an ADR for the seventh day of your trip 186 days in advance; this is a big perk of staying at a Disney hotel.\nIf you're already on your vacation, you can visit Guest Relations at any park or Disney Springs, or even your hotel concierge, to book your ADRs. Restaurants frequently get cancellations, so don't be afraid to ask if that popular restaurant you've had your eye on has an opening tomorrow, especially if you're willing to eat early or late.\nWhen booking an ADR, you must provide a valid credit card number; this card will be charged $10 if you don't show up for your reservation. You can avoid this fee by canceling before the day of your reservation\u2014but like Cinderella, you only have until midnight. If you need to cancel an ADR, use the special cancellations line, +1 407-WDW-CNCL (939-2625); you will likely have a shorter wait time than on the main dining number.\n\n\nIn-park dining\nFood is easier than easy to find in all four theme parks. In-park dining opportunities range from snack carts to the most common fast-food joints to the less common table service restaurants. Bear in mind that the hours between noon and 2PM are generally considered the \"peak\" dining time in the parks. If you find yourself eating lunch within this time frame, expect to wait 30 minutes to an hour in line before being served, unless you have a reservation at a table service restaurant. As an alternative, some snack carts serve fairly large portions (such as smoked turkey legs in the Magic Kingdom's Frontierland), and have short lines most of the time.\nEvery park has low-cost meals in the $4\u2013$5 range for kid meals and $7\u2013$10 for adult meals at the sandwich shops, ethnic specialty nooks, cafeterias, and communal dining halls. They provide ample food for the money, and the quality is usually pretty decent. You can often feed your whole family for little more than the cost of one expensive main course at any of the upscale restaurants.\n\n\nResort dining\nAll of the Disney Resorts have at least one restaurant, ranging from food courts and buffets all the way up to award-winning table-service restaurants. The Value resorts only have simple food courts, but the dining options expand as you go up the price scale. Best of all, some of the hotel restaurants have Disney character greetings.\nMost people, when visiting other hotels, make reservations at the resorts' buffets and sit-down restaurants. However, what they don't always realize is that some of the hotels' most delicious and unique foods can be found in their food courts and smaller dining areas\u2014and they're cheap, too. Check out some of these hidden gems:\n\nBoardwalk To Go, Boardwalk Inn. BTG serves many quick foods like corn dogs and chicken sandwiches, but one of its tastiest items is the cheese and/or chili fries. You can get a basket of cheese fries for $4.00. The chili fries are also $4.00. Chili and cheese fries are $4.50. It makes for a great afternoon or evening snack.\nCaptain Cook's, Polynesian Village Resort. One of the Polynesian's specialties is Tonga Toast\u2014a deep fried and battered breakfast dish made from sourdough bread, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, and stuffed with bananas. It's available at the Kona Caf\u00e9 for $10.99, served with strawberry compote and your choice of ham, bacon, or sausage. However, for those of you on a budget, you can also get Tonga Toast at Captain Cook's food court for only $5.09. If that's not to your liking, try the adult breakfast platter for just $6.29, which has more than enough food to share with others.\nMara, Animal Kingdom Lodge. One of the resort's most unique and popular desserts is the Zebra Domes. They are a layer of yellow cake topped with mocha-chocolate mouse, covered in white chocolate ganache and painted over with milk chocolate ganache stripes to resemble a zebra. They are originally made and served in Boma, the resort's buffet restaurant. However, guests on the go can buy a four-pack at Mara for $3.69 during lunch and dinner.\nMarket Street Food Court, Caribbean Beach Resort. One of this food court's specialties is the rotisserie chicken in the Bridgetown Broiler section. It's only served at dinner and comes with your choice of two sides.\nRoaring Fork, Wilderness Lodge. Don't miss this food court's brownies. Each $3.29 brownie is frosted and cut in squares roughly four inches wide and half an inch thick, making them well worth the price. They're quite hefty, so be careful when picking one up. You might need to use both hands!\nSassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory, Port Orleans-French Quarter. One of the specialty foods here are the beignets, medium-sized fried French donuts covered in powdered sugar. They are part of the New Orleans culture and exclusively served at the Port Orleans Resort. You can buy three beignets for $2.99 or six for $4.29. They're tasty, but watch out for the sugar. It can get everywhere!\n\n\nDrink\n\"Walt sent me.\" \u2014 Eddie Valiant, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\nOnce upon a time, Pleasure Island was a hot and happening nightspot, right on Disney property\u2014and after a certain hour you knew there'd be no kids around. Today, Pleasure Island's nightclubs are but a memory, but that doesn't mean adults can't have some grown-up fun after dark.\nCertainly Disney Springs, where Pleasure Island used to be, is still a vibrant and active place at night. Several of the restaurants there, especially at The Landing and on the West Side, have full-service bars; Raglan Road in particular is really more an Irish pub than a restaurant. And the DJ at Bongos Cuban Cafe will keep you dancing throughout the evening.\nDespite the closure of Pleasure Island, don't think Walt Disney World is completely devoid of nightclubs these days. If you take a trip over to Disney's BoardWalk, you'll find a modern dance club called Atlantic Dance Hall, a dueling-pianos bar called Jellyrolls, and a quiet but magical lounge called AbracadaBAR. The rest of the BoardWalk also stays brightly lit until late at night, with sidewalk cafes, strolling magicians, and other quaint beach-style nightlife.\nMost of the resort hotels have their own lounges as well. While they're not exactly a good place to dance the night away, they do offer a more intimate, relaxed atmosphere and plenty of adult beverages. And if you just want to have a drink with dinner, most of the restaurants on property offer at least a few alcoholic options.\nIn Epcot, a popular stunt is called Drinking Around the World: have a drink in each of the countries of World Showcase. (Or, for a fun, free, and sober trip \"around the world\", try a variety of international Coca-Cola products at Club Cool in the Innoventions pavilion.)\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing alcohol at WDW:\nThe drinking age for alcohol in Walt Disney World (and all of Florida, for that matter) is 21. Be prepared for strict enforcement of this rule; anybody caught drinking underage, even with parents, may be subject to ejection from the property and criminal prosecution.\nBe sure to bring an actual I.D. with you when purchasing beverages. Copies will not suffice.\nNo alcoholic beverages may be brought in to any of the theme parks.\nAlcoholic beverages may not be consumed outside of, or even removed from, their designated places of purchase (i.e., alcohol purchased in Disney's Hollywood Studios cannot leave the park). Alcohol purchased at selected gift shops (such as Weinkeller in Epcot's Germany pavilion in World Showcase) will be sealed in a gift box; if the box is opened, the purchase cannot be carried out of the park. As an alternative, the shop will have the package delivered to the front gate or to your on-site resort hotel free of charge, or you can arrange for shipping back home for a fee.\nThe coffee at Walt Disney World has been a hit-or-miss affair. For years, the choices were generally instant (Nescaf\u00e9) or nothing. Over the years, however, brewed coffee of varying quality has been popping up at the parks and resorts, with devotees sometimes going out of their way to get to the \"real stuff\". Kona Cafe at the Polynesian Village Resort has been one of the most popular destinations, featuring as it does real Hawaiian Kona coffee. Starbucks aficionados can also take heart: Disney has entered into a partnership with the coffee giant to establish full-menu Starbucks outlets in each of its parks.\n\n\nSleep\n\nOne of the most important choices you must make when planning a Walt Disney World vacation is whether to stay on-site at one of the famed Disney resorts, or off-site at one of countless less expensive but more traditional hotels.\nFor many visitors, a vital part of the Walt Disney World \"experience\" is staying at one of the 25 Disney-owned and -operated resorts. Each and every one of the Disney resorts is strongly themed, impeccably maintained, and a vacation experience all to itself. Although none of the resorts can really be called cheap\u2014in fact, most of them are luxurious and priced accordingly\u2014the least expensive resorts have rooms for as little as $82 a night in the off-season.\n\nThere are a number of perks that are available only to Disney resort hotel guests:\nEarly Theme Park Entry: lets you into the parks 30 minutes before posted opening every day.\nFree and convenient access to the parks via Disney transportation: bus, monorail, or water taxi\nYour hotel is only a quick trip away, allowing you to leave the parks when the crowds (or the sun) get to be too much and take a nap or go for a dip in one of the hotel pools\nYour MagicBand serves as your room key and room-charge account access, in addition to being your park admission media\u2014no wallet needed\nAbility to make advance dining reservations for your entire trip as early as 60 days before you arrive\nDisney Cast Members available to answer your questions\nFree package delivery from Disney-operated retail stores to your hotel\nFree taxi service to the golf courses, if you don't have your own car\nUnique Disney-style resort entertainment and theming\nOn the other hand, staying off-property can have its own perks. Lodging and food costs are indisputably cheaper\u2014often significantly so, with frequent discounts. You can book condos or home rentals for large groups, which allows you to cook meals making dining costs even cheaper and lodging costs very cheap. Many off-site resorts do have shuttle service to the Disney parks, although the service can be limited, potentially inconvenient, and may carry a fee. And you can still buy MagicBands even if you're staying off-site (though you won't be able to use them as your room key, of course).\nIf you're going to stay off-property, there are scores of options, but be sure to research your selection well. Lots of hotels advertise themselves as being close to Walt Disney World, often with the word \"Maingate\" in their names, but they could be several miles away in reality. See Lake Buena Vista and Kissimmee for off-property listings.\nOne possible compromise between the two approaches is to stay at the Walt Disney World Swan, Walt Disney World Dolphin, or Four Seasons Orlando, which offer a more traditional hotel experience with a selection of Disney resort benefits available. Another option is to stay at a hotel in the Disney Springs Resort Plaza; they're fairly generic and have few Disney amenities, but they're just across the street from Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney).\n\n\nDisney resorts\n\nDisney has created an incredible variety of themed resorts over the years, each one offering a unique experience to guests, ranging from the basic services and colorful decor at the three All-Star resorts, to the opulence and luxury of Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, to the rustic, wooded charm of Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground.\nCheck-in time at Disney resorts is 3PM (4PM for the All-Star Resorts), and check-out time is 11AM\u2014but don't fret if your flight schedule doesn't match up. You can do an early check-in starting at 8AM; leave your bags with bell services and they'll be delivered to your room when it's ready. You'll get your MagicBands (if you don't already have them), so you can go enjoy the parks right away. Likewise at check-out; you can get into the parks all day on the day of your departure, so just leave your bags with bell services and pick them up before you leave for the airport.\nIf you opt to get your MagicBands by mail ahead of time, you can check-in online and go directly to your room upon arrival at your resort (except Fort Wilderness), bypassing the front desk entirely.\nPlease see each district's Sleep section for details on individual hotels.\n\n\nBudget\nDisney classifies their cheapest options as Value resorts. These resorts are great for guests with a limited budget, or for families with young kids on whom the sophisticated theming and amenities at the other resorts would be wasted. Prices (one room, two adults and two children) range from $82/night for a standard room in the value season to $160/night for a preferred room during Christmas week. There is a $10 fee for each adult beyond two per room.\nThe Value resorts have basic rooms with exterior entrances and minimal amenities. The theming is bold and colorful\u2014kids love the larger-than-life decorations\u2014but not particularly evocative of any particular environment. Hotel amenities include food courts and swimming pools, but no sit-down restaurants or other on-site recreation options.\nThe Value resorts are All-Star Movies, All-Star Sports, and All-Star Music near Animal Kingdom; and Art of Animation and Pop Century near Hollywood Studios.\nIf you have a tent, camper, or motorhome, perhaps the best value on Disney property is at Fort Wilderness (near the Magic Kingdom), where you can rent a campsite for as little as $43 a night.\n\n\nMid-range\nThese are Disney's Moderate resorts. Guests who want the full Disney resort experience without paying for the extra luxuries and amenities at the Deluxe resorts will be more than satisfied by the Moderate resorts. Prices (one room, two adults and two children) range from $149/night for a standard room in the value season to $250/night for a preferred room during Christmas week. Prices can go even higher for the new pirate-themed rooms at Caribbean Beach and club-level rooms and suites at Coronado Springs. There is a $15 fee for each adult beyond two per room.\nThe Moderate resorts have basic rooms with exterior entrances. The theming is straightforward but fun and evocative of the appropriate time and place, from the Louisiana bayou at Port Orleans-Riverside to the warm Caribbean colors of the Caribbean Beach. Hotel amenities include food courts, sit-down restaurants (usually), limited room service, swimming pools with extras (such as a slide), and some on-site recreation activities.\nThe Moderate resorts are Caribbean Beach near Hollywood Studios; Port Orleans-Riverside and Port Orleans-French Quarter near Disney Springs; and Coronado Springs near Animal Kingdom.\n\n\nSplurge\nDisney's Deluxe resorts and the Deluxe villas fall into this category, the largest by far.\n\n\nDeluxe resorts\nThe Deluxe resorts are for guests who want the ultimate in Disney hospitality, with luxury-hotel amenities and signature Disney experiences. Prices in this category vary widely. Some basic rooms can be had for as little as $240 a night in the value season, but more commonly start at $355/night and go up to $835 or more for the best single rooms. Luxurious suites are available at most of the resorts, starting at over $1,000/night and going up from there. There is a $25 fee for each adult beyond two per room.\nDeluxe resorts feature well-appointed rooms with interior entrances and extensive theming to match the resort. A Deluxe resort's decor is evocative and all-encompassing, with as much attention paid to detail as at any of the Disney theme parks. Hotel amenities include multiple full-service and casual restaurants, often with character dining; full room service; extensive pool and beach facilities with plenty of extras; numerous on-site recreation activities; and valet parking.\nThe Deluxe resorts are the Contemporary, the Wilderness Lodge, the Polynesian Village, and the Grand Floridian near the Magic Kingdom; the Boardwalk Inn, the Yacht Club, and the Beach Club near Epcot, and the Animal Kingdom Lodge near Animal Kingdom.\nThe rental cabins at Fort Wilderness (near the Magic Kingdom) have full kitchens, plumbing, and maid service. They sleep six for $265\u2013$410 a night.\n\n\nDeluxe villas\nThe Deluxe villas were created to be part of the Disney Vacation Club, a time-share program created by Disney, but when DVC members aren't using them, they're open to the general public. The villas offer a more \"home-away-from-home\" feel, with studios and one-, two-, and even three-bedroom suites available. Prices range from $295/night for a studio at Old Key West or Saratoga Springs during the value season to $2,215/night for a three-bedroom Grand Villa at the Boardwalk or Beach Club Villas during Christmas week. If that price seems astonishing, consider that those villas sleep twelve people!\nStudios have a kitchenette; the suites have full kitchens with dishware (and the Grand Villas have full dining rooms). Most of the DVC resorts are attached to one of Disney's Deluxe resorts, sharing amenities with the \"parent\" resort; the others (Old Key West and Saratoga Springs) are standalone but have comparable amenities.\nThe DVC resorts are Bay Lake Tower at the Contemporary, the Villas at the Wilderness Lodge, the Villas at the Grand Floridian, and the Polynesian Villas and Bungalows near the Magic Kingdom; the Boardwalk Villas and Beach Club Villas near Epcot; the Animal Kingdom Villas near Animal Kingdom; and Old Key West and Saratoga Springs near Disney Springs.\n\n\nNon-Disney resorts\nThis section covers only those resorts that are not owned/operated by Disney, but are located on Disney property. Off-property hotels are covered in other articles.\n\n\nBudget\nIf you or a family member is an employee or retiree of the United States Department of Defense, including the military, you're in luck. Shades of Green, near the Magic Kingdom has rooms starting at $93, depending on the employee's pay grade. Amenities are somewhat limited, though; see the full listing for details.\nFor everyone else, affordable deals can be found at the Disney Springs Hotel Plaza located adjacent to the Disney Springs Marketplace, and comprising seven franchise hotels. Disney amenities are virtually nonexistent; only their proximity to Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) separates them from the other hotels in Lake Buena Vista. Their prices are quite reasonable, though, considering their location.\n\n\nSplurge\nThe Walt Disney World Swan and Walt Disney World Dolphin, located near Epcot and not far from Hollywood Studios, have most of the amenities of Disney Resorts but are not operated by Disney. They are ideal for guests who want a more traditional hotel experience while still being right in the middle of Disney property. The whimsical exteriors are a sight to see all by themselves.\nThe Four Seasons Orlando is located east of Fort Wilderness. It incorporates what used to be Disney's Osprey Ridge Golf Course, and boasts views of the Magic Kingdom fireworks from some of its rooms. Aside from its location and some integration with the Disney ecosystem, though, it's a typical luxury hotel.\n\n1 Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, 4401 Floridian Way, Bay Lake, \u260f +1-407-824-3000. Check-in: 3:00PM, check-out: 11:00AM. Stately Victorian resort & spa overlooking the Seven Seas Lagoon. $900. (updated Mar 2021)\n\n\nConnect\nGenerally, visitors enjoy coming to Walt Disney World for a break from daily life, but that doesn't mean you want to be cut off completely. Mail can be dropped off at locations just inside each theme park's gates. Or, to really get into the spirit, drop your postcard in a real vintage mailbox on Main Street U.S.A.; cast members pick up such mail daily. Deluxe hotels might provide copies of the local newspaper, the Orlando Sentinel; ask at the front desk.\nAs of December 2012, and after years of guest grumbling, Internet access at Walt Disney World has been vastly improved. Free Wi-Fi is now available in every park, at every resort, and in each guest room (free wired access at Fort Wilderness campsites). This is expected to help alleviate the many cellular network load issues that have plagued guests at the World. The speed may not be great, but at least you'll be able to check your e-mail... and use Disney's mobile apps!\nBut remember, Walt Disney World is designed to be an immersive environment; you'll miss a lot if your eyes are locked onto a mobile device. Make an effort to keep the electronics usage to a minimum, and just enjoy a respite from the world outside the World.\n\n\nCall\nUseful phone numbers:\n\n General Reservations and Disney's Magical Express, \u260f +1-800-4-DISNEY (347639), +1 407-W-DISNEY (9-347639). \n Walt Disney World Dining, \u260f +1 407-WDW-DINE (939-3463). \n Walt Disney World Recreation:, \u260f +1 407-WDW-PLAY (939-7529). \n Walt Disney World Fairy Tale Weddings, \u260f +1 407-828-3400. \n Walt Disney World College Program, \u260f +1 407-828-2850. \n\n\nStay safe\n\nWalt Disney World is a very safe area, and the company spends a lot of time and money ensuring that it remains so. Still, it's wise to take common-sense precautions; even Disney can't account for every contingency. People have been victimized and injured while visiting Walt Disney World, but there are plenty of steps you can take to minimize the chance of anything happening.\n\n\nSecurity\nSecuirty checkpoint are in place in front of all parks as well as Disney Springs.  If you have a bag, backpack, or stroller a security officer will check its contents before you enter, and guests are required to pass through contactless security scanners. Weapons of all kinds are forbidden, as well as toy firearms (including blasters), though toy swords (including lightsabers) are allowed.\nWhile theft is rare and security is always present throughout the resort, it's still a good idea to keep valuables locked in the electronic safe in your hotel room. Avoid bringing unnecessary items with you, and if you must, rent a locker and store them locked inside during your visit.\nKeep your eye on your belongings at all times. Do not display large amounts of cash. Do not leave anything in an unattended stroller or wheelchair, especially when you go on a ride. If possible, leave loose articles with a non-rider. If you belive you have been a victim of theft, notify any cast member and they will summon security and sheriff's officers.\nChildren are very safe at Walt Disney World, but it's not uncommon for parents and children to get separated due to the crowds. One suggestion is to write down your child's name with your name, resort, cell phone number, and any vital medical information on a 3x5 index card. Place the card in your child's pocket and instruct him/her to show the card to any Cast Member in the event that you get separated. Likewise, if you lose your child, notify a Cast Member immediately. They are all well trained and will get you reunited as quickly as possible. If your child goes on a ride on his/her own, make sure you know where the ride's exit is. Children separated from their families will be brought to the baby care/first aid centre.\nArrange a place to meet with all members of your party if you become separated. Make the meeting place easy to find, but out of the way; areas such as in front of Cinderella Castle or the front of the park are likely to be too crowded to be useful. Some families also wear matching T-shirts with very bright, bold colors, making it less difficult to spot a member of your party in a sea of people.\n\n\nRide safety\nDisney has a standard safety warning that applies to select attractions in each park:\n\nThe above warning applies to the following attractions:\n\nMagic Kingdom\nSpace Mountain, Tomorrowland Speedway, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad\nEpcot\nTest Track, Mission: Space\nHollywood Studios\nStar Tours, Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror\nAnimal Kingdom\nDinosaur, Kilimanjaro Safaris, Expedition Everest, Kali River Rapids, Primeval Whirl\nLap children are not permitted on most rides, especially if there are restraining devices. If your child does not meet the ride's height requirement, there is a \"rider swap\" service available. This service enables one person to wait with the child while another goes on the ride; afterwards the person waiting with the child may board the ride without having to wait in line. Ask a Cast Member for more information.\nYou're not even supposed to have them in the park, but if by some chance you manage to get a camera monopod (aka a selfie stick) past security, never use it while on a ride; the rides' safety margins were not designed to account for the length of your selfie stick.\n\n\nWildlife\nDisney does everything they can to keep the wildlife away from the guests, but there are still some hazards.\n\nAlligators are sometimes spotted in or near bodies of water. While Disney had long downplayed the risks, the death of a two-year-old boy in the park in 2016 has made the danger clear. Never enter the water except in designated swimming areas, especially after dusk.\nYou'll find nuisance insects like mosquitoes to be much less common on Disney property than elsewhere in Florida. Still, if you're concerned or have a special sensitivity, don't rely on Disney's pest control efforts; use bug spray.\n\n\nPet safety\nWith the exception of working service animals, pets are not permitted in the parks, at Disney Springs, or on transportation vehicles. Most resorts also disallow pets. There are designated campsites at Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground that do allow dogs; ask when you make your reservation. As a pilot program, up to two dogs per unit are now allowed at Art of Animation, Yacht Club, Port Orleans Riverside, and the Fort Wilderness cabins; the nightly fee is $50 ($75 at Yacht Club) and dogs must be leashed when outside the room.\nIf you do bring your pooch, or other companion animal, you'll still need to drop her off somewhere when you go to the parks; don't leave her in your room! Best Friends Pet Care operates a \"pet resort\" near the Port Orleans resorts. They offer a variety of packages, including both day stays and overnight accommodations, with separate areas for dogs, cats, and \"pocket pets\" like hamsters.\nDo not leave your pet in your car. It is against the law in Florida, as well as potentially fatal. The penalty is a $5,000 fine. A car with a pet locked inside will be broken into to remove the pet, and WDW will not be held liable for any damages incurred.\nService animals may not be accommodated on some attractions. In that case, they must remain with a non-riding member of your party, as Cast Members are not authorized to handle service animals. And be cognizant of what each attraction is like and whether your service animal is likely to be startled or frightened.\n\n\nAssistance\nIf you have car trouble while in a theme park's parking lot, raise your car's hood, and someone will come to your assistance.\nJust like anywhere else in the USA, the emergency number throughout Walt Disney World is 911. Contacting this number will get you in touch with Reedy Creek Emergency Services, WDW's police, fire, and ambulance service.\nMinor first aid services are available free of charge at any park or resort and offer a quiet and cool place to rest. The stations at the parks have refrigerators available for medicines that need to be kept chilled, and nursing mothers can find both quiet and privacy inside. The first aid locations in each park:\nMagic Kingdom \u2014 next to the Crystal Palace, left around the central hub.\nEpcot \u2014 next to the baby center on the World Showcase side of the Odyssey Center.\nHollywood Studios \u2014 at Guest Relations\nAnimal Kingdom \u2014 in Discovery Island, next to Creature Comforts\nIf an emergency need for prescription drugs occurs, Turner Drugs, +1 407-828-8125 at 1530 Celebration Blvd Suite 105-A will deliver the medication. They also will deliver OTC items and pick-up many items they do not stock and deliver them, as well. Most WDW hotels will pay for the delivery and charge the guest's room. There are also several Walgreens locations nearby.\nThere are two full-service medical facilities just outside the property lines:\n Celebration Health, 400 Celebration Pl., \u260f +1 407-303-4000. Located at the intersection of I-4, US-192, and FL-417. \n CentraCare, 12500 S Apopka Vineland Rd., \u260f +1 407 934-2273. Located adjacent to the Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza. \n\n\nWeather\nEspecially during the spring and summer, heat is the most likely weather-related issue you'll encounter.\n\nTo cope:\nWear a light-colored shirt during the summer. White and light colors reflect sunlight better than darker colors, so you won't get overheated as easily. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your head, face and eyes. Sunscreen may be purchased at most gift shops, but are often sold exorbitantly overpriced, so it may be easier on your wallet to bring your own.\nDrink lots of water. You can easily become dehydrated in the heat. Stay clear of carbonated drinks, tea and coffee. Dehydration can lead to weakness, fatigue, and eventually heat stroke due to the body's reduced ability to regulate its temperature.\nGo back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool to cool you off. Or cool off in the one of the many interactive fountains that can be found in the parks. (Don't forget to take spare clothing with you!) Another good idea would be to visit Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon in the morning, then head to the theme parks afterwards; this will give your body adequate hydration to better withstand the heat.\nGo indoors, into an air-conditioned shop or attraction. Try to do the outdoor attractions in the morning, and save the indoor attractions and shows until the afternoon when it's hotter.\nRemember that even on cool days, the Florida sun can burn. Visitors from northern latitudes often don't realize that the sun's angle in Florida is going to be higher than back home, and that means a greater likelihood of sunburn... even if the temperature is in the 50s or 60s Fahrenheit (10-20 \u00b0C). Wear sunscreen!\nIf your trip is in the late summer or early fall, you'll soon learn about the daily afternoon thundershowers. They are usually brief and won't ruin your whole day. If you want to stay dry, rain ponchos and umbrellas are sold throughout the parks. Walt Disney World does not close down due to rain, though some outdoor rides and attractions may temporarily do so.\nHurricanes are a different story. The Orlando area is as far from the coasts as anyplace in the state, so hurricane-related closures are very rare; as of 2022, the parks have been closed only 9 times due to hurricanes in 50+ years they've been running. If the parks do end up closed for high winds, though, your resort hotel will make sure you stay entertained, sometimes with special appearances from the Disney characters. The hotels are perfectly safe in high winds.\n\n\nRespect\nSure, you're on vacation, but there are still some rules you must follow.\nDisney is relatively accommodating when it comes to bringing items into the parks. As long as you're not toting a full-size cooler packed with soda and cold cuts, you can bring in small amounts of ready-to-eat foods for your family. You can also bring in drinks, as long as they're non-alcoholic and not in glass bottles. Large items, including big strollers, full-size luggage, and bulky camera equipment (including monopods, aka 'selfie sticks') may be turned away at the gate. Weapons and weapon-like toys also aren't permitted, for obvious reasons.\n\nYou also need to pay attention to what you're wearing. Disney requests that guests be wearing \"appropriate attire\" at all times. That means that shirts, shoes, and shorts or pants are required; bikinis (for example) must be covered (standard beachwear is fine at the water parks, of course). Your clothing shouldn't include any objectionable words or pictures, and the same goes for any visible tattoos. Also, while little kids can (and often do) wear character costumes, adults (above age 14) are not allowed to do so, as it can cause confusion for other guests. (The costume rule is, of course, suspended for Halloween events!)\nWith few exceptions, children of any age are permitted to go anywhere the general public can go. But while no one comes to Walt Disney World expecting a purely adults-only experience, visitors often find themselves wanting some quiet, relaxing time away from small children. Be respectful of your fellow travelers and keep rambunctious kids out of adult areas like hotel lounges, or right up at the bar in a restaurant. (Well-behaved children who understand what behaving like an adult entails will be welcome in the lounges, though.) Oh, and about those exceptions: Victoria and Albert's is only for ages 10 and up; Trader Sam's Grog Grotto is 21+ after 8PM; and the nightclubs at Disney's Boardwalk are always 21+.\nA few more miscellaneous rules:\n\nSmoking, including e-cigarette vaping, is allowed in designated outdoor areas only. As of May 1, 2019, the smoking areas in each park and Disney Springs will be removed; the only remaining areas will be outside the parks and resorts.\nDisney requests that children under 14 be accompanied by someone at least age 14 at all times, though kids 7 and up can ride rides by themselves.\nAvoid all political, commercial and promotional activity (pamphleting, photography, speechifying, etc.).\nDon't feed the wildlife.\n\n\nCope\nThere's a way to get just about anything you might need while at Walt Disney World, although some may be more convenient than others.\nAll resorts have coin-operated laundry facilities, daily maid service, and at least one shop selling basic essentials and sundries.\nMost of the resorts have exercise facilities; at the value resorts, though, you'll have to be content with just using a jogging path or swimming in the pool. Deluxe resorts will have more extensive \"health club\" facilities\u2014in particular, the Grand Floridian's health club, attached to the spa, is quite spacious.\nIf you find yourself in need of a haircut, there are a number of options. Most interesting is the Harmony Barber Shop on Main Street U.S.A. in the Magic Kingdom; first haircuts are their specialty, but anyone can walk in for a trim. The Contemporary Resort, Coronado Springs, the Grand Floridian, and the Yacht and Beach Clubs also have hair salons.\nBaby Care Centers are available at each of the four main resorts; they have quiet nursing rooms, sanitary (and comfy!) changing tables, toddler-size potties, and emergency supplies for sale. They're great places for a parent to take a quiet break with the little ones.\nFor many years, weekly Catholic Masses were held at the Polynesian Resort, but not anymore. Today, the only religious services at Walt Disney World are on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day. On those days, two Catholic Masses and a Protestant service are held in the Contemporary's ballroom; see your front desk for the schedule. For normal weekly worship, you'll need to head off-property.\nYou can schedule a portrait session with a Disney photographer by contacting Disney Fine Art Photography; they have $350 and $150 packages available and will take pictures at one of several Disney resorts.\n\n\nChild care\nSometimes, parents want to spend some time for themselves at Walt Disney World, be it going to a fancy dinner, enjoying some alcoholic beverages, or even sneaking another ride on Space Mountain without the kids tagging along. Parents of teenagers can just set them loose in a theme park and trust they'll be all right, but younger kids require more supervision.\nWhat's a parent to do? There are a number of options.\nSeveral of the resorts offer safe and secure Children's Activity Centers, and you don't have to be staying at the resort to take advantage of them! The Centers are open daily from 4:30PM until midnight, and are well staffed by trained and certified child care personnel. Children must be potty trained and be between the ages of 4 and 12 (inclusive). The cost is $15 per hour per child, with a two-hour minimum; dinner is included if the kids are there between 6PM and 8PM. Your children will enjoy so many games, crafts, and activities that they won't even care you're off having fun without them. Of course, you'll be given a pager in case there's an emergency, and you can call at any time to check up on your kid.\n\nThe Children's Activity Centers include:\nCub's Den, Wilderness Lodge\nLilo's Playhouse (formerly The Neverland Club), Polynesian Village Resort\nSandcastle Club, Yacht and Beach Club Resorts (WDW resort guests only)\nSimba's Clubhouse, Animal Kingdom Lodge\nThe Walt Disney World Dolphin also has Club Dolphin, which has similar rules and prices. Club Dolphin offers up to two hours free if parents present a receipt from one of the Dolphin's signature restaurants or the Mandara Spa.\nIf your kids are too young for the activity centers, or you want to stay out past their bedtime, you can get in-room babysitting. WDW recommends Kid's Nite Out, +1-800-696-8105, but other equally reliable services operate in the area as well. Some, including Kid's Nite Out, offer 24/7 service. For one child, rates are $18 an hour, higher for more children.\n\n\nGo next\n\nWalt Disney World lies at the heart of an archetypal Floridian paradise, with enough attractions and activities outside of Disney property to fill a good-sized book. You'll need to arrange some sort of transportation\u2014be it rental car, municipal bus, or one of the many area shuttle services (see infobox)\u2014to get to these other attractions, but they are certainly worth a look if you have the time, or if you just want to get away from Disney for a while.\nFor a broad spectrum of entertainment options that go beyond the big three theme park complexes, the Go Orlando Card is available in increments of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days. It gives free admission and express entry to more than 30 attractions in and around Orlando and Kissimmee, including Legoland and the Kennedy Space Center. If you're not going to hit them all, you can save money by picking just a subset of the available attractions for your pass.\n\n\nTo Orlando...\nInternational Drive is Orlando's dynamic tourist corridor. With a multitude of attractions, dining, and shopping, it makes for the perfect side trip. Here you can also find Orlando's two other world-famous theme park resort complexes:\n\nSeaWorld Orlando - See Shamu and his friends perform the most fascinating animal shows ever. Also, cool off at the sister water park Aquatica, or swim with the dolphins at Discovery Cove. Admission to Discovery Cove is limited to 1,000 people a day, and reservations are an absolute must.\nUniversal Orlando Resort - Features Universal Studios Florida, Islands of Adventure, Volcano Bay, and CityWalk. It's where you'll find Harry Potter, Dr. Seuss, the Minions, and even Marvel superheroes and The Simpsons (both of which are the property of Disney). And the perfect way to wrap up your visit to Universal is by watching a performance.\n\n\n...and beyond\nIt's not just about Orlando, either; Central Florida is packed with attractions from coast to coast.\n\nTampa (I-4 west to I-75) \u2014 Theme park enthusiasts will come to Tampa for Busch Gardens, but there's plenty else to do and see in Florida's third most populous city, including Buccaneers football, Rays baseball, and Lightning hockey.\nClermont (I-4 to US 192 to US 27 N) \u2014 Check out one of the oldest central Florida landmarks, the Citrus Tower. Completed in 1956, this 226-foot observation tower still stands tall over former orange groves.\nDaytona Beach (I-4 east to I-95) \u2014 Home to NASCAR's most legendary racetrack. The Daytona 500 Experience is billed as \"The Official Attraction of NASCAR\", a must for car-racing fans.\nCape Canaveral (I-4 east to SR 528) \u2014 While countless cruise ships dock at Port Canaveral just to the north, the Cape is most well known for the Kennedy Space Center, where American astronauts have been launching into space since the 1960s. There's a museum on the history of space exploration, two IMAX theatres, and tour buses to the (otherwise restricted) launch facility.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\"We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious, and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.
