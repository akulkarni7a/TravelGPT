  "extract": "Toulon is a medium-sized city (15th town of France) between Marseille and Nice. It is in the west of French Riviera and in the southeast of Provence.\n\n\nUnderstand\n1 Office de Tourisme (Tourist Office), 12 place Louis Blanc, \u260f +33 4 94 18 53 00, info@toulontourisme.com. April - October: M-Sa 09:00-18:00, Su and holidays: 10:00-12:00; November - March: 09:00-17:00, Su and holidays: 10:00-12:00. (updated May 2015)\n Tourist information counter (in the lounge of the train station, next to the information point). M-Sa 09:00-13:00, 14:00-17:00. (updated May 2015)\n\n\nClimate\nClimate is typical of the South of France. The summers are relatively hot, with temperatures usually higher than 30 \u00b0C. June is a hot month but a sudden storm may occur every once in a while. July usually features hot temperatures and blue sky. August may be even hotter, but storms may begin to occur especially after the 15th of the month. Autumns are rainy. Storms will occur. Winters are dry. Temperatures don't usually drop sharply under 0 \u00b0C, but the wind factor causes a loss in Celsius degrees equal to one less degree per 10 km wind speed, thus with a wind blowing at 50 km/h 0\u00b0C will feel like minus 5\u00b0C.\nUnlike many other towns of France, there is no big river which crosses this city. As a matter of fact, there are no big rivers in the whole department of Var. A few smaller ones in the city are: Rivi\u00e8re neuve, Le Las, L'Eygoutier also known as Rivi\u00e8re des amoureux (lover's river for a no apparent reason). All the other rivers are in tunnels under the town, and not visible.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economy relies on the presence of a big French naval base that creates thousands of direct and indirect jobs. Tourism is also important. the town has up to 167,400 tourists every year\n\n\nHistory\nThe history of Toulon dates back 3000 years. The Ligures settled here because of exceptional conditions:\n\na hill protects the center of the town from the Mistral, a strong wind which blows in the southeast of France (you will experience wind almost everyday).\non the south face of the hill, several sources gush out, which is exceptional in the so dry Provence. The name Toulon is linked to Telona, an ancient Ligurian goddess of sources.\nthe hill (named Faron, about 500 m high) enables one to view boats arriving from very far away, specially enemy boats. The name Faron cames from the Greek pharos (English: lighthouse) for this reason. At the top of Faron, there still is a military camp dedicated to communications with submarines.\nthe water of the port is very calm, because it is protected by a peninsula (Saint-Mandrier) that nearly closes the port as a lagoon. It was possible to watch boats entering the port from there.\nFor all these reasons, Toulon early became a town of military vocation. When the Romans invaded the Provence (Latin: provincia romana), they settled a military base and renamed the town Telo Martius, where martius recalls Mars, the Roman god of war.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Provence was under the coup of lords, before being integrated into the French Kingdom in 1482. During the 18th century, Toulon became an important military port for France, were boats and sails were being built. A famous convict prison was built. During the French Revolution, Toulon gave support to the monarchy, but Bonaparte (later known as Napoleon I) took back the town. During World War II, Toulon was invaded on November 27, 1942. The seamen scuttled all the boats so that the Nazis couldn't use them. The town was freed by the Allied Forces on August 25, 1944. \n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Toulon-Hy\u00e8res regional airport (TLN  IATA) (18 km east of Toulon), \u260f +33 4 00 83 83, fax: +33 4 94 00 84 13. The airport mostly serves the flights to other French and European cities. There are flights from Brest, Nantes, Paris-Orly, and Strasbourg with Air France. Internationally, there are flights from Frankfurt with Condor, Copenhagen with Scandinavian Airlines, Geneva with Swiss International Airlines, and Rotterdam with Transavia. TUI operates flights from Brest and Charleroi. A bus runs from the train station to the airport 4 times a day (\u20ac1.40). The last bus leaves for the airport at 19:30. If you arrive on a late night flight into the airport, you'd need to take a taxi (around \u20ac60 to Toulon). Other airports are Marseille-Provence (100 km west of Toulon), and Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur (150 km east of Toulon). There are two roads drive to Toulon from Toulon-Hy\u00e8res airport. Either you follow the highway (free, fast, but not very interesting) (French: Toulon par autoroute) or you choose the road that follows the coast (French: Toulon par la c\u00f4te). It may take a longer time, but this is nicer and on rush hour you may avoid traffic jam on the highway.

It is NE of the harbour. As it was built in the Middle Ages, it's a really a maze of narrow streets. A couple of bigger ones, Rue d'Alger and Cours Lafayette, are bordered by numerous shops and crowded every Saturday.\n\n1 Vieux Port. Visit the old harbour and its promenade. The folk of old Provence, the typical accent of locals, and some wooden boats on the still sea (the folk is better in smaller town along the coast, however). Numerous souvenir shops, coffee shops and fish restaurants. Also on the port square, you'll see the statue of the Spirit of Navigation pointing at the sea, locally known as \"cul vers ville\" for its buttocks are turned toward the city. The statue was hidden and thought lost, during World War II, until it was found by chance in a local carpenter's shop who returned it to the authorities. (updated May 2015)\n2 Place Puget. In the historical centre, it's the ancient centre of the town. There is a fountain built in 1780 with a sculpture of three dolphins, now completely covered by ivy. You'll enjoy staying in the shade of this place, at a coffee shop, during a hot afternoon. (updated May 2015)\n3 Cathedral Notre-Dame-de-la-Seds (near Place Puget). (aka Saint Marie de la Seds Cathedral) Built in the 11th century, it has never been finished, but widened in 1738. There are numerous paintings of  the 18th century. (updated May 2015)\n4 Tour de l'horloge. (aka Tour Carr\u00e9e), a monumental clock at the entry of the naval base (at the west of the port), formerly used to ring at the beginning and at the end of the working day.

(updated May 2015)\n\n\nHaute Ville\nHaute Ville (upper town) is located on the north of the historical center. The most of the buildings and squares there are in splendor of the late XIXth century style. The major part of Haute Ville was built under the guidance of  Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann (aka \"Baron Haussmann\", who was later called to build Paris).\n\n7 Place de la Libert\u00e9. (Liberty plaza in English) This is one of the town's main square with a fountain of \"Monument de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration\", featuring a very idealized start of the journey of the Statue of Liberty from Toulon to New York on the frigate Isere. In winter, a skating rink is put up for children and there's a picturesque Christmas market featuring tasting of several specialties from around France during most of December. However this square may be noisy due to the main boulevard of the town running  just along the square. (updated May 2015)\n8 Opera of Toulon, place Victor Hugo (100 m east of the Place de la Libert\u00e9), \u260f +33 4 94 93 03 76.

Several paths allow hikers to walk across the forest and go to/from the museums, the zoo, the cable car, etc.\nAlexandre the 1st Garden (French: Jardin Alexandre Ier), at the west of the Municipal Library, garden opened with entertainment for young children, and a bandstand with casual concerts on Sundays.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral Garden (French: Jardin Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral), cours Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, garden with collections of exotic species.

The bottom is of pure sand (no seaweed) and the depth increases very very slowly.\nSt Cyr sur Mer some 20 km west of Toulon features a long sandy beach, perfect for families and kitesurfers. There too the seabed drops rather slowly, enabling one to reach way out into the water.\n\n\nSport\nRC Toulon \u2014 A club with a proud history, the rouge et noir (red and black) are a major force in French and European rugby, thanks to a deep-pocketed owner (comic publisher and Toulon native Mourad Boudjellal). Toulon, who play at Stade Mayol in the heart of the city, have assembled an impressive array of international stars, and won an unprecedented three consecutive European club championship crowns from 2013 to 2015.
