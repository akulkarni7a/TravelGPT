Sometimes, you might be offered a dessert called mazamorra, which is corn and milk with local sugar cane, called 'panela'.

Also, both sites at Santa Rosa have incredible, breathtaking waterfalls that are lit with multi-colored lights, visiting at night is best, or if you have time, stay all day as price of entry is for all day!\nSalento - The little colonial town known for its coffee farms, gateway to the famous Valle de Cocora and a great gateway point for treks to Los Nevados National Park.",
