  "extract": "Ulm is a town at the edge of Bavaria in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, southwestern Germany. It is home to the highest church steeple in the world (161.53 m), even higher than the Cathedral (Dom in German) of Cologne.\n\n\nUnderstand\nWith a population of 127,000 inhabitants (2017), Ulm forms an urban district and administrative centre of the region. Ulm, founded around 850, is rich in history and traditions as a former Free Imperial City (German: freie Reichsstadt). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of a university. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world (161.53 m or 529.95 feet), the Gothic Ulm minster (German: Ulmer M\u00fcnster) and as the birthplace of Albert Einstein.\nUlm lies at the Danube river and is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over 620 m, which are part of the  Swabian Mountains. Because of the Danube Ulm sees a lot of dense fog especially in late autumn and early spring. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are on the north-west bank of the Danube. On the other side of the river lies the twin city of Neu-Ulm in the state of Bavaria.\nAround the city, there are many statues of sparrows (Spatzen). Spatzen is a nickname for the residents of Ulm and a symbol of the city.  Legend says that, while building the cathedral, the workers couldn't figure out how to get the long wooden beams into the church until they noticed a sparrow entering its nest while holding a piece of straw lengthwise, instead of sideways.\n\n\nTalk\nStandard German is understood by everyone, but the local dialect is Swabian (Schw\u00e4bisch).\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nThe 1 Ulm Hauptbahnhof (main station).    is in the town centre, about a 10-minute walk from the cathedral (Ulmer M\u00fcnster). Ulm is about an hour from Stuttgart and 1\u00bd-2 hours from Munich.\n\nThere are special train tickets called L\u00e4nder-Tickets for travel within a region, such as Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg or Bavaria (Bayern). With this ticket up to five people can use all regional trains for a whole day for only \u20ac22 (one person) \u2013 \u20ac38 (five persons). Prices may change, so check the Deutsche Bahn website for the latest prices.\n\n\nBy plane\nFrom these airports you can take the ICE or IC train to get to Ulm.\n\nMunich Airport (MUC IATA) 150 km from Ulm, about 2\u00bd hours by train. The airport has an S-Bahn station, which connects to other Munich train stations.\nStuttgart Airport (STR IATA), 90 km from Ulm\nFriedrichshafen Airport (FDH IATA), also known as Bodensee-Airport, Friedrichshafen in Friedrichshafen close to Lake Constance\nMemmingen Airport (FMM IATA) near Memmingen, which is roughly 60 km away. Served (and sometimes deceptively marketed as being closer to Munich than it really is) primarily by no frills airlines\nFrankfurt airport (FRA IATA) is a farther away than all the other listed airports, but may serve as your entry point if none of the closer options aligns with your plans. Deutsche Bahn and most airlines have entered rail air alliances to offer combination tickets for the train ride and the flight in one package, which might work out to be the cheapest and/or most comfortable option.\n\n\nBy car\nUlm is near the intersection of the A7 and A8 autobahns.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe town centre is small enough to walk around, but there are lots of buses and even sightseeing boats on the Danube (Donau) River. There's a Stra\u00dfenbahn with two intersecting lines. Route planner is available online.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nSights\n1 Ulmer M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnsterplatz 1.
