It was formed in 1988 from the northern two-fifths of the state of Goi\u00e1s.\nThe Rio Tocantins has been dammed for hydropower, creating a large reservoir that has become a center of recreation. Because it is in the central zone of the country, Tocantins has characteristics of the Amazon Basin, and also semi-open pastures, known as cerrado. The Bananal Island (Ilha do Bananal), in the southwest of the state, is the second largest fluvial island in the world. Tocantins is also home to the Araguaia National Park, the Caraj\u00e1s Indian reservations, and Jalap\u00e3o State Park. There, the rivers create oases in the dry landscape, attracting many ecotourists to the region.\nThe geography of Tocantins is varied. It straddles the Amazon rainforest and the coastal savanna. Many rivers (including the Tocantins River) traverse the state.\n\n\nClimate\nMost of Tocantins (except the extreme western and northern regions) is situated within a vast Brazilian area known as the cerrado. The cerrado region's typical climate is hot and semi-humid, with pronounced seasonal variation marked by a dry winter from May through October.\n\n\nGet in\nPalmas\u2013Brigadeiro Lysias Rodrigues Airport (PMW  IATA receives flights from \nBelo Horizonte\u2013Confins, Campinas, Goi\u00e2nia, Recife, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos, Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o, and Salvador da Bahia.
