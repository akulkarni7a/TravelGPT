Calles are abbreviated as C, Cll and Cl.\nAvenidas, abbreviated as Av, are usually larger and main streets. The numerical system for the Avenidas is used but some have names that are more commonly used such as Avenida Libertadores or Avenida de Los Faroles. Each address consists of a series of numbers, for example: Av. 4 #12-24. This indicates that the building on Av. 4 is 24 meters from the corner. The city's avenues are numbered both east to west and west to east, starting from a central avenue numbered 0 (Avenida Cero).
