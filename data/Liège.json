  "extract": "Li\u00e8ge (German: L\u00fcttich, Dutch: Luik) is the largest city of Wallonia. This industrial city is actually quite green, with wide boulevards, an interesting, if a bit disorderly, mix of architecture from different periods, much greenery and picturesque riverbanks and hillsides. There are also quite a few museums and other points of interest, enough for at least a busy day trip. \n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAt the foot of Ardennes on the river Meuse, it has been a prominent urban centre since the Middle Ages, but really blossomed during the industrial revolution, when it grew to become Belgium's third-largest metropolis, after Brussels and Antwerp. Thanks to its strategic position, Li\u00e8ge still enjoys relative affluence and economic importance, in contrast to its fellow Wallon cities farther south.\nDespite its size and location in-between some of the most-visited cities in Europe, Li\u00e8ge sees very little tourist traffic. It is the largest city of Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium, and the capital city of the namesake province.\nLi\u00e8ge has been an important city since the early Middle Ages. It was the capital of the Principality (prince-bishopric) of Li\u00e8ge, which remained an independent state until the French Revolution (around 1789). In the 19th century it became an early centre of industrialism. Today it is a large city of 200,000 inhabitants, with a total 750,000 in its metropolitan area. A city heavily shaped by waves of immigrants, Li\u00e8ge has important Italian (making up at least 5% of the population), Spanish, German, Moroccan, Turkish, and Sub-Saharan African communities (the latter being one of the largest in Belgium).\nThe central area of Li\u00e8ge presents itself as a rather interesting mix of a historic town centre (dotted with a few extremely brutalist buildings from the 1960s and 70s), a rather elegant new town with wide boulevards, tall apartment buildings (some Art Deco), narrow street with small businesses, a few pretty parks, and a few interesting shopping arcades. The outskirts of Li\u00e8ge consist mainly of 3 very distinctive areas: large industrial complexes sprawling on the river's bank in the north and the south (with the cities of Seraing and Herstal), working-class areas in the east and the west with mainly spare green neighborhood for healthy people, and several affluent suburbs dispersed here and there.\nLi\u00e8ge sits at the beginning of the Ardennes, which makes the landscape of the south very different than the rest of the city, with high hills and abundant forests (Sart-tilman and beyond).\n\n1 Tourist office (Office Du Tourisme De Liege), F\u00e9ronstr\u00e9e 92, \u260f +32 4 221 92 21. Mid-May to end of Sep: M-Sa 09:00 \u2013 17:00, Su 09:00 - 16:00. (updated May 2024)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Li\u00e8ge airport (LGG  IATA). Specialising in freight (7th biggest cargo airport in Europe), the airport sees mainly seasonal holiday charter flights to destinations around the Mediterranean. Regular passenger connections are provided by some airlines seeking opportunities to capitalise on local business interests (and charging accordingly). Reaching the city centre with public transportation is a bit tricky. Check the TEC (local city bus) website for further information.   \nBrussels Airport is your most likely point of entry into Belgium. To reach Li\u00e8ge, take the train to Louvain/Leuven, or Brussels-Nord and change for Li\u00e8ge.\nBrussels South Charleroi Airport, located in Charleroi, is an alternative for low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and WizzAir. From the airport, take the city bus Line A (stop is outside of the departure hall), which costs \u20ac6 one way to Charleroi-Sud (south) train station, then the train to Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins. Train departs once every hour from 05:00. Last train leaves at 23:00. The trip takes approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes.\nMaastricht Airport is also close to the city. Ryanair has some service from the city (a lot less than Charleroi though). Transportation to Li\u00e8ge can be done by taking a bus to Maastricht station, then taking a train.\nCologne-Bonn Airport, in the neighbouring North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany, is a mid-sized airport that serves as base for many low-cost carriers such as easyJet, Eurowings, and Ryanair. Reaching Li\u00e8ge from that airport takes just under 1\u00bd hours by car, and about 2 hours by train with a change in Cologne.\nFrankfurt Airport has a thrice daily direct high-speed train link to Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins. More frequencies can be found if you make a stop in Cologne.\n\n\nBy train\n\n2 Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins is the main station, 3 km south of the centre, with bold modern architecture by Santiago Calatrava. Thalys and ICE high-speed trains serve Brussels, Paris, Aachen, Cologne and Frankfurt. \nFrom Brussels, intercity trains run at least hourly and take 50 min from Brussels Nord. From Brussels Airport, take the airport shuttle to Leuven then the intercity train. From the Netherlands change in Maastricht, with hourly trains taking 30 min.\nNightjet, the Austrian Railways' sleeper train, runs three nights a week from Brussels via Li\u00e8ge to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck. It calls at Aachen, Cologne, Bonn, Koblenz, Frankfurt airport, W\u00fcrzburg and Nuremberg where the train divides: one portion runs via Linz to Vienna, the other via Munich to Innsbruck. \nTo get downtown from Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins, either change to the frequent regional train to Li\u00e8ge-St-Lambert (7 min), or take Bus 1 or 4 bus just outside the station to Place St-Lambert or Bus 48 towards Op\u00e9ra, or take a taxi. Those buses run both ways at the station bus stop so check the destination board.\n3 Li\u00e8ge-St-Lambert is the downtown station, with regional trains from Aachen, Verviers and Merken.\nComing from Germany with the Deutschland-Ticket, take a regional train to Aachen. Then a Belgium regional train (\u20ac11, hourly) to Li\u00e8ge. Booking the train on the Belgium train website costs less than booking it at the Deutsche Bahn counterpart . (updated Mar 2024)\n\n\nBy car\nLi\u00e8ge is the crossroads for several major motorways. Its \"ring\" has 6 branches in clockwise order:\n\nthe E25, to the south, towards Luxembourg and into France via Metz, Nancy, Lyon\nthe E42, to the west, crosses Wallonia via Mons/Bergen before entering France via Valenciennes, Paris\nthe E40, to the west, leading to the Belgian coast via Brussels\nthe E313, leading to Antwerp and on to the large coastal cities of the Netherlands\nthe E25, to the north, with Maastricht a stone's throw away (30 km) and the rest of the Netherlands beyond\nthe E40, to the east, entering Germany via Aachen.  A second branch (Actually the E42) splits off at Verviers, heading to Trier.\nSince it is a fairly large city, many motorway exits are signposted for \"Li\u00e8ge\".  When coming from Germany or Netherlands, follow the E25 to its end, then follow the road signs to the center.  If you are coming from Luxembourg, exit at \"Angleur\" and follow signs to the center, or to continue on to the exit marked \"Li\u00e8ge-centre\". Finally, coming from Paris, Lille, Brussels, or Antwerp, follow signs to Luxembourg until you reach the exit marked \"Li\u00e8ge-centre.\" When coming from Flanders, Li\u00e8ge is named as \"Luik.\"\nThere are a number of covered car parks in the centre costing \u20ac2.20 an hour.\n\n\nBy bus\n4 Li\u00e8ge Guillemins long distance bus station (Near the train station). \nLi\u00e8ge is well-connected by bus, notably by Flixbus and BlablaCar Bus.\n\n\nBy boat\nIndividuals arriving with their own boat are welcome at the port des Yachts.\nMany organised cruises departing from Maastricht stop in the centre of Li\u00e8ge, on the right bank (quai Marcatchou to quai Van Beneden).\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\nUnlike most Belgian cities, Li\u00e8ge has no inner ring built along the path of the old city walls.  Instead, the main streets were laid out along the old branches of the river, which makes their organisation a bit obscure.\nLeave your car in one of the city-centre parking garages, especially if you have no map of to your destination.\nHere are the main routes for cars:\n\nthe motorway E40-E25 that crosses parts of the city\nthe Boulevards \"d'Avroy\" and \"de la Sauveni\u00e8re\", the main route between the center and the train station\nthe Quais \"de la Meuse\" and \"de la D\u00e9rivation\", which link to/from the two branches of the E25\n\n\nBy bus\nA new tram line will start operation in Li\u00e8ge on 15 April 2025; thus, some bus routes will change on that date.\nTEC is the main bus company. Most lines converge towards one of the city-center bus \"terminals.\" These terminals are located at Place Saint-Lambert, Gare L\u00e9opold, Place de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise, and around the Op\u00e9ra/Theater (all the four are very close to one another). The names of these five sites are used to indicate the direction of the bus, according to the line taken.\nSeveral other lines leave from the train station Li\u00e8ge-Guillemins. Among them, two lines link the station with city centre: the #4, a circular line (direction \"Bavi\u00e8re\" to go from the station to the centre, direction \"d'Harscamp\" for the reverse trip), and the #1 which runs train station to city center and on to Coronmeuse. There also is a few lines that start from the intersection of the Boulevard d'Avroy and the \"Pont d'Avroy\", the main shopping street. Few lines run after midnight.\nMore and more bus stops now show the waiting time for the next bus on each line, and many buses are equipped to display the next stop and adapted for people with reduced mobility. Nevertheless, be aware that the next stop screens are not always synchronised with the bus stops. For people using a bus line they're not familiar with, ask the driver to warn you when you are arriving at the bus stop you are looking for. You can ask for a free printed version of each bus schedule at the terminal of the line.\n\n\nBy bike\nTravelling by bike in the city centre is easy, but the hillsides can be a bit steep (between 5 and 15%).  Reaching the higher neighbourhoods will require a bit of training and a multi-speed bike!\nCycling paths are regularly added and improved, though the main roads remain a bit dangerous.  Most one-way streets can be travelled in the opposite direction by cyclists. A map of cycling paths is available at the tourist information office. In addition, there's a \"Ravel\" (a path for walkers and cyclists) along the right bank of the river Meuse.\n\nLa Maison des Cyclistes\n\n\nBy scooter\nMultiple electric scooter rental companies operate in the city such as Dott and Pony. Scooters are scattered all over the city therefore are easy to find.\n\n\nBy foot\nMost of the areas in city centre are easily accessible on foot, and walking provides an interesting perspective on the city itself. The trip from the train station at Guillemins to the city centre requires a bit more timeL about 30 min.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nHistoric Centre\n\n1 Place St. Lambert is a major square in the centre, where a number of key sights may be found. It was the site of Gothic Cathedral of Our Lady and St (Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Lambert), representation of religious power, torn down at the start of the 19th century after the revolution of Li\u00e8ge and today memorialized by metal columns and a design traced on the ground. At Place Saint Lambert 9-17, admire the neo-classic fa\u00e7ades, dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n2 Palace of the Prince-Bishops. Composed of the Palace of Justice (classic fa\u00e7ade at Place Saint Lambert 18) and the Provincial Palace (lateral neo-gothic fa\u00e7ade at place Notger 2). This palace is the heart of the city, and represents the political power of the old Prince-Bishops of Li\u00e8ge. \n3 arch\u00e9oforum, \u260f +32 4 250 93 70.

Perron, and houses along the market square. The town hall, is an elegant classic building. It was built in 1714, during reconstruction after the French attacks in 1691. It can be visited on rare occasions only, except for the \"salle des pas perdus\" - \"room of lost steps\" which is freely accessible. The houses on the square, with their charming blue stone and brick faces, date from the same period. The Perron, symbol of the city's freedom, is at the center of the square above the fountain that acts as its support. The perron is one of the symbols of the city and was used to render justice. \n\nOther sights in the historic city centre include:\n\n5 H\u00f4tel d\u2019Ansembourg (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ansembourg), Feronstr\u00e9e 114, \u260f +32 4 221 9402, museum@liege.be.

Constructed between 1881 and 1884 as a Belgian defensive measure against Germany, Fort de Loncin was attacked during the Battle of Li\u00e8ge, the first battle of the invasion of Belgium during the First World War. While a pinnacle of fortification throughout the 1880s, it was destroyed by the largest artillery pieces of the German field army, showing the rapid developments of the late nineteenth century and the technological warfare of the First World War. While defeated, the valiant defense of Li\u00e8ge delayed the German assault on France by four to five days, giving the Entente time to prepare their defenses. The remnants and ruins of the fort still remain as well as a museum and monument. adult \u20ac7 / student \u20ac5 / child \u20ac3.

The market typically runs from early morning to 2 o'clock in the afternoon every weekend year long. Produce, clothing, and snack vendors are the main concentration of the market.\nFlea Markets at Saint Gilles (every Saturday morning on Boulevard Louis Hillier) and Saint Pholien (every Friday morning on Boulevard de la Constitution) also attract many visitors.\n\n\nTypical purchases\n\nVal Saint Lambert crystal, now sold throughout the world, makes an exceptional gift in the \"splurge\" category.\nThe tourist information office sells local artists' products including scarfs with medieval motifs and ties with contemporary artistic designs.\nMarionnettes of \"Tchantch\u00e8s\", a character from local folklore embodying the Li\u00e9geois attitude, are available in the 6 marionette theaters in the city.\nOther typical purchases are food and drink products:\n\nAs elsewhere in Belgium, pralines (filled chocolates) and the numerous cheeses and beers are a must.\nLocal products include \"Herve\" cheese (with a strong smell!), \"Sirop de Li\u00e8ge\" (made from a mix of apples and pears and typically used for cooking/baking), and cider (the alcoholic kind).\n\"P\u00e8k\u00e8t\" (geni\u00e8vre) is an alcoholic beverage available in countless varieties.\nFor sweets, you can't go far without encountering the famous Li\u00e8ge waffles, smelling of cinnamon and sugar.  They're best when freshly-cooked, though the pre-packaged variety also exists and has spread to many other countries.\nOther sweets are available depending on the season: bo\u00fbk\u00e8tes (dark cr\u00eapes with raisins, eaten with brown sugar) are mainly available for 15 August and at Christmas, while lacquemants/lackmans (dry waffles filled with a mix of sugar and other sweets) are found at the fairs.\nIf you find them, try \"c\u00fbt\u00e8s pe\u00fbres\" (baked pears), which unfortunately seems to have disappeared from the street vendors.\nLi\u00e8ge coffee (caf\u00e9 li\u00e9geois) is originally from Vienna but was rebaptised by the Parisiens to show their support for the heroic resistance in Li\u00e8ge at the start of the first world war.\n\n\nShopping in city centre\nThe best options for shopping are around Place Cath\u00e9drale and Place Saint Lambert, and in particular at Vin\u00e2ve d'Ile (Celio...), Saint-Michel (Van den Borre, Delhaize, C&A), the Opera Galleries (Zara, Springfield) and the Saint Lambert Galleries (FNAC, M\u00e9dia Markt, Inno, Champion), as well as along the roads towards the center (rues F\u00e9ronstr\u00e9e, Saint-Gilles, Puits-en-Sock in Outremeuse, Gr\u00e9try in Longdoz.)\n\n\nShopping outside city centre\nSeveral large commercial centres are on the outskirts of the city:\n\n1 Belle-Ile, Quai des Vennes 1 (take bus 377 from the Opera) (Angleur)). North-American style shopping mall with Carrefour on site. \n2 M\u00e9diacit\u00e9 shopping centre, Boulevard Raymond Poincar\u00e9 7 (easily accessible by car (with on-site carparking) or bus -  4, 26, 26, 31, 17, 29, 33, 35, 38B (Pont Longdoz stop), Rocourt, Boncelles, Herstal.). 126 stores \n3 Hypermarkt Carrefour Herstal, Rue Basse Campagne 1, Herstal. Large supermarket. Has a small international section (Italian, Spain, USA, UK, Asia, North Africa) for those missing things from home. \n\n\nEat\n\nIn addition to the local foods mentioned above, regional specialities include:\n\nboulets sauce-lapin, meatballs in a sauce made from Sirop de Li\u00e8ge, onions, vinegar and prunes, accompanied of course by frites - french fries. The boulet even has its own critics and reviews.\nla pot\u00e9e li\u00e9geoise, a country dish made from beans, potatoes, and bacon bits cooked together and drenched in vinegar.\nles bo\u00fbk\u00e8tes, dark cr\u00eapes served at New Year's Eve or other festive occasions\nle matouf\u00e8t, a cross between a cr\u00eape and an omelette, made from flour, eggs, milk and bacon bits, and served either salty or sweet.\nla tarte au riz, originally from the neighboring city of Verviers or the area of Tancr\u00e9mont\n\nOther local recipes are available online.\nPrices unfortunately are fairly high, as in most other Belgian cities. Budget restaurants will cost about \u20ac12-15 per person, drinks included, mid-range restaurants between \u20ac25 and \u20ac50, and splurge restaurants well over that!\nFor budget solutions, snack shops like any of the sandwicheries or kebab shops offer cheap yet tasty food. A D\u00f6ner kebab typically costs 3-5 euro, and a sandwich is around 2-4. In Li\u00e8ge all snack shops charge 50 cents for sauce, and usually another 50 cents for vegetables. For example you can see a meatball sandwich for \u20ac2 on the price list; however, after the sauce and the vegetables it will be \u20ac3 in total. It is recommended to look for convenient stores for soft drinks as they're over-priced in snack bars.\nObtaining meals outside of conventional times can be a challenge: Many restaurants do not serve between 2 and 6 in the afternoon, those that do tend to be full and you can expect to wait some time for service.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Le Clo\u00eetre, Cour des Mineurs (inside the Museum of Walloon Life (Mus\u00e9e de la Vie wallonne)). That restautant has the traditional dishes of Li\u00e8ge. It goes together with Flemish fries and the sauce of Li\u00e8ge. (updated Feb 2023)\n2 Brasserie Sauveni\u00e8re (Les Grignoux), Pl.

(updated Apr 2018)\nIn addition, many of the caf\u00e9s in the Le Carr\u00e9 area are a good alternative, with plenty of dancing and typically no entrance fee.\n\n\nSleep\n\nFor a city of its size, Li\u00e8ge has surprisingly few accommodation facilities. This is both due to the city's relatively low popularity as a tourist destination and the fact that it is between 1 and 3 hours from many major cities where business traffic to it originates. You may want to take advantage of the latter yourself and stay anywhere closer or farther and come to the city for the day.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Youth Hostel Georges Simenon (Les Auberges de Jeunesse), Rue Georges Simenon 2, \u260f +32 4 344 56 89.

City centre hotel on the banks of the river La Meuse, built in a former convent.  Free Wifi. \n\n\nStay safe\nLi\u00e8ge is generally a safe city during daytime. However, be cautious at night, especially if you are a woman. It is not recommended for women to walk alone in the evenings, as many foreign female students have been followed late at night. Robbery is rare, but harassment of single females occurs often. It is mostly verbal, but some travelers have been assaulted in off-downtown areas. If where you're staying is more than a 5-min walk from the centre, it is safest to take a cab (they have a queues around the Opera and Pont d'Avroy Bus Terminal) after 22:00.\n\n\nConnect\nLi\u00e8ge has 4G from all Belgian carriers.
