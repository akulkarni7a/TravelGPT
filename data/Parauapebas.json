This is true frontier country: There was virtually nothing in this region until the world's largest iron ore mine, at neighbouring Serra dos Caraj\u00e1s was set into production in the early 1980s. The city still has an air of pioneers and adventurers.\n\n\nGet in\nMarab\u00e1, some 200 km off is the regional bus hub, for transport onwards to Bel\u00e9m (about 12 hours), Imperatriz (about 10 hours) or Bras\u00edlia.
