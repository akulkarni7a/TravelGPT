  "extract": "Isla Gorgona is a Pacific Ocean island of Colombia, 35 km from the mainland.\n\n\nUnderstand\nParque Nacional Natural Isla Gorgona is a small island 35 km off the Colombian Pacific Coast. There are 2 main islands (Gorgona and Gorgonilla) and 2 tiny rocky keys. The main island of Gorgona is around 26 km2 in area. There are no permanent residents on the island.\n\n\nHistory\n\nSpanish conquerors visited the island for periods of time from the 15th to the 18th century. Simon Bolivar, liberator of Colombia, gave the island to an English soldier who helped with the local war of independence against Spain. The island was retained by his descendants until the mid-20th century when the country claimed back the territory (by law, all islands belong to the central government).\nIt was a prison island from 1960 until 1984 when the prison was closed and the island became a national park. The ancient houses of the personnel working at the prison were remodeled and reconverted into a research center, comfortable accommodation and a restaurant. Since 1985 exuberant rainforest grown again reclaimed the island. A section of the old prison can be still visited. In the 21st century a concession was given to a tourist company to run a private and secluded hotel.\n\n\nLandscape\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe island is covered with tropical forest, which includes 46 species of reptile, 18 of these snakes, bats, sloths, monkeys, tortoises, and the abundant marine life in its waters which can be seen snorkeling from the beach or diving.\nThe ocean is roamed by sea turtles, whales, whalesharks, whitetip sharks and a lot of other fish species.\nFrom mid-June till November is whale season. Male humpback whales can be seen breaching while the females and their offspring come close to the island at the surface to breath.\n\n\nClimate\nWarm and wet.\n\n\nGet in\n\nThe only way to get there is by boats, which leave from three places on the mainland.\n\n\nFrom Buenaventura\nThere are several ways to get to the island by boat from Buenaventura: cargo ships, dive boats, and launches.\nThe cargo ships typically leave from the Muelle el Pi\u00f1al in the afternoon (4PM-6PM) and are headed south towards Satinga.\n\nBodega Lizcano (Muelle el Pi\u00f1al), +57 2 244-6106, has overcrowded cargoboats shipping food and wood to the southern part of the country.
