Nestled among the forested hills of the Serra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os, in the valley of the Quitandinha and Piabanha rivers, Petr\u00f3polis is a popular summer holiday spot. Besides the climate and surroundings, the main attraction is the former Summer Palace of the Brazilian Emperors, which is now a museum, specializing in Imperial history and memorabilia.\n\n\nUnderstand\nIn the 1830s, the area of modern-day Petr\u00f3polis was little more than farmland. When Emperor Dom Pedro I went through there on his way to Minas Gerais, he was struck by the scenery and decided to buy some land. Dom Pedro I returned to Portugal soon after and the land was passed to his son, Dom Pedro II, who built a summer retreat. Soon a palace was built along with mansions and a cathedral, giving its nickname, \"The Imperial City\".\nPetr\u00f3polis is home to the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC), a research unit of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Brazilian Federal Government.\n\n\nTourism information office\n Centro da Informa\u00e7\u00e3o Tur\u00edstica - Main Branch, Centro de Cultura Raul de Leoni, Pra\u00e7a Visconde de Mau\u00e1 305, \u260f 0800 024-1516 (domestic).
