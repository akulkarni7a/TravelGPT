  "extract": "Dublin (Irish: Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, \"Town of the Hurdled Ford\") is the capital city of Ireland. Its vibrancy, nightlife and tourist attractions are world renowned and it's the most popular entry point for international visitors to Ireland.\nAs a city, it is disproportionately large for the size of the country with a population of over 2 million in the Greater Dublin Region (2022); nearly half of the Republic's population lives in this metropolitan area. The central sights can be navigated by foot, with a few outlying sights, and suburbs sprawling out for miles.\nThe climate is mild, making Dublin a year-round destination. It's seldom freezing in winter, cool in summer and frequently has light showers. For more information, see County Dublin weather chart.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nDublin is in a low-lying, fertile area, not boggy by Irish standards, and with good sea access. It became the core of the Gaelic kingdom of Leinster, and the Vikings established a large settlement by what is now Dublin castle, until ejected by Brian Boru at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. This set a pattern that Dublin was fought for, not fought in. The Normans colonised the southwest and Leinster from the 12th century, and further out they battled with the Gaels, but Dublin sat snug within the \"Pale\" \u2014 the defensive palisade. Similarly with the Tudor conquests; then the city fell swiftly to Cromwell so his atrocities were elsewhere, and King William marched in unopposed after the Battle of the Boyne. 18th century Dublin was the second largest city in the British Isles, with a tight little Protestant clique ruling the place to London's liking. Industry and culture flourished, and the city acquired its graceful Georgian streets and squares, but Ireland was ruled as a colony. Britain's other colonies watched with great interest as the independence movement gathered pace.\n\"The Troubles\" of the late 19th and early 20th century involved ethnic conflicts, paramilitary gangs, and savage reprisals by the authorities. The outbreak of the First World War seemed to put a brake on this, with tens of thousands of Irishmen marching away to France and Flanders. Surely one big push on the Somme would win this war - but while the generals were planning this, armed insurrection broke out at Easter 1916. The rebels seized the central Post Office on O'Connell Street, read their proclamation of independence, then were bombarded until they surrendered. Initially they attracted little sympathy or support, especially as they were backed by arch-foe Germany, but the authorities snatched defeat from a quick win by the subsequent court-martials and executions by firing squad. Hundreds were arrested and 15 were shot. This and atrocities such as the Croke Park massacre were fatal to the legitimacy of British rule. By 1921, the Irish tricolour fluttered over a Dublin that was capital of a separate state.\n\n\nOrientation\n\nDublin is divided by the River Liffey. North of the Liffey runs O'Connell Street the main thoroughfare, intersected by numerous shopping streets such as Henry Street and Mary Street. On the south bank are Merrion Square, St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street (the main southside shopping area), Trinity College, Christ Church and St Patrick's Cathedrals, the main branches of the National Museum, and many other attractions.\nThe postal district Dublin 1 is north of the river centred on the Post Office, Dublin 2 is south centred on Trinity College, and so on out to the suburbs. These districts have been incorporated into Eircodes, which cover the whole Republic. Thus D04 followed by four alphanumerics is somewhere around Ballsbridge. These pages state Eircodes wherever possible, as keying them into an online map will drop you onto the exact address. They only apply to addresses that receive mail so a lonely megalithic tomb on a mountainside won't have one, but that's seldom an issue in downtown Dublin.\nVisitor info: Several places purport to be tourist information offices, but are simply agencies selling tours. The official source of advice is Visit Dublin, with two walk-in centres:\n\nNorthside at 14 O'Connell St Upper D01 WP59, 200 yards north of the post office, M-Sa 9AM-5PM;\nSouthside at 3 Palace St D02 T277, next to City Hall west end of Temple Bar, M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 10:30AM-3PM.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nMain article: Dublin Airport\n1 Dublin Airport (DUB IATA) (10 km north of city centre). Dublin Airport has an extensive short and medium haul network, and is the base for Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional, and Ryanair. Terminal 2 handles wide-bodied jets and is used by Aer Lingus (& Regional), American Airlines, Delta, Emirates, Norwegian and United. All others use the older Terminal 1, some 300 m north with a walkway between. Together they offer direct flights from most major cities in the UK (serving all London airports, but most frequently Heathrow) and Europe (including Keflav\u00edk, Moscow and Istanbul). North American flights arrive from New York, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington (with pre-clearance of US customs & immigration westbound) and Toronto. Middle East flights include Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi. Domestic flights are from Kerry and Donegal; there are none from Belfast, Shannon or Cork. All the main car hire companies have kiosks in Arrivals. There's a better choice here than in the city centre, but book ahead for the best deals. The airport has car parking short-term on-site, long-term off-site, and \"meet & greet\" services. The currency kiosks are run by ICE with a 10% buy/sell spread, decent value. Radisson Blu and Maldron hotels are at the airport, with a few more at the M1/M50 junction just south and in Swords to the north.   (updated Jun 2024)\nBetween airport and city: bus and taxi are the options, there's no rail / metro link.\n\n Aircoach. Aircoach 700 runs to the city centre from T1 then T2, every 15-30 min,taking 30 min, fare in 2024 is \u20ac10 single or \u20ac15 return. The last bus to the city is 1:30AM then the next is 6AM. See below for Aircoach 701, 702 and 703 for south side of Dublin. They also run to other cities such as Cork and Belfast. Taxi drivers routinely try to pick up passengers waiting at the Aircoach stop: they're forbidden to do so, but offer a similar rate and get many takers, so they persist. (updated Jul 2024)\nDublin Express runs to city centre and Heuston Station every 10 minutes or so. The last bus to the city is 11PM then the next is 5:30AM. The cost in September 2024 was \u20ac8 single. \u20ac10 return if purchased online.\n\nLocal buses by Dublin Bus are much slower \u2014 allow an hour \u2014 but much cheaper at \u20ac2.60 in coins, or \u20ac2 if paying with a Leap Card (see \"Get around\"), and may be more convenient for the suburbs. The two routes are:\nBus 16 via Drumcondra railway station, O'Connell St, George's St and out to the southern suburbs of Rathmines and Ballanteer / Kingstown. It runs from morning until late evening.\nBus 41 via Drumcondra railway station and O'Connell St, passing near Bus\u00e1ras, to Lower Abbey St. Northbound it runs out to Swords. It runs 24 hours every 20-30 minutes.\nStops for the local buses are at Terminal 1 through the car park opposite Arrivals exit and then to the right. Pay with exact coins (bus drivers don't accept cards or banknotes, and don't give change). Alternatively, purchase a prepaid Leap Card (see \"Get around\") from a convenience store in the terminal or near the bus stops. Luggage space is limited on these local buses, and it's not unknown for drivers to turn away travellers with packs that cannot be stored.\nTaxis to city centre might cost \u20ac34-40 (July 2024), so they are competitive with the Aircoach for a group of three or more. See \"Get around\" for rules on taxis.\nOther destinations: most buses to other Irish cities run via the airport, see individual cities' \"Get in\". Within County Dublin:\n\nBus 101 runs every 20 min to Balrothery, Balbriggan and Drogheda. This bus runs from Dublin Talbot St via Drumcondra but is not available for journeys just between city, airport and Swords.\nBus 102 runs from the airport every 30 min to Swords, Malahide, Portmarnock and Sutton near Howth.\nDrumcondra (Bus 16 & 41) has trains from Connolly towards Maynooth.\nAircoach Bus 700 runs to Leopardstown and Sandyford, 702 to  Bray and Greystones, and 703 to D\u00fan Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney.\n\n\nBy train\n\nThe country's railways converge on the city: see Irish Rail for timetables, fares and online tickets, and see also Rail travel in Ireland.\n2 Connolly (St\u00e1isi\u00fan U\u00ed Chonghaile), Amiens St, Dublin 1 (200 m north of bus station). Ticket office 6:30AM-7PM. This serves the north plus the east coast, with trains from Sligo (3 hr), Belfast via Drogheda (2 hr), and Rosslare ferry port via Wexford and Wicklow (3 hr). From Derry change in Belfast. Connolly is also the hub for local DART trains. It has toilets, ATM and small shops, and a bar and restaurant. The surrounding area is tacky at night; the station is closed between midnight and 5AM M-Sa, 7AM Sunday. Many Irish railway stations are named for those executed for their part in the Easter Rising - the British thoughtfully ensured plenty names to go round - and this one is named for labour organiser James Connelly (1868-1916). (updated Jun 2024)\n3 Heuston (St\u00e1isi\u00fan Heuston), St Johns Rd West, Dublin 8 (2 km west of city centre, on LUAS tram red line). Ticket office 7AM-9PM. This serves all directions except the north or the east coast. Trains run from Cork (2\u00bd hr), Galway (2\u00bd hr), Westport (3\u00bd hr), Limerick (2 hr 15 min) and Waterford (2 hr). There are connections from Ballina, from Tralee and Killarney, from Clonmel and Tipperary, and from Nenagh. Heuston has toilets, ATM, small shops, kiosks and cafes, plus supermarkets on the streets nearby. To reach the centre take the tram. The station is named for railway worker Se\u00e1n Heuston (1891-1916). (updated Jun 2024)\nAllow 45 min if you need to transfer between Heuston and Connolly.\n\n\nBy bus\n4 Bus\u00e1ras bus station is just south of Connolly railway station and 300 m east of O'Connell Street. It has Bus Eireann services from most towns in Ireland, such as Belfast (2 hr 30), Cork (4 hr), Limerick (3 hr 30), Galway (4 hr) and Donegal (2 hr 30), all running via the airport. Other operators are Kavanaghs from Limerick and Waterford, and Citylink and GoBus from Galway. Eurolines 871 runs on Saturday evening from London Victoria via Birmingham, Holyhead and the ferry to reach Dublin city centre early Sunday morning; the reverse run leaves Dublin Friday evening. The station has luggage lockers and pay-to-enter toilets in the basement.\nOther bus companies don't use this station but leave from stops in the nearby streets.\n\n\nBy boat\n\n5 Dublin Port has ferries from Holyhead in Wales (Stena and Irish Ferries, 3 hr 30 min), Bootle near Liverpool (P&O, 8 hrs and  Douglas, Isle of Man (Isle of Man Ferries, 3 hr 30 min). From Cherbourg in Normandy and  Pembroke in Wales they nowadays only sail to Rosslare and not to Dublin. \nThe port is 2 km east of the centre; the number 53 bus connects the port to the bus station by Custom House in central Dublin. The bus usually only accepts Leap Cards. or coins: occasionally a driver will accept payment by notes or cards, but this is the exception. There is no facility for buying Leap Cards at the port. Foot passengers opting to walk to or from the port should avoid Alexandra Road. The M50 tunnel (toll) allows motorists to disembark at Dublin and drive straight onto the motorway without getting snarled in city centre traffic.\nThe former ferry port of D\u00fan Laoghaire is no longer used.  Another ferry route is the short crossing from Cairnryan in Scotland to Belfast, then by road or rail to Dublin.\n\n\nBy car\nIf you're visiting just for a day trip, don't bring a car into the congested centre, use a Park & Ride. From the south, use either Sandyford Luas stop, just off junction 15 of M50 on Blackthorn Rd, or Bray DART stop on Bray Rd. From the west, use Red Cow Luas stop, off junction 9 of M50. From the north east, use Howth DART station. Park & Ride spaces cost \u20ac4 all day, though you've the tram or train fare to add on.\n\n\nGet around\n\nYou can see much of the city on foot.\n\n\nBy public transport\nPublic transport in Dublin consists of trains, trams and buses. Unlike many other European capitals, the rail network in Dublin is quite limited, so buses are by far the main mode of public transport. Public transport is not run by a single agency, but by a number of state-contracted operators, and most information is provided separately on each operator's website. Trains are run by Irish Rail and trams by Luas, while most buses are run by Dublin Bus, except some local buses in suburban areas which are run by Go-Ahead Ireland.\nTransport for Ireland (TFI) is the umbrella brand for public transport in Ireland, although its website primarily just directs you to the individual operators websites for information. However, the TFI Journey Planner is a good way to plan your journey across different modes, and the Live Departures provides real time information for all rail and bus stops. TFI also provides a number of smartphone apps including a journey planner and real time departures. Note that the journey planner app also provides real time departures, so you don't need to download both. The TFI Journey Planner and Live Departures are also integrated into Google Transit and are available within Google Maps.\n\n\nTickets and Leap Card\nOn trains and trams, tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines at the station or stop prior to boarding. Train tickets are valid for the day of purchase and are needed to get through the entry and exit turnstiles at stations. Tram tickets do not have to be validated prior to boarding, but must be used within 90 minutes of purchase. On buses, you can pay the fare to the driver when boarding, but you must have the exact amount in coins. Banknotes cannot be taken, and if you overpay in coins, no change is given.\nIf you plan to use public transport a lot, consider getting a TFI Leap Card, which you can top up with credit and use to pay fares on all public transport in the city, at a 30% discount. Leap Cards can be purchased from most convenience shops at just \u20ac5 for adults and \u20ac3 for children (this is actually not a charge but a deposit, and if you register your card online, it can later be refunded to an EU bank account or a number of charities). You can check your credit and top up the card at most convenience shops, at train or tram ticket vending machines, and on your phone with the Leap Top-Up App.\nTo use your Leap Card on trains or trams, you need to tag-on by holding your card against the turnstile or validator before boarding, and then tag-off again at the turnstile or validator at the end of your journey. You will automatically be charged the relevant fare between the tag-on and tag-off locations. To use your Leap Card on buses, you can place the card on the driver's machine, and tell the driver where you are going, and they will deduct the relevant fare. If you know that you are making a longer journey, you can instead hold your card against the other validator on the right hand side of the door, where you will automatically be charged the highest fare. Unlike trains and trams, you don't need to tag-off when you leave the bus. It's important to note that if you don't tag-on before travelling, you don't have a valid ticket, so you could be fined if a ticket inspector boards and checks your card.\nSingle fares are around 30% cheaper with a Leap Card than with cash. A 90-minute fare applies, meaning that after you tag onto any mode of transport, you can use the same Leap Card to tag onto any other Dublin regional buses, trams or trains within the next 90 minutes without extra cost. The fares are also capped, so once you reach a certain amount within the same day or week (Monday to Sunday), you can continue to travel for free for the remainder of that day or week. For adults, the daily caps are \u20ac5.60 for buses or trams, \u20ac7.60 for trains and \u20ac8 for all modes. The weekly caps are \u20ac22 for buses or trams, \u20ac29.60 for trains and \u20ac32 for all modes. Child caps are much lower, about one third of the adult caps.\nA special Leap Visitor Card is also available for tourists, which allows unlimited use of all public transport for 1 day (\u20ac8), 3 days (\u20ac16), or 7 days (\u20ac32), starting from the time of first use. This can be purchased at arrivals in Dublin Airport (WH Smith and Wrights in Terminal 1 and Spar in Terminal 2) in some city centre tourist offices, or ordered online for delivery. Once your chosen time period expires, you can also top it up with additional time periods at most convenience shops in the city.\n\n\nBy train\n\nInter-city, commuter and DART trains use the same track, but vary in the stops they make. For timetables, route maps and fares, see Irish Rail. \n\nDART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) is a suburban line along the coast, from Howth and Malahide in the north to  Bray and Greystones in the south, via Connolly and other city centre stations, D\u00fan Laoghaire and Dalkey. Trains run 6AM-11PM and the core section between Howth Junction and Bray has trains M-F every 10 min and Sa Su every 30 min. North of Howth Junction, alternate trains head either for Malahide or for Howth. South of Bray, every third train extends to Greystones. Change at Bray for inter-city trains to Wicklow, Wexford and Rosslare.\nCommuter trains fan out to towns within an hour or so of the city.\n- North from Connolly to Drogheda, along the coast via Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Rush, Skerries and Balbriggan. They're hourly, daily, and rush-hour trains extend to Dundalk. Change at Drogheda for Newry and Belfast.\n- West from Connolly to Maynooth via Drumcondra, Castleknock, Clonsilla and Leixlip. There's a branch line from Clonsilla to Dunboyne and M3 Parkway, which is the P&R for the Navan and Trim area. They're hourly, daily; change at Maynooth for Mullingar, Longford, Boyle and Sligo. Another branch line connects Grand Canal Dock with Connolly and Drumcondra.\n- Southwest from Heuston to Portlaoise via Park West & Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Adamstown, Hazelhatch & Celbridge, Sallins (for Naas), Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, and Portarlington. They're hourly M-Sa and every two hours on Sunday. The branch line from Grand Canal Dock also connects M-F via Connolly and Drumcondra, bypassing Heuston to join the route at Park West & Cherry Orchard as far as Hazelhatch & Celbridge.\nConnolly and Heuston are the principal stations, see Get in. Others that visitors might use are on the DART line south from Connolly:\n\n- Tara Street just south of the river for Temple Bar and Trinity College\n- Pearse for Merrion Square and the National Museums\n- Grand Canal Dock for southside dockland and the start of the canal\n- Lansdowne Road for the stadium\n- Sandymount for Ballsbridge\nFares: The short hop zone covers all DART and commuter rail services as far as Balbriggan, Kilcock, Sallins and Kilcoole. As of 2021, a standard single is \u20ac2.25-6.20 adult and \u20ac1.25-2.55 child. Paying by TFI Leap Card it's \u20ac1.70-4.90 adult and \u20ac0.80-1.94 child. Day return, 1 day, 3 day, 7 day and monthly tickets are also available. A family all day ticket is \u20ac20, for up to 2 adults and 4 children; it's rail-only and doesn't include tram or bus. (See Rail travel in Ireland for other ticket deals, some of which are thoroughly bad value.) Your ticket is valid for any train so if you were at Bray waiting for the Dart service back to city centre, and the inter-city from Rosslare happened to pull in, you could hop aboard. \n\n\nBy tram\n\nLuas, Irish for \"speed\", is Dublin's tram system. Trams are modern and reliable, and run frequently from 6AM to midnight. There are two lines:\n\nRed line is east-west, from The Point in dockland and Connolly Station to Bus\u00e1ras, Abbey Street, Heuston Station, St James's Hospital, Red Cow P&R then either Tallaght P&R or Cheeverstown P&R and Saggart in the southwest of the city.\nGreen line is north-south, from Broombridge to TU Dublin Grangegorman Campus, Marlborough St southbound / O'Connell St northbound, Trinity College, St Stephen's Green, Dundrum, P&Rs at Balally, Stillorgan and Sandyford, Leopardstown, Carrickmines P&R and Brides Glen in the southeast of the city.\nThe lines cross in north city centre, with a 100-m walk from the Abbey Street stop on the Red line to the Green lines north or south, a block apart at that point. \nYou must buy your ticket before boarding: there are machines by all the stops. Visitors are only likely to use the outer sections for the Park & Rides. For the city centre zone, e.g. between Heuston and Connolly, in 2024 it's \u20ac1.70 adult standard and \u20ac1.30 by Leap Card. Day return, 1 day and 7 day tickets are available.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n\nCity network\nAn extensive network of 150 bus routes serves most parts of the city and its surrounding suburbs. Most buses in the city centre pass through the O'Connell St area (including Mountjoy and Parnell Squares, Eden Quay and Fleet St) and the Trinity College area (including Pearse St, Nassau St, Dame St and College Green). Services vary from high frequency routes running every few minutes all day, to lower frequency routes running every hour or less, to peak-only limited-stop \"Xpresso\" routes and weekend-only late night \"Nitelink\" routes.\nConfusingly, the bus network in Dublin is run by two separate companies, with timetables listed on two separate websites, and displayed at stops in two different formats. However, both companies share the same fare structure and Leap ticketing system, and all routes are included in the Transport for Ireland Journey Planner and Real Time apps:\n\nDublin Bus operate all cross-city routes, and all routes which run to and from the city centre. The timetables displayed at stops refer to the time the bus leaves the terminus, not the time it will be passing that particular stop, so there is a bit of guesswork required.\nGo-Ahead Ireland operate local routes in the suburbs, as well as orbital routes which avoid the city centre. In contrast to Dublin Bus, all Go-Ahead Ireland timetables displayed at stops refer to the times buses are due to be passing that particular stop.\nA detailed map of the entire city network, colour coded by frequency is available here (and for the far outer areas see here).\nCash fares within the city (exact amount in coins only) are \u20ac2.15-3.80 adult and \u20ac1.00-1.60 child, while if paying with a TFI Leap Card are \u20ac1.55-3.00 adult and \u20ac0.80-1.26 child. Those paying with a TFI Leap Card can also benefit from a \u20ac1 discount if interchanging within 90 minutes, and maximum daily and weekly caps. See Tickets and Leap Card.\nAt busier stops, an electronic sign lists the next 4 to 6 real-time departures. For all other stops, real-time departures can be checked online or in TFI apps (see By public transport above). All buses display their route number and destination on the front. When you see your bus approaching, hold out your hand to signal to the driver that you want to get on, otherwise they may not stop. If you have a prepaid TFI Leap Card, enter on the right-hand side and tag on by holding your card against the reader. Otherwise enter on the left-hand side to pay the driver.\nInside the bus, small screens display the next stop in both Irish and English, along with an audio announcement in both languages. When you see or hear your stop being announced, press one of the red buttons to signal to the driver that you want to get off.\n\n\nPrincipal routes\n\nCross-city buses are operated by Dublin Bus and ply every 10 minutes M-Sa and 20-30 min on Sundays:\n\nBus 4 from Harristown and Ballymun in the north to Ballsbridge and Blackrock in the southeast.\nBus 15 from Clongriffin and Artane in the northeast to Templeogue and Ballycullen in the southwest. It runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 16 from Dublin Airport and Santry in the north to Rathfarnham and Ballinteer in the south.\nBus 27 from Clare Hall and Artane in the northeast to Walkinstown and Tallaght in the southwest.\nBus 39a from Ongar and Blanchardstown in the northwest to Baggot Street and University College Dublin in the southeast. It runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 40 from Charlestown and Finglas in the northwest to Ballyfermot and Liffey Valley in the west.\nBus 41 / 41c operate from Swords, Santry and Drumcondra in the north to Abbey Street in the city centre, with alternate buses (route 41) serving Dublin Airport - this runs 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus 46a from Phoenix Park northwest to University College Dublin, Stillorgan and D\u00fan Laoghaire southeast.\nBus 130 from Abbey Street in city centre to Clontarf, Bull Island and St Annes Park to the northeast.\nBus 145 from Heuston Station in the inner west to University College Dublin, Stillorgan and Bray in the southeast.\nBus C1 / C2 from Adamstown and Lucan to Heuston station, the Quays, Ballsbridge and Sandymount. Together they run 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nBus G1 / G2 from Spencer Dock to St James Hospital Ballyfermot then either Red Cow tram terminal or Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. Together they run 24 hours, every 30 min overnight.\nSeveral orbital routes skirt the city centre, run by Go Ahead, usually daily every 20-30 min: \n\nBus 17 runs south, from Rialto via Terenure, Rathfarnham and University College Dublin to Blackrock.\nBus 17a runs north, from Blanchardstown via Finglas, Ballymun, Santry and Coolock to Kilbarrack.\nBus 18 crosses the inner south, from Palmerstown via Ballyfermot, Kylemore, Crumlin, Rathmines, Ranelagh and Ballsbridge to Sandymount.\nBus 75 crosses the outer south, from Tallaght via Rathfarnham, Ballinteer, Dundrum and Stillorgan to D\u00fan Laoghaire.\nBus 175 takes the same route to Dundrum then heads to University College Dublin.\nBus 76 crosses the west, from Tallaght via Clondalkin, Liffey Valley and Ballyfermot to Chapelizod, with a few extending to Blanchardstown.\nAt night: in summary the 24-hour bus routes are 41 (the only night bus from the airport), 15, 39a, C1 / C2 and G1 / G2. You pay the normal daytime fare for these. \nNitelink buses are extras from midnight Friday and Saturday to 4AM, on 15 routes radiating from D'Olier Street, Westmoreland Street and Aston Quay. They run every hour or two, for instance to Portmarnock, Howth, Balbriggan, Bray and Greystones. You pay a little more for these. Their service is outbound-only then they return to the city empty, so drunks and wastrels can't use them as an overnight doss. As if, in Dublin?\nSee also individual towns for their overnight services from the city.\n\n\nBy bike\n\nHiring a bicycle is a handy way to get around if you want to get outside the very centre of the city and are comfortable cycling in traffic. That being said, the city is not very bicycle-friendly, either in terms of quantity & quality of bike paths, pedestrians and drivers honouring the bike paths, road space available where there is no bike path (i.e. numerous narrow roads), or driver attitudes in general.\nWhen cycling in the city centre, be aware that cycle lanes, where they exist, are generally shared with buses, taxis, motorcycles, and parked cars; cyclists should pay particular attention when approaching bus stops where a bus is pulling out. Motorbikes are not allowed to use the cycle lanes, but many still do so. Passing on the left is also allowed only in limited circumstances but is in fact still common. When cycling in Phoenix Park,  while there is a dedicated cycle lane on both sides of the main thoroughfare unfortunately pedestrians also use these.\nThere are bikes to hire in several locations around the city centre with the Dublinbikes scheme. A 3-day pass (which is the only pass available to non-residents) costs \u20ac5 and gives you access to the bikes. They are free for the first 30min, up to 1h rentals cost \u20ac0.50 and up to 2 hours cost \u20ac1.50, so it is a good idea to return the bikes frequently. You can purchase the 3-day pass only at stations which accept credit cards, but once purchased you can use it to rent bikes at any station. Your credit card will be preauthorized with a security deposit of \u20ac150, which will be charged in case of theft or if the bike was not returned within 24 hours. Among others, there is a Dublinbikes bike hire place located at the entrance to the Phoenix Park, Dublin 8.\n\n\nBy car\nDon't drive if you can realistically avoid it. For instance, if you plan to see Dublin before touring the country, take the bus in from the airport and return there a few days later to hire your car. For a day-trip, use the city edge Park & Rides. If you do venture in, you face traffic congestion (even on Sunday), difficulty parking, confusing one-ways or diversions for road repairs, traffic congestion, drunken revellers and phone-entranced jaywalkers veering into your path, ill-signed but rigidly enforced bus lanes, the silent onrush of trams, and traffic congestion, traffic, traffic....\nOn-street meter parking is in short supply and only for brief periods, and if you over-stay you're likely to be clamped or towed, for a penalty in excess of \u20ac100. For a visit say to a museum you need to seek out a multi-storey car park \u2014 plan ahead for those you might use. Check also what the deal is with your accommodation; a central place may not have its own parking.\nDublin's outer road is M50, which starts from the port downtown and tunnels beneath the north city (toll) to the airport perimeter, where M1 continues north towards Belfast while M50 arcs round the western city with access to all arterial routes. There's another toll between Junctions 6 (N3 Blanchardstown) and 7 (N4 Lucan). Tolls are about \u20ac3, but in rush hour the tunnel is \u20ac10. There are no cash booths, you must pay online either in advance or by 8PM next day, else there's a penalty (to which your hire company and credit card will gleefully add). Hire cars may come with an e-tag.  \nThe Outer Orbital Route, or M45, is a proposed bypass further out, arcing round from Drogheda to Navan, Enfield and Newbridge. The government keeps confirming this plan but nothing has happened; it would carve through important sites such as Hill of Tara. Meanwhile the same name is also used for the Outer and Inner orbital routes within the M50 semicircle. These are just existing streets interconnecting between the radial roads, confusingly signed and with much zigzagging.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis in Ireland can be identified by the yellow plate on the roof. Have nothing to with unofficial taxis.  \nFares are nationally regulated so you pay the same stuck in traffic trying to reach the airport as you do up a back lane in Connemara. Taxis are required to use the meter, to accept credit and debit cards as well as cash, and not to surcharge any card. However it's \u20ac3 extra for booking instead of hailing on the street or using a taxi rank, and phone apps may impose a further charge. Fares are revised every two years so from Dec 2024 you pay:\n\nStandard rate (M-Sa 8AM-8PM): Flagfall (then 500 m or 85 sec) \u20ac4.40; then Tariff A (next 15 km or 43 min) \u20ac1.32 / km or \u20ac0.47 / minutes to max \u20ac23.60; then Tariff B \u20ac1.72 / km or \u20ac0.61 / min.\nPremium rate (M-Sa 8PM-8AM, all day Sunday and most public holidays): Flagfall \u20ac5.40, Tariff A \u20ac1.81 / km or \u20ac0.64 / minutes to max \u20ac31.80; then Tariff B \u20ac2.20 / km or \u20ac0.78 / min.\nSpecial rate (Sa Su midnight-4AM, 24 Dec 8PM through Christmas to 8AM 26 Dec, 31 Dec 8PM to 8AM 1 Jan): same as Premium rate but after flagfall you go straight to Tariff B, there's no Tariff A.\n\n\nSee\n\nDublin's top attractions sell out in summer. Buy tickets online in advance if you know you want to see something, especially for the Book of Kells where even early arrivals may find all the day's slots are filled.\nThe Dublin Pass gives you free and fast track entry to thirty-some attractions in Dublin. Adult prices in 2024 are \u20ac79 for one day, \u20ac109 for two, \u20ac129 for three, \u20ac154 for four and \u20ac164 for five, child prices about half, and days must run consecutively. You'll struggle to break even on this deal as only the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour and the Jameson Distillery and Guinness tours charge over \u20ac25; most are way cheaper. The Pass doesn't include the National Museum sites (free anyhow), the Library and Book of Kells at Trinity College, or any public transport.\n\n\nNorth of the river\n1 GPO Museum, O'Connell St Lower D01 F5P2, \u260f +353 1 872 1916. M-Sa 10AM-5PM. The GPO is the headquarters of the Post Office in Ireland, built in Neo-Classical style 1814-1818. In 1916 it was occupied by Irish rebels led by PH Pearse, who read the Proclamation of the Republic outside the front door of the building. The interior was burnt out by shelling from government forces against the rebels, but the exterior survived. Subsequently the GPO was restored, reopening in 1929, and remains a busy working post office. The museum within it is a multimedia exploration of the Easter Rising. Adult \u20ac17, conc \u20ac15, child \u20ac8.50.   (updated Jun 2024)\nO'Connell Street is the broad thoroughfare running north from the river, and the main district for budget accommodation. It was smashed up in the 1916 uprising and subsequent civil war, but rebuilt; then in the 1970s the developers made one sorry mess of it. And their assistants: All along O'Connell Street the pieces flew, up went Nelson, and the pillar too... was the ditty commemorating the 1966 IRA bombing of Nelson's Column. Where it stood, next to the GPO, is now the 121-m pin of the Spire of Dublin; close by on North Earl St is the James Joyce Statue. Northbound trams glide up the street: go a block east for the southbound track. The city council are doing their best to further improve the place but it's a work in progress: pleasant enough by day, but tacky by night.\n2 St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, 83 Marlborough Place D01 DX9, \u260f +353 1 874 5441. Daily 9AM-5PM. Dublin's Catholic cathedral, built in 1825. Catholicism was always the majority religion in Ireland, but its practice was forbidden until the 19th century. The official cathedral is Christ Church, so designated by the Pope in 1300, but taken over by the Protestants in the 16th century. When the laws relaxed, St Mary's was built in neo-Classical style as a temporary or \"pro\"-cathedral, until such time as the Pope decrees otherwise or the Protestants hand back Christ Church. Neither event appears imminent.   (updated Jun 2024)\n National Leprechaun Museum, 2 Mary's Abbey D07 X6R6 (Tram to Jervis), \u260f +353 1 873 3899. Su-Th 10AM-6:30PM, F Sa 10AM-8PM. The \"little folk\" appeared in lore around 1300 AD but only flourished from the 19th century Celtic revival, dressed in late Georgian garb in an idealised rural past, mending a shoe. They proliferated into the silliest of 20th century Irish tourism, like greenfly upon the Rose of Tralee, and fell out of fashion. This museum is immersive telling of the stories woven around them, with a daytime and darker night show. Day show adult \u20ac18, conce \u20ac16, child \u20ac11.

Tu-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-5PM. Sir Hugh Lane (1875-1915) was one of the first collectors of modern art. He died in the sinking of Lusitania and this public gallery reflects his Will, which involved about as much negotiation, fudge and compromise as the Treaty for Irish independence. The permanent exhibitions are mostly contemporary Irish artists, plus Francis Bacon's studio, relocated from London in 2001. Charlemont House was built in 1763 and in 1929 its gardens were built over to create the gallery, which is wheelchair accessible. Free.   (updated Jun 2024)\nGarden of Remembrance across the street from the gallery and museum commemorates those who died in the struggle for Irish independence.

He never lived here himself. (updated Jun 2024)\nSaint Saviour is a confident neo-Gothic church on Dominick St Lower, west of the Rotunda. Built in 1853, it's the Priory of the Dominican order, who also worship at St Martin's Chapel on Parnell Square.\n\n4 Ha'penny Bridge is the one on all the picture postcards and film locations, a 43 m cast-iron arch spanning the river between Liffey St Lower and Wellington Quay. Officially called the \"Liffey Bridge\" (Droichead na Life), it was built in 1816 to replace the cross-river ferries, with the right to charge a ha'penny toll for the next century. There were turnstiles at both ends, removed in 1919 after the toll ceased. The bridge was extensively repaired in 2001. Please don't clutter it up with \"love-locks\" - the last big clean-up removed 300 kg of these, and bear in mind that those repairs were by Harland and Wolff, builders of the Titanic.\nDownstream from O'Connell Bridge the river broadens into dockland and the open sea, with poignant reminders of the Irish people's relationship with that sea.\n5 The Famine Memorial on Custom House Quay depicts victims of the Great Famine (an Gorta M\u00f3r) of 1845-49, when a million died and another million fled the country. Five gaunt figures totter to the docks with their bundles as if to take ship and leave. Or perhaps they hope for scraps from those ships, which during the famine years were briskly exporting food for profit, plenty to feed everyone yet unaffordable to most.\n6 EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, CHQ, Custom House Quay D01 R9Y0 (Tram to George\u2019s Dock), \u260f +353 1 906 0861.

Adult \u20ac15, child \u20ac10.  (updated Jun 2024)\n7 Samuel Beckett Bridge , designed by Santiago Calatrava, is a harp-shaped cable-stay road bridge of 120 m. It spans the river between North Wall Quay (in Docklands, north bank) and Sir John Rogerson's Quay (near Grand Canal Square, south bank) and the whole contraption hinges through 90 degrees to let ships pass. Daytime it's busy with traffic and is most scenic when floodlit at night. Calatrava also designed the James Joyce bridge upstream.\n8 Green on Red Gallery, Park Lane, Spencer Dock D01 Y821, \u260f +353 87 245 4282, info@greenonredgallery.com. M-F 10AM-6PM.

Built in the 1740s, its first occupant was Lord Viscount Molesworth and his family, and after him came a series of Right Honorable This and Viscount That and Bishop of Wherever. But the union with England in 1801 drained power and money to London, and the neighbourhood went downhill. Rural folk flocked to Dublin after the famine, so the building was broken up into tenements, with 100 living here. From the 1930s the inner city drained out to new suburbs, and No 14 fell derelict in 1970 before being preserved. Visit by guided tour. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac8, child \u20ac6. (updated Jun 2024)\nRoyal Canal loops around the north city and is navigable to the Shannon.\n\n\nSouth of the river\n\nMost of Dublin's top sights are a short way south of the river, notably Trinity College, the National Museum archaeology collections, the National Gallery, and the elegant Georgian town through Merrion Square to St Stephen's Green.\n11 Trinity College, College Green, Dublin 2, \u260f +353 1 896 2320, bookofkells@tcd.ie. Kells: May-Sep M-Sa 8:30AM-7PM, Su 9:30AM-5PM; Oct-Apr M-Sa 9:30AM-5PM, Su noon-4:30PM. Trinity College is the fine Georgian campus of the University of Dublin. It's generally open to stroll around in daylight hours, but it is a working university, and most interiors are off-limits to tourists. You can visit the Chapel near the front (west) gate of the College. But the big attraction is the Old Library and Book of Kells. Book online, otherwise buy your ticket from the machines under the Lecky library just south. This is for a timed slot, and at weekends may be booked out. You enter an exhibition hall setting the Book in the context of other monastic writings of its period, circa 800 AD. Next enter the display area: only two pages are displayed at any time, one being richly illustrated with little text (or no text, on the \"carpet\" pages), and one page being text of the Vulgate Gospels, written in Insular Majuscule Latin. But it's difficult to enjoy, with crowds jostling round the display case. Next, go upstairs into the massive Long Hall of the library, with books and ladders and more books and ladders towering away upwards. Last but not least, exit through the gift shop, which can be entered without a ticket. Adults \u20ac25, conc \u20ac20, child \u20ac15.

Irish distilleries have for too long pumped out bland commercial fare, though the country has all the ingredients and know-how to produce whiskey of character to rival single-malt Scotch. Standard tour \u20ac20. (updated Jun 2024)\nTemple Bar is the district just west of the College along the riverside, with wall-to-wall pubs and eating places.

She's entirely fictional, though Dublin had many such street-hawkers, and she's not to be confused with Mary Mallon of Cookstown, the all-too-real \"Typhoid Mary\". Her kitsch statue dates to 1988 and was installed on nearby Grafton Street, but moved to its present spot in 2014 to make way for tram tracks. She's often mocked as \"The Tart with the Cart\" or \"The Trollop with the Scallop\" and her breasts (above an unhistorical low-cut dress) have been well polished by passing hands. Alas amidst these misogynist tropes and gropes, we forget the sad fate of the cockles and mussels themselves.\n13 National Gallery of Ireland, Merrion Square West D02 K303 (another entrance on Clare St), \u260f +353 1 661 5133. Tu W F Sa 9:15AM-5:30PM, Th 9:15AM-8:30PM, Su M 11AM-5:30PM. Impressive national collection of Irish and European Art.

Amazing display of Ireland's artefacts from prehistory through the Viking era to independence. The standout is the Treasury (with the 12th century Ardagh Chalice and 9th century Tara Brooch), and the prehistoric jewellery: gold and silver beautifully worked and carved - then chucked into the bog?? And likewise into the bog went bodies, presumably of defeated foes and heinous criminals given the violence of their deaths. Normally when a body is buried, the flesh decays and a skeleton persists. But if you throw a body into a peat bog, the acid dissolves the bones while tannin preserves the hide. The person turns into a handbag. Free.   (updated Jun 2024)\n Leinster House, Kildare Street D02 TK75, \u260f +353 1 618 3000. This opulent Georgian mansion is in the same block as the Archaeology Museum. Designed by Cassels, it was built in 1745 as the residence of the Duke of Leinster at a time when the southside was unfashionable. It proved an \"anchor development\" and Dublin's centre of power and culture soon gravitated from the northside. From 1922 it became the temporary base of the Oireachtas, the Irish bi-cameral parliament, and like the Ulster border it remains temporary over a century later. Tours are only available if you're sponsored by a TD or senator.  (updated Jun 2024)\n15 National Museum of Ireland - Natural History, Merrion St Upper D02 F27, \u260f +353 1 677 7444.

(updated Jun 2024)\n \n16 Merrion Square  is a large stately square filled with grassy and shady areas and surrounded by Georgian red-brick houses. At the northwest corner is a life-sized statue of the writer and dramatist Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900), who grew up at No. 1 here. He's depicted sprawled on the embankment, with a lop-sided smirk, as if totally wasted. (As if! And him with the hollowest legs in London!) Two short marble columns are covered in his quotable quotes. On the surrounding buildings, plaques commemorate other notable residents, such as the Duke of Wellington. The fine architecture continues south, along Mount Street Upper and Fitzwilliam Street Lower.\n17 St Stephens Green  is a pleasant Victorian public park, open in daylight hours. The Fusiliers' Arch was erected in 1907 to commemorate the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who fell in the Second Boer War (1899-1902).\nMoLI the Museum of Literature Ireland is south side of St Stephens, open daily 10:30AM-5:30PM, adult \u20ac14.50, conc or child \u20ac12.\n18 Little Museum of Dublin, 33 Pembroke St Lower D02 FK06, \u260f +353 1 661 1000.

Donation. (updated Jun 2024)\nThe Grand Canal marks the southern boundary of the inner city; the Royal Canal similarly loops across the northern city. Both were built in the 18th and 19th century to carry passengers and freight between Dublin and the Shannon and Atlantic. The Grand Canal took 47 years to construct: the expense of crossing the Bog of Allen replicated the prehistoric custom of sinking gold into bogs. And indeed Irish waterways go that far back, as the earliest dwellers could barely get about by land. Waterways Ireland website gives information eg on walks, navigability and fishing on this and the other canals.\n\n\nWest city\nThe original Dublin was in this area, at the confluence of the Poddle (now culverted) and the Liffey.

Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (1875-1968) was an American mining magnate who amassed a fabulous collection of early books and manuscripts and oriental art. He moved to London and collaborated generously with the British Museum, but in 1950 there was a falling-out and he moved to Ireland.

So this is the oldest building in Dublin, though it underwent a massive restoration in the 1870s. It became Protestant under Henty VIII, apart from a brief Roman Catholic interlude in 1690 when the exiled James II was campaigning in Ireland, and the Vatican still claims it. The oldest part is the large crypt, where amongst the items on display are a mummified cat and rat, which got themselves stuck in the church organ in the 19th century.

Founded in 1191, it became Anglican at the Reformation, so the Protestants had two cathedrals in the same city while the Catholics had none. It feuded with Christ Church over rights and precedence, until 1871 when Christ Church was nominated the senior church for Dublin and Glendalough and St Patrick's for the rest of Ireland. Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, was dean of St Patrick's from 1713 to 1745 and is buried here, as is his lady friend Stella Johnson. It was rebuilt in the 1860s into a confident pile of Victoriana, and anything that looks medieval is probably a 19th century concoction. Adult \u20ac10, conc \u20ac9.

It's best known for Donnybrook Fair, founded in 1204 and lasting until 1855 by which time it was a byword for drunkenness, fighting and hasty marriages. Yes, the bus will do for this area, the 46a.\nRanelagh and Dartry are also worth a look. Ranelagh is small but affluent, reached by the Luas Green line and with several well-regarded eateries.\nSandymount, a coastal suburb 3 km southeast of the centre, is an affluent area that was the birthplace of WB Yeats, and features prominently in James Joyce's Ulysses. There is a grand walk from Sandymount across the north end of its beach to the South Bull Wall which reaches a finger well out into the Bay.\n29  University College Dublin (UCD)  is now a \"city-within-a-city\" on Belfield Campus.\n30 Rathfarnham Castle, Rathfarnham Rd D14 KT36, \u260f +353 1 493 9462.

Patrick Pearse (1879-1916) saw Irish culture and language as essential for national independence. His one and only case as a barrister was his unsuccessful defence of a Donegal tradesman for using an \"illegible\" sign, and the verdict effectively made Irish signage illegal. He set up a language school in 1908, which moved here in 1910. He was also a leading Republican, reading the proclamation of independence on the GPO steps in the Easter Rising of 1916. He was court-martialled and shot nine days later. Free. (updated Jun 2024)\n\n\nNorth suburbs\n\nDrumcondra is a relatively affluent Victorian suburb along the valley of the River Tolka (An Tulcha, \"the flood\", as property owners know to their cost). The Royal Canal bounds it to the south: this has a good towpath and is navigable all the way to the Shannon. (Remarkably, its backers lost even more money than those of the Grand Canal.) On its east side is Croke Park, the centrepoint of Gaelic sports. To the west it runs into Glasnevin, which has the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin Cemetery and good restaurants. Many bus routes come this way, and commuter trains towards  Maynooth stop at Drumcondra.\n32 Glasnevin Cemetery (Reilig Ghlas Na\u00edon), Finglas Rd D11 XA32 (Buses 9, 13, 40 from O'Connell St or 40a/40d from Parnell St), \u260f +353 1 882 6500. Daily 9AM-5PM. This opened as an RC cemetery in 1832, in an era when the Catholics weren't allowed their own parish churches, and their burials were begrudged affairs in Protestant ground. Glasnevin has grown and grown, expanding south across Finglas road into the St Paul's section, but the famous names are north side. You can visit the cemetery free, but to make sense of it go to the visitor centre (daily 10AM-5PM, closed M Tu in winter). Walking tours visit the graves of Daniel O'Connell, Charles Stewart Parnell, Michael Collins, Eamonn De Valera and many others of historic or architectural interest. A back gate connects to the Botanic Gardens. Tour adult \u20ac14, conc or child \u20ac12.

The gardens also manage the arboretum at Kilmacurragh near Wicklow Town. Free.   (updated Jun 2024)\nClontarf is a suburb on the north shore of the Tolka estuary. Here on 23 April 1014 was the battle at which Brian Boru defeated Leinster and their Viking allies but was killed himself. Clontarf has a 4.5-km promenade, traversed by Buses 104, 130 and 32X from the city, so it's a popular seaside outing. (Don't take the train, which runs inland.) St Anne's Park was the estate of the Guinness family home, and has ponds, follies, walks and a Rose Garden. Clontarf Island has disappeared beneath the waves, but in 2004 archaeologists were astounded by a Moai or Easter Island statue that now stands near the pier, until they read in the newspapers that it was a replica gifted by the government of Chile.\n34 Bull Island  is reached by two causeways. The South Bull and North Bull were sandbanks, and a confounded nuisance for navigation into Dublin; works to clear them began in the 18th century but the sea always won. In the 19th century a wall was built that funneled the estuary outflow, scouring the channel so the South Bull washed away while the North Bull grew into the present island. So it's not short of sand, and the 5 km Dollymount Strand is Dublin's best beach. The southern half of the island is a birdlife reserve and the north is St Anne's golf course. The south causeway from Clontarf, the \"Wooden Bridge\", was built in 1819 as a temporary access while the wall was built, but they decided to keep it: it's a single lane, traffic-light controlled. Causeway Road is the broader highway to mid-island.\n\n\nDo\n \nSo Padraig comes for a job in construction, and the hiring boss says \"So can you tell me, what's the difference between a joist and a girder?\"\n\"Sure, everyone knows that.

Su-Th 9:30AM-5PM, F Sa 9:30AM-6PM. Guinness is brewed in 49 countries and Ireland just happens to be one of them. The St James Gate brewery is still in production, now part of Diageo, and this vast storehouse has become an exhibition (self-guided) on the drink and the Guinness family. Price of entry includes a pint at the seventh floor Gravity Bar, which forms the head of the giant pint of stout formed by the atrium. Outside, touristy-trappy horse-drawn carriages ply for hire, but a stretch limo for the 2 km ride back to city centre might be cheaper. Adult \u20ac26, child \u20ac10.

Dublin city is famous for its characters. A great way to experience and live the city is by learning about it from people who are characters themselves - Dublin Tour Guides. Tours can vary from one to four hours in length and include, as well as the standard sightseeing tour, tours on topics like the paranormal and ghosts, music and song, literature, historical, 1916 Rising, and even Irish mythology. There are various walking tour companies and freelance tour guides available in Dublin. Anyone interested in geeky history should try the Ingenious Dublin tours, that cover history of medicine, Irish inventions (yes, there are lots!), great Irish scientists (lots of those too). They have walking tours and self-guided MP3 tours. \n Dublin Literary Pub Crawl, 'The Duke Pub', 9 Duke St, Dublin 2 (Just off Grafton St). 2. This is the most ingenious crash course in Irish literature, history, architecture and pub bonhomie yet devised... It combines street theatre with the 'craic' that makes Dublin pubs the liveliest in Europe. It is a highly enjoyable evening that gives you the pleasant notion of replacing brain cells as you drown them. The tour is a kind of rough guide to the cultural, religious and political life of the city. Performances by professional actors are central to the experience, not forgetting a fun-filled quiz with prizes for the winners. Can be a bit formal at times but this one's been going a long time and is well worth the experience for such an unusual tour. There's just enough time to stop in each pub for a pint as well. \u20ac10-12. \n\n\nPerforming Arts\n4NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Abbey Theatre (National Theatre of Ireland), 26/27 Lower Abbey St D01 K0F1, \u260f +353 1 878 7222.

Pubs are generally open Su-Th to 23:00 and F Sa to 01:00 or later. Hours were curtailed during covid, the plus (which will likely remain) was that pubs increased their food offering, which meant they were \"restaurants\" and permitted to stay open - \"You must try our pizza!\" became a legally enforceable invitation. Smoking is illegal within all Irish pubs but many have a beer garden or similar outdoor smoking area.\nTemple Bar was named for the sand bar and mud flats along the south bank of the Liffey, reclaimed for building in the 17th century. \"Temple\" was both the name of the landowners, and of the Temple Bar district in London, with Essex St and Fleet St in the same respective positions. It's nowadays a tourist strip of cobbled alleys, drinking places, restaurants, more drinking places, shops, even more drinking places . . . it's very central so those stag and hen parties are probably just in for a quick one before heading to the Book of Kells or the big museums. Take care, but the sheer number of people on the streets gives you a measure of safety. \n\n\nTraditional Irish\n Peadar Kearney's, 64 Dame St D02 RT72 (Temple Bar), \u260f +353 1 670 6457.

(updated Jun 2024)\n\n\nStay safe\nDublin is a safe city by day, but keep your wits about you, especially as night draws on. The emergency number for all services is 999 or 112.\nTraffic: the city is congested, avoid bringing a car yourself, and never leave valuables on display in a car.\nMotorists often ignore pedestrian crossing lights. Maybe they're preoccupied with searching for a parking spot.\nStreet life: Buskers, drunks and down-and-outs are all part of the picaresque Dublin scene, and An B\u00e9al Bocht - \"the poor mouth\" - has a noble literary tradition. A polite \"sorry\" should see them off.\nGarda\u00ed (police officers) are happy to assist or give directions. If you fear for your safety and can't find or phone a Garda, head to the nearest shop, bar etc where you will be safe and can call. Pub doormen and bouncers will likewise call the police for you, they want to forestall trouble on their street.\nLGBTQ+ travellers: Dublin is usually not only safe but welcoming, however 2022 saw a 29% increase nationwide in hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people. Each Garda station has a Diversity Officer on duty, and the police are vigilant against all forms of hate crime. Support can also be obtained from Outhouse LGBTQ+ Centre on Capel Street, tel +353 1 873 4999.\nRough areas: Boardwalk, Lower Abbey Street and around Connolly station are tacky rather than unsafe by day, worth a swerve at night.\nYou have simply no reason to be in down-at-heel outlying districts such as Ballymun.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nMedical\nYou should only go to the hospital if you're too ill to get there, so to speak. For immediate treatment of minor ailments try one of the Walk-in Medical Centres. The most central are Dame Street Medical at 16 Dame St in Temple Bar, Abbey Street Centre at 71 Middle Abbey St, and 24Doc at North Wall behind the Customs House. They're private so an EHIC / GHIC card won't help. Expect to pay \u20ac60 for a consultation, plus the cost of any prescription or other treatment.\n\n\nEmbassies\n  Argentina, 15 Ailesbury Drive, Ballsbridge D04 KF50, \u260f +353 1 269 1546.

These have free wifi and internet access, but you need to register as a user to access. This may be possible for non-residents with extended stays.\n\n\nGo next\n\nAlmost all of Ireland is within 2-3 hours travel from Dublin, and the transport routes converge on the city. People even make day-trips to the Aran Islands out west or Giant's Causeway in the north, a mad way to experience them. Those listed here are all within an hour of the city. \n\nCounty Dublin:\n- Dun Laoghaire is the city's former harbour, and Dalkey is a prosperous seaside suburb with Riveria architecture.\n- Howth is a scenic peninsula. Boat trips sail to Ireland's Eye, teeming with bird life.\n- Malahide has a fine castle. A walk along the coast brings you to Portmarnock beach.\nCounty Meath:\n- Br\u00fa Na B\u00f3inne Archaeological Park has the megalithic tombs of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth.\nCounty Wicklow:\n- Enniskerry has the gardens of Powerscourt and the highest waterfall in Ireland.\n- Glendalough is a remarkable monastic village in a scenic mountain valley.",
