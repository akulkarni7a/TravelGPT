  "extract": "Wales (Welsh: Cymru) is one of the United Kingdom's four constituent countries. With a distinctive Celtic language and culture, there's plenty to see and do in this beautiful country. \nMost tourists in Wales come from other parts of the UK, attracted to the scenic mountains, impressive coasts, magnificent national parks, imposing castles, and the fact that the country has much of Britain's industrial heritage. \nVisit Wales is the tourist bureau. \n\n\nRegions\nWales is here divided geographically and culturally into three regions:\n\n\nCities and towns\nThose most notable towns and cities are listed below:\n\n\nCities\n1 Cardiff (Welsh: Caerdydd) \u2014 the capital of Wales, the seat of the Welsh government, and a major tourist destination.\n2 Bangor \u2014  A small, picturesque university city with about 18,000 residents. Home to landmarks such as Bangor Cathedral and Garth Pier, the second-longest pier in Wales.\n3 Swansea (Abertawe) \u2014 Wales' second largest city is famous for is beaches and coastal walks. It is the gateway to the stunning Gower Peninsular.\n4 Wrexham (Wrecsam) \u2014 The largest town in North Wales was made a city in 2022.\n\n\nTowns\n5 Aberystwyth \u2014 A coastal town with large student population.\n6 Caernarfon \u2014 The site of Caernarfon Castle, one of Wales' largest and best preserved castles.\n7 Conwy \u2014 A medieval, fortified town with impressive castle and quaint shops.\n8 Hay-on-Wye (Y Gelli Gandryll) \u2014 The \"book capital\" of the UK, home to the annual literary festival.\n9 Tenby (Dinbych-y-pysgod) \u2014 A medieval walled town and elegant seaside resort.\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n) \u2013 large island, home to the town with the UK's longest placename\n2 Brecon Beacons National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog) - a range of low mountains, with mining history, market towns, caves, and waterfalls\n3 Gower Peninsula (Penrhyn G\u0175yr) - Wales's most beautiful beaches offer surfing and riding, while the peninsula's villages are picturesque\n4 Ll\u0177n (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) - a bastion of the Welsh language thrusting into the Irish Sea\n5 Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (Parc Cenedlaethol Arfordir Penfro) - rugged cliffs and peaceful coves, home to internationally-important seabird colonies\n6 Snowdonia National Park  (Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri) \u2013 popular mountaineering destination, with its pinnacle Mount Snowdon being the highest point in southern Britain\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nWales was once an independent, though rarely unified nation, with a strong Celtic and Druidical tradition. The word \"Wales\" is an exonym going back to a Germanic term meaning \"foreign\" which can also be found in words like \"Cornwall\" or \"walnut\". When King Edward I defeated Llywelyn the Last in 1282, the nation fell under the jurisdiction of England. At first, it was ruled as a separate country, but rebellion by Prince Owain Glynd\u0175r (considered in modern times as the 'Father of Welsh nationalism') led to incremental incorporation into England, and Wales was annexed through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542. Since the Act of Union in 1801, Wales has been part of the United Kingdom which includes England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland too.\nPrior to the industrial revolution, Wales was a sparsely populated country dependent on local agricultural and pastoral trade. However, due to the abundance of coal in the South Wales valleys, there was a phenomenal growth in population and a dynamic shift in the economy of South Wales during the 18th and 19th centuries (see Industrial Britain). The area of central Glamorgan, in particular, became a national focus for coal mining and steel production, while the ports of Cardiff and Swansea established themselves as commercial centres, offering banking, shopping and insurance facilities. Moreover, places on the north coast, such as Rhyl and Llandudno, developed into fun-fair type resorts serving the expanding populations of the major industrial cities of Lancashire.\nCoal mining has all but ceased and heavy industry declined. However, Wales' attractive scenery and rich history has lent itself to the development of tourism, while at the same time, Cardiff and Swansea have retained their rankings as centres of commerce and cutting-edge industry. Cardiff, which was designated as capital of Wales in 1955, has seen a huge amount of investment in institutions through 'devolution', also giving rise to a significant amount of political power being passed down from Westminster. Since 1999, Wales has had its own legislature separate from Westminster.\n\n\nPolitics\nWales is governed by a combination of local, Wales-, and UK-wide institutions. Many important matters are decided on a UK level, and Wales is represented by 40 MPs in the House of Commons. One of the greatest British statesmen of the 20th century was the Welshman David Lloyd George, who is the only Prime Minister whose first language was not English (it was Welsh).\n\nSince 1999, Wales has had its own devolved government and bilingual legislature. The Senedd Cymru - Welsh Parliament  sits in Cardiff Bay, in an eco-friendly building designed by Richard Rogers. The Senedd has a single chamber with 60 members, known as MSs, who are elected every five years. All residents of Wales aged 16 or over on election day are eligible to vote. Each elector casts two votes: one for the candidate they wish to be their local MS, and one for a party as a whole from a regional list. The resulting composition is 40 MSs who each represent a constituency directly, and 20 who are invested based on a form of proportional representation. The leader of the largest party in the Senedd typically becomes the First Minister (Prif Weinidog), who is head of the government. Since 2024, the First Minister has been Vaughan Gething (Labour), the first Black leader of a European nation.\nThe powers of the Welsh Government (Llywodraeth Cymru) have been expanded over time to cover matters such as agriculture, education, the environment, healthcare, housing, tourism, transport, and the Welsh language. This can lead to visible differences from the rest of the UK; for instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Welsh Government has imposed different restrictions at different times to those imposed by the UK Government in England.\nWales has long been generally more left-wing in its politics than the UK as a whole. The Labour Party has led each government since 1999, though it hasn't always been the sole party of government. Labour's strongholds are in the densely-populated south and north-east of the country. The pro-independence Plaid Cymru, which is ideologically social-democratic, is strongly supported in majority-Welsh-speaking areas in the north and west. The Conservative Party is most popular in rural areas near the border and in the south west, which tend to have fewer Welsh speakers. \nThere is wide support for increasing the powers of the devolved government still further, but support for full independence is limited and certainly lower than in Scotland. In the 2016 Brexit referendum, 53% of the electorate in Wales voted to leave the European Union but some areas were majority remain-voting; in January 2020, Wales left the EU along with the rest of the UK.\n\n\nCulture\nWales is part of Britain and so part of the UK, but is not part of England. It is correct to call Welsh people British, but incorrect and even offensive to call them English. Over the centuries, there have been minor revolts aimed at gaining independence, but in general Wales has accepted its place in the UK, and has made notable contributions to its politics and culture. Nevertheless, Wales has remained a bastion of Celtic culture, and the Welsh language continues to be a topic of pride and is widely spoken, especially in rural areas. It is now taught in all Welsh schools. As of 2020, around 29% of the population are able to speak Welsh.\n\nThe Prince of Wales (Tywysog Cymru) has been, since the 13th century, the eldest son of the sitting monarch, and is therefore usually the next in line to the British throne. It is for this reason that Wales is often referred to as a principality, even though the prince has no constitutional status in Wales, and doesn't even reside in the country. On 9 September 2022, King Charles III named HRH Prince William as the new Prince of Wales.\nThe prince's heraldic badge of feathers is sometimes used to symbolise Wales, though the daffodil flower, the leek and, above all, the red dragon tend to be more popular symbols. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd-George. Both the leek and daffodil are commonly worn on the lapels of people celebrating St David's Day, which is Wales's national day, celebrating the country's patron saint. Dragons have been associated with Wales since the early Middle Ages, and the red dragon (y ddraig goch) in particular has been used as a symbol of Wales throughout the centuries, and is now featured on the country's flag.\nRugby union is hugely popular in Wales and is considered the national sport. Attending a Wales international game in a packed-out Principality Stadium in Cardiff is a most electrifying experience, and a great opportunity to hear the country's national anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (The Land Of My Fathers), belted out by 50,000 or more Welsh fans.\nIndeed, the country is celebrated for its singing, with the ballads Calon L\u00e2n, Cwm Rhondda (Bread of Heaven) and Men of Harlech fundamental parts of the repertoire of any respectable Welsh choir. The country's long tradition of folk music and literature is celebrated annually at the National Eisteddfod, while famous musicians in the contemporary era include Sir Tom Jones, Dame Shirley Bassey, Katherine Jenkins and Bonnie Tyler, plus the rock bands, Stereophonics and Manic Street Preachers.\nOther famous Welsh people include Henry VII (the first of the Tudors, the famous dynasty of 15th and 16th century monarchs); Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Christian Bale (Hollywood actors); Aneurin Bevan (politician, father of the National Health Service); Gareth Edwards and Alun Wyn Jones (respectively a former and the current captain of Wales' national rugby team); Ryan Giggs (former footballer and now coach), Gareth Bale (former footballer); Bertrand Russell (philosopher); Dylan Thomas (poet and author) and Richard Burton (poet and actor, married Elizabeth Taylor twice, and linked to Thomas forever by Under Milk Wood).\n\n\nClimate\nWales has an oceanic climate just like the rest of the UK. \nIf it is not raining at the moment, it is certainly about to rain. This does, however, produce an intensely green and beautiful landscape. Summer average temperature is around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) while spring and autumn is about 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F). The weather varies substantially depending on the location and landscape, the coastal area being much milder than in the mountains. Wales experiences more intense rainfall than its eastern neighbour England. Cardiff is the wettest city in Wales. Snow is common on mountains in the winter. It can be bitterly cold up in the mountains and the valleys so make sure you wrap up warm before going on your adventure.\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Welsh phrasebook\n\nThe two official languages of Wales are English and Welsh (Cymraeg). \nWelsh is a Celtic language most closely related to Cornish and Breton, and more distantly to Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. Speakers live all over Wales, but it is most commonly spoken in the north and west; you are most likely to find native Welsh-speaking individuals in Carmarthenshire, Northern Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion, Gwynedd, and the Isle of Anglesey. An increasing number of people around the country are learning Welsh as a second language, and it is believed that, as of 2020, 29% of the population knows the language. The Welsh government has plans to increase the number of speakers to one million by 2050.\nBilingual signs are the norm in Wales, including on the roads, in shops, and at tourist attractions. Locals who are not fluent in Welsh usually know how to pronounce Welsh words, especially place names. There is lots of Welsh-language media including the TV channel S4C and BBC Radio Cymru.\nLearning Welsh is not necessary or expected from visitors, but Welsh people will react well if you show interest in their language. Using phrases like bore da (good morning), iechyd da (cheers), and diolch (thank you) will be greatly appreciated in most of the country; even non-Welsh-speakers are usually supportive and welcoming if you try a few words. \nThere are several regional accents of English spoken in Wales. That spoken in the South Wales Valleys and further west is perhaps closest to the 'stereotypical' Welsh accent, while in the North, where the greatest number of native Welsh speakers live, the accent is noticeably distinct and more nasal, blending in north-east Wales to something similar to Scouse (the accent and dialect of Liverpool). Cardiff has a distinct accent all of its own - the name is sometimes jokingly spelt 'Kairdiff' as an indication of this. However, no Welsh accent should present much difficulty to anyone with a decent command of English. There are a few colloquialisms that may take you a moment to work out what is meant, but don't be worried to ask for someone to repeat something. 'Aye' is commonly used to indicate 'yes' and 'ta-ra' can be said instead of 'goodbye'. 'Tidy' is often used but has a wide meaning ranging from fine/splendid or large (quantity), as in 'a tidy amount'. 'Butty'/'butt' is sometimes used for friend/buddy.\n\n\nGet in\nWales has the same immigration and visa requirements as the rest of the UK. All passengers travelling to the UK from outside Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man go through systematic passport/identity card and selective customs checks carried out by the UK Border Agency on arrival in the UK.\nThere is no internal border control between Wales and England. The road and train networks are fully integrated between England and Wales, meaning travel between the two nations should be stress-free.\n\n\nBy plane\nCardiff Airport (CWL IATA) is the only international airport in Wales. It is 9 mi (14 km) west of the city, near Rhoose. Anglesey Airport (VLY IATA) is the only other commercial airport in Wales, with weekday services to and from Cardiff.\n\nEastern Airways operate flights to Aberdeen and Newcastle.\nKLM operates services to Amsterdam 4 to 5 times a day.\nThere are also many seasonal flights catering to packaged holidays with companies such as Cosmos Holidays,  Ryanair and TUI Airways flying to many destinations in Greece, Spain and North Africa.\nThere are regular bus services from Cardiff city centre to the airport. You can also get to the airport using a bus service from Barry Station, which is closer to the airport and on local rail lines. A nearby railway line has a station at Rhoose, where there are shuttle buses to the airport.\nBristol Airport is also gaining popularity, and there are dedicated coach services between Bristol Airport and central Cardiff.\nBirmingham Airport is well served by long-haul destinations and is in easy driving distance to Wales. Liverpool John Lennon Airport is smaller, having flights mainly to continental Europe, but is in striking distance of North Wales.\nIt could be easier to fly to an airport in England such as one of the London airports when visiting South Wales, as a greater range of airlines and cities flown from are available from there to destinations around the world, with services from many airlines. However London is over 2 hours from Cardiff, and longer from many other places in Wales. If you do choose to fly into London, then Heathrow Airport is by far the closest to Wales in terms of travel time (around 2 hours to Cardiff, subject to traffic); Gatwick, Luton and Stansted airports are around an hour further away.  Other cities served by international airports in England which offer reasonable access to parts of Wales include Birmingham (BHX IATA) for mid Wales, Liverpool (LPL IATA) and Manchester (MAN IATA) for north Wales.\n\n\nBy car\n\nSouth Wales enjoys good motorway connections with the rest of the UK:\n\nThe M4 links southern England, including London and Bristol, to South Wales via the Severn Bridge. It serves Newport, Cardiff, Swansea, and Carmarthen.\nThe M50 links the West Midlands with Monmouth, the Brecon Beacons and all of South and West Wales.\nNorth Wales has no motorway connections. However there are still good road connections with the rest of the UK:\n\nThe A5 runs from the end of the M54 near Shrewsbury and takes you into Wales through the spectacular Snowdonia National Park\nThe A55, which is of motorway standard for most of its length, runs along the entire north coast from the English motorway network near Chester to the island of Anglesey. It is much quicker than the A5 although also less scenic.\nMid Wales only has single carriageway roads:\n\nThe A456 Shrewsbury to Welshpool being the main route\nThe A44 from  Worcester can be a slow route, but scenic and with quite a few nice places to stop in both countries\nThere are no internal border controls within Great Britain and you may not notice the border if entering Wales from England via a minor road. You will usually see the Croeso i Gymru (\"Welcome to Wales\") sign crossing the border.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also Rail travel in Great Britain\n\nThe three railway companies serving Wales are Transport for Wales, Avanti West Coast, and Great Western Railway (GWR).\n\n\nSouth Wales\nMain line rail services connect south Wales (especially Newport, Cardiff and Swansea) with all parts of the UK, via Avanti West Coast (to Birmingham and the North East, including Scotland), Transport for Wales (to the rest of Wales) and GWR (to London Paddington).\n\n\nNorth Wales\nThe North Wales Coast Line links Chester (and other parts of England) with the northern seaside resorts of Rhyl and Prestatyn, the city of Bangor, the isle of Anglesey and the port of Holyhead.  Through tickets to Dublin (Rep. of Ireland) are available, which include the ferry from Holyhead to Dublin Port. Services are run by Transport for Wales (from Manchester and Cardiff) and Avanti West Coast (from London and Crewe).\nThe Conwy Valley Line stretches from Llandudno Junction along the Conwy Valley via Betws y Coed to Blaenau Ffestiniog, and connects with trains on both the North Wales Coast line and the Ffestiniog Railway. Services are run by Transport for Wales.\nThe beautiful Cambrian Coast Line runs from Shrewsbury (in England), across Mid-Wales through Machynlleth, and through the coastal towns of Tywyn and Barmouth, through the south part of Snowdonia, Harlech and Porthmadog, and along the south coast of the Lleyn Peninsula to Pwllheli. Services are run by Transport for Wales.\nThe Shrewsbury-Chester Line runs from Shrewsbury to Chester, across the Wales-England border and the river Dee, passing Gobowen (in England, near Oswestry, also in England), Chirk (near the famous Pontcysyllte Aqueduct), Ruabon, Wrexham (General) and Chester. Services are run by Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast (from Wrexham General to Chester and beyond only).\nThe Borderlands Line runs between Wrexham (Central) and Bidston, linking various Flintshire towns and villages with the Wirral, and Wrexham. Services are run by Transport for Wales. Merseyrail services are available to Bidston, from the rest of the Wirral and Liverpool.\n\n\nMid Wales\nMid Wales is very sparsely populated and does not have extensive rail services. Nevertheless a few routes exist that show the beauty of the country:\n\nTransport for Wales also run the famous Heart of Wales Line from Swansea to Shrewsbury.  As the name suggests, this service runs through very scenic areas in the middle of the country. The train takes almost 4 hours to make the 120 mi (190 km) journey due to the many gradients and turns.  It is popular with tourists but also provides an essential service to rural communities along the route.\nThe Cambrian Line takes the same route as the Cambrian Coast Line as far as Machynlleth, where it goes southwards along the coast through Borth to the university town of Aberystwyth.\n\n\nBy coach\n\nNational Express operates coach services around the UK including to and from many parts of Wales. There are direct National Express coaches from London Heathrow Airport that go directly to Cardiff and Swansea.\n\n\nBy boat\nSee also: Ferry routes to British Mainland\nIt's possible to take several ferry routes from Ireland to Wales, the main routes are Holyhead (which is on Holy Island, linked to the island of Anglesey by a causeway, and Anglesey is linked by bridge to mainland Wales) and Fishguard on the south-west coast. These tend to be the cheapest and fastest, if you hunt around between the different ferry companies. Stenaline and Irish Ferries offer multiple daily services for passengers and vehicles. Bookings can be made through their websites. Stena operate the route to Fishguard, Irish Ferries operate the route to Pembroke Dock, and both operate to Holyhead.\n\nFishguard - Rosslare in South Eastern Ireland\nHolyhead - Dublin\nPembroke - Rosslare\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nGeneral\nDue to Wales' topography and historic development, most travelling in Wales is done east-west rather than north-south. Rail and road links between centres in South Wales and along the North Wales coast are usually quick and efficient, especially along the M4 and A55. An important exception to this is M4, J32 (the interchange with the A470), during peak morning rush hour, which gets congested with Cardiff commuter traffic. The roundabout at J32 is the largest in Europe. Most places in South Wales are within a 90-min drive of each other.\nTravelling between Cardiff and the other main population centres, Swansea and Newport, is very straightforward.\nAlthough only approximately 170 mi (270 km) from coast to coast, the topography makes north-south links more difficult in terms of time. By land, journey times are comparable to flight times across North America! However, the journey itself is something a visitor may wish to do to see the scenery.\n\nTraveline Cymru - bus, coach and rail journey planning and timetable information\n\n\nBy plane\nWales is a small country and flying is not a common mode of internal transport. The only domestic route, Cardiff International Airport to Anglesey Airport ceased in 2022.\n\n\nBy car\nSee also: Driving in the UK\n\nIt is much easier to drive from east to west across Wales (via the M4 or A55, for instance) than from north to south, due to the lack of fast roads across the sparsely-populated interior. You should allow 5 or 6 hours to tackle this. But that is time well spent, as the journey takes in some spectacular scenery. The two main north-south roads are the A470 (Cardiff to Llandudno) and the A483 (Swansea to Chester). However, neither is a fast road: the A470, for instance, has only a 25-mile (40-km) dual-carriageway stretch, from Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfil; while much of the rest of the route has been improved, there are still many places where the road is narrow and winding, and where trucks or agricultural vehicles can slow traffic considerably. Those travelling from the north-east to the south-east may find it quicker to use the English motorway network (M6 and M5), or the A49 road through Shropshire and Herefordshire.\nRoads are generally well-maintained and signposted, although flooding is a risk after heavy rain - particularly in the wetter west and north - and the higher mountain passes can become icy and treacherous in winter. In rural areas, minor roads are usually very narrow, just wide enough for a single tractor, while high hedges on either side can obstruct your view of oncoming traffic. A sensible speed and liberal beeps of your horn when tackling corners are essential. When \u2014 not if \u2014 you meet an oncoming vehicle, one of you will have to reverse to the nearest passing place, which should be no more than a couple of hundred metres away. Beware of livestock on the roads: sheep often graze on roadside verges, including alongside main roads in rural areas, and can stray on to the carriageway seemingly oblivious to passing traffic. It is also quite common for farmers to have to herd sheep or cattle along or across a road from one field to another. If you come across this, remember that the farmer is just doing his or her job, and be patient: sounding your horn or revving your engine will only alarm the livestock and annoy the farmer, causing even greater delays.\n\n\nBilingual road signs\nRoad signage is bilingual, as much for instructions as for place names. There is no colour or font differentiation between English and Welsh, but since 2016 all new road signs have placed Welsh before English. Prior to then, the order varied, so older signs may show English first. \nA few examples are given below:\n\n\nBy train\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain\nDue to various closures in the 1960s there is no true \"Welsh railway system\". Basically there are three separate Welsh limbs which are part of the British system although there have been moves to improve intra-Wales railway services. The limbs are a North Wales line to Holyhead, a line to Aberystwyth in the centre, and a main line in South Wales, forming an extension of the London Paddington to West of England main line.\nTransport for Wales provides most train services within Wales.\nTwo cross-border train companies may also be of use for internal train journeys within Wales. Great Western Railway provide the bulk of cross border services between England and South Wales. Their flagship High Speed Service generally goes as far west as Swansea, and there are even a limited number to destinations further West. Their \"local\" services to Bristol Temple Meads and the South West of England go no further west than Cardiff. Arriva Trains Cross Country provide services as far west as Cardiff to Birmingham and onwards to Nottingham.\nRegular train services connect the South Wales' three main cities, Cardiff, Swansea and Newport. Services between Cardiff and Swansea are usually every 20 minutes, and even more frequent between Cardiff and Newport.\nCardiff is also the hub of the Valley Line network which serves a number of former coal mining towns. This railway system was built to carry coal; it is now mainly a commuter network and is useful to visitors to the Valleys, or indeed for local travel within Cardiff.\nSwansea and Llanelli in the West are linked to Mid Wales via the Heart of Wales railway, whilst not a quick journey it is well worth considering for its scenery.\nRail connections between North and South Wales in fact cross into neighbouring England, although there are a number of direct services between Cardiff and North Wales along the Marches line via several places in England. There are two high speed services each day between Holyhead and Cardiff, which only stop at a limited number of stations in England.\n\nTransport for Wales (Trafnidiaeth Cymru) operates most local rail services in Wales\nGreat Western Railway operates cross border services between South Wales and Bristol, Reading, Portsmouth, and London Paddington.\nAvanti West Coast operates services from North Wales to Crewe, Birmingham, and London Euston.\nCrosscountry operates an hourly service between Nottingham and Cardiff, going through Birmingham.\n\n\nBy bus and coach\nThe First Cymru Shuttle coach service is usually quicker than the train for journeys between Swansea and Cardiff, but at peak times, the train does not get stuck in traffic!\nGovernment-funded Traws Cambria services connect North, Mid and South Wales.\n\nArriva operates a large amount of bus services in North Wales\nFirst Cymru operates services in South West Wales\nStagecoach operates services in South Wales\nCardiff Bus operates services in Cardiff\nVeolia Transport Cymru operates services in Cardiff and South Wales\nTraveline Cymru has a search facility for all Welsh public transport routes.\n\n\nBy bike\nNational Cycle Route 5 follows the Wales Coast Path, National Cycle Route 8 runs from Cardiff to Holyhead and National Cycle Route 47 is also known as the Celtic Trail.\n\n\nSee\n\nWales has many significant attractions, and listed below are a few of the most notable. For more details about these attractions plus information on other places of interest, check under regional sections.\nMuch of Wales' scenery is spectacular, and environmentally important. To protect the environment certain parts of Wales have been designated as \"National Parks\" or as \"Areas of Outstanding  Natural Beauty\". An area with either of these designation will have a high degree of protection from inappropriate development. Whilst these rules exist for environmental reasons, rather than to promote tourism, because \"National Parks\" and \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\" have this protection, a visitor to these areas can be confident that they will see some unspoiled scenery. These areas offer some of Wales' most attractive scenery, and a visitor would be well advised to visit at least one of these areas. That is not to say that there aren't other attractive places in Wales, but the \"National Parks\" and \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\" are the \"jewels in the outdoor crown\".\n\nWales has three National Parks: Brecon Beacons National Park (Mid Wales), spectacular mountain scenery and castles, pretty highlands turned into a national park with weaving streams, waterfalls and canals; Pembrokeshire Coast National Park (South Wales) with dramatic coastal scenery; and Snowdonia National Park (North Wales) covering Wales' highest mountains, and considered by some to be the most beautiful and poetic in Britain.\nNational Park status offers the highest level of environmental and planning protection in Wales. National Parks tend to cover some very large areas. It should therefore come as no surprise, that some of Wales' most important scenery can be found within its National Parks. Each \"National Park\" is administered by a special-purpose local authority, called a \"National Park Authority\". These organisations primarily exist to ensure that laws protecting the environment and scenery are followed. Nevertheless a National Park Authority will organise and run various facilities in the area which are clearly \"branded\" as official facilities. These facilities will include public toilets, car parks, visitor centres, and even gift shops selling branded merchandise. However the National Park Authority does not own most of the land in these areas, and so there is private and charitable provision of facilities such as car parking, and retail outlets too. It is also usual that the boundaries of a national park are marked on the ground where roads enter them, so you will often know when you have entered a National Park, for example there may be a stone or a sign stating you are entering the area. The websites of the relevant National Park Authorities will often have a section designed particularly for visitors and may well be very useful to someone planning a trip to the area, even containing information such as accommodation information.\n\nOther important areas which do not have National Park status, have the alternative status of Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). These areas tend to cover smaller areas than \"National Parks\", they will nevertheless be of interest to visitors. AONBs are not run by government but are simply areas with a similar level of protection to National Parks, but remaining under the jurisdiction of the relevant local authority. Like the National Park Authorities, local authorities with \"AONBs\" in their area do generally take their duties seriously to enforce planning laws, but unlike them, may not organise any \"AONB\" branded facilities in these areas. So there don't tend to be official branded facilities such as visitor centres, car parks, and gift shops. These facilities may exist but by conventional private, charitable and municipal provision. The actual boundaries of AONBs - whilst they are often shown on the rear covers of \"Ordnance Survey\" maps, tend to be of importance to local government officials and landowners, rather than tourists. It is therefore not usual to see markers or signs at the boundaries of these areas on the ground. The official websites of \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\" are usually part of a local authority's main website. They may still have useful information, but do not expect the same level of specialisation as on a National Park website.\nThe Isle of Anglesey AONB is predominantly coastal, covering most of the island's 125-mile coastline. Gower Peninsula (Swansea), UK's first designated area of outstanding natural beauty, covers most of the peninsula. Lleyn AONB, the peninsula sticking out westwards beyond Snowdonia, in the north-west of the country. Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB is a range of hills running southwards from the coast at Prestatyn, Denbighshire in the north-east of the country, close to the border with England, now extended to include the spectacular hills around the river Dee near Llangollen. The Wye Valley AONB straddles the southern end of the England/Wales border  between Hereford and Chepstow\n\nA number of UNESCO World Heritage sites can be visited, including the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct - near Chirk and of course the North Wales Castles built in the decades after the invasion or conquest of Wales by England in the 13th century, representing the most advanced military technology of the time, being compared with the Crusader Castles of the Middle East. Castles of note being Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech.\nKey listed historic building worth visiting include Caerphilly castle, the second largest in the UK, Pembroke castle, Raglan castle, the ruins of Tintern abbey and the incredibly preserved and restored Elizabethan house Plas Mawr in Conwy.\nThere is a good selection of national museums and galleries to visit. These are: The National Museum (collection of paintings, archaeological finds and geological exhibits ), Cardiff; St Fagans National History Museum (many historic buildings, relocated from their original site), near Cardiff; The National Slate Museum, Llanberis; Big Pit (The National Coal Museum),Blaenafon; The National Woollen Museum, Dre-fach Felindre, near Llandysul; The National Roman Legionary Museum, Caerleon, Newport; The National Waterfront Museum (maritime and industrial past), Swansea.\nEntry to national museums are free, although expect a charge for car parking.\nThere are also many stately homes, gardens and estate parks to visit. One of the most visited being the National Botanic Garden of Wales near Carmarthen.\n\n\nDo\n\nHeritage railways are more generally thought of as pleasurable attractions rather than ways to get around, although the Ffestiniog Railway, initially depended on gravity and horse power, from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffestiniog can be used to link places on main rail lines, and the opening of the Welsh Highland Railway has created a useful link between Caernarfon, Beddgelert and Porthmadog. The Vale of Rheidol Railway provides a novel way from Aberystwyth to Devil's Bridge. They are all historic lines that have been either preserved or restored with steam a major feature on these lines. Others include Bala Lake Railway, Brecon Mountain Railway, Gwili Railway, Llanberis Lake Railway, Welshpool and Llanfair Railway, Talyllyn Railway the World's first heritage railway, and perhaps the best known of all the Snowdon Mountain Railway.\n\nWales' offers some spectacular coastal and mountainous scenery. Which offers the opportunity for various activity holidays.\n\n\nHiking\nSee also: Walking in the United Kingdom\nGood paths to walk on are the Wales Coast Path  or Offa's Dyke Path near the border of Wales and England. \nFor the more experienced Snowdon is the highest mountain in Wales at 1,085 m (3,560 ft) and Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons, is the highest mountain in South Wales at 886 m (2,907 ft). Cadair Idris, close to the Mid-Wales coast, overlooking Dolgellau to the north and Bro Dysynni to the south-west is another very popular mountain. It has good rail access on both North and South sides from the Cambrian Coast Line, but this is virtually at sea level. The actual summit is 893 m (2,930 ft) above sea level. This makes for a strenuous walk which takes most of the day.\n\n\nGolf\nWales has a long golfing history, with many top-quality courses, however it offers golf courses which tend to be less crowded, and less expensive than the other Western European destinations. As a very rough rule North Wales tends to have the better links courses, and the South the better parkland courses, although it is well worth playing both sorts of courses in both parts of Wales just to find out! There is a relatively high density of courses in the Vale of Glamorgan, between Cardiff and Bridgend, due to the proliferation of courses in the last fifteen years serving the Cardiff Commuter Belt. There is also a high density of courses in the Conwy and Llandudno area. Further details can be obtained from the Welsh Assembly Government's official golf tourism website, and on pages concerning the specific areas of Wales. Wales' most prestigious courses include: The Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Monmouthshire, it has three courses, and is the venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup; Conwy (Caernarvonshire), Conwy, Caernarvonshire - this Links hosted a final qualifying round for the 2006 Open Championship; Machynys Golf and Country Club, Llanelli, Carmarthenshire - Links, opened in 2005 Wales' first and so far only Nicklaus-designed course.\n\n\nScuba diving\nScuba diving, exploration beneath its surrounding seas, is an activity not many tourists think of when visiting Wales. Although weather conditions are not always perfect, water temperatures are quite chilly, scuba diving in Wales is one of the best experiences for divers around Europe. You can find whales, dolphins, plenty of seals but also superb coral formations including seahorses and several coral fish. The Isle of Anglesey has been encircled by shipping routes for centuries resulting in striking shipwrecks of all sizes. Pembrokeshire with its scenic islands Skomer Island, Skokholm Island and the isolated rocks called the Smalls are known for their colonies of seals and many shipwrecks.\n\n\nBirdwatching\nWales is a great destination for birdwatching. The long coastline provides excellent habitats for seabirds, and the hinterland is home to many birds of prey. Notable destinations are Bwlch Nant yr Arian Forest Visitor Centre for red kites, Cors Dyfi Reserve for Osprey, while for seabird must-visits are the South Stack Cliffs RSPB reserve and the Conwy RSPB reserve.\n\n\nAgritourism\nWales has a fantastic agricultural scene and travellers are encouraged to experience it. You can see the Royal Welsh agricultural show, you can go to a small town sheep auction, or a sheep dog trail.\n\n\nMusic\n\nSee also: Music in Britain and Ireland\nWales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", and is notable for its harpists, male voice choirs, and plethora of solo artists, such as Katherine Jenkins and Charlotte Church. Cardiff has a big rock scene and has produced some of the biggest acts in the UK today. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. Check the web sites of local male voice choirs for dates of concerts.\nThe principal Welsh festival of music and poetry is the annual  National Eisteddfod (Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru). Taking place in the first week of August, a Welsh-language week-long event with simultaneous translation available for the main events that is hosted by a different town each year, alternating between north and south Wales. Its history can be traced back to 1176, and its modern incarnation had been running since 1861.   \nThe Llangollen International Eisteddfod echoes the National Eisteddfod but provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. Traditional music and dance in Wales is supported by a myriad of societies.\nNotable musical events include the Cardiff Singer of the World Competition, the Brecon Jazz Festival (August) and the Swansea Festival of Music and the Arts an annual (October) three-week bash of culture at various locations in Swansea, and the second largest such festival in the UK.\nOthers of note include the Faenol Festival organised by the internationally renowned opera singer Bryn Terfel, (August Bank Holiday weekend every year at Y Felinheli) and Sesiwn Fawr a World Music Festival which takes place every July in Dolgellau.\n\n\nLiterary events\n\nThe famous Hay Festival literary festival, which Bill Clinton aptly described as 'The Woodstock for the Mind.' takes place end of May beginning of June.\nThe Dylan Thomas Festival in Swansea is an annual event held between 27 October and 9 November (the dates of the poet's birth and death) to commemorate the works of Thomas. In addition, the festival hosts the awards' ceremony for the winner of the Dylan Thomas Prize - a biannual writing competition for most outstanding literary talent in English, aged under 30. Complementing the main events at the Dylan Thomas Festival the Dylan Thomas Fringe is held at various venues throughout the city.\n\n\nSports\nSix Nations Rugby Tournament - Cardiff's Millennium Stadium (known for sponsorship reasons as Principality Stadium) hosts two or three matches per year as part of the premier Northern Hemisphere Rugby Tournament. Cardiff will host many visitors attending the game. Tickets and accommodation would generally need to be bought well in advance. If you are able to see a match then it is a valuable insight into Welsh culture, whether watching in a pub or in the Millennium Stadium.\nRugby is the national sport of Wales. The Welsh locals love supporting their national team and local clubs. Rugby union is very popular but the league code is rare, unlike in England. Cardiff is often rammed with both locals and tourists supporting Wales in the World Cups and the 6 Nations. At club level, the country's top four teams\u2014Cardiff Rugby, Dragons (Newport), Ospreys (Swansea), and Scarlets (Llanelli)\u2014play in the United Rugby Championship, which also features teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and South Africa. Wales also has a fully domestic league system, the top level of which is known as the Welsh Premier Division; teams in that league are basically developmental operations for the URC sides.\nFootball  is also popular in Wales, though attendances in the local Welsh league (the top level of which is known as Cymru Premier) are low, and the two biggest Welsh clubs, Cardiff City and Swansea City, both play in the English league system. In addition, virtually all the top Welsh players play for English rather than Welsh clubs. That said, the Welsh national team enjoys strong support, having featured world-class players such as Ryan Giggs and Gareth Bale, and play their home games in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. For instance, the 2017 UEFA Champions League Finals was held in Cardiff.\nWales Rally GB is usually the final round of the FIA World Rally Championship, held near the end of each year in many locations around Wales.\nCricket: Wales is part of the England & Wales national cricket structure. Glamorgan CCC is one of the First Class Counties, playing at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The other counties field a combined Wales NC team in the lower tier, the National Counties Cricket Championship, formerly known as \"Minor Counties\".\n\n\nBuy\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, Wales uses the pound sterling (\u00a3).  Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, there are no separate banknotes in Wales, only those issued by the Bank of England.  Indeed, Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes may not be easy to spend, although they can be exchanged at any bank.  Most banks and travel agents will also change foreign currency, although it is worth shopping around for the best rates.\nATMs are widespread, even in small towns: they can be found in many post offices, convenience stores and petrol stations as well as in banks.  However, many banks in small towns have closed, and ATMs in other locations often charge you (maybe \u00a31-2) for withdrawing cash.\nAs in the rest of the UK, beware of ATM fraud, which is becoming increasingly common.  The fraud works either by 'skimming' your card (reading the details on it with a device attached to the ATM) or trapping it in the machine, and using a hidden camera to record your PIN as you enter it. Never use an ATM with a card slot which appears to have been tampered with, and always cover the key pad with your hand, wallet or purse when entering your PIN.  If you find an ATM which seems to have been tampered with, or if it retains your card, report this at once to the bank which owns it and to the police.\n\n\nCosts\nCosts are broadly comparable with the rest of the UK; hotels, bars and restaurants in Cardiff are relatively expensive, while the rest of the country is perhaps slightly cheaper.  Petrol and diesel is often much more expensive in rural Wales than in the main towns and cities.\n\n\nEat\nSee also: Welsh cheese\n\nWales is associated with many particular dishes, and there are a number of unique foods that you might like to try. The quality of local ingredients is often very high, with a drive towards locally sourced, organic produce in many restaurants.\n\n Roast lamb. Wales is noted for the high quality of its lamb, due to the luscious green grass they graze on. Often served with mint sauce and vegetables.   \n Cawl (Lobscouse). A lamb broth.   \n Bara brith. A rich, sweet bread loaf speckled with dried fruit, similar to a fruitcake.   \n Welsh rarebit (original spelling Welsh rabbit). A melted cheese and mustard dish, often spiced with onions, ale and herbs and served on toasted bread.   \n Laverbread (pronounced \"lar-ver\"). Is not, as the name implies, bread, but a pur\u00e9e made from seaweed (the same kind that is used in the preparation of Japanese nori). It is generally rolled into small cakes, mixed with oatmeal and served at breakfast alongside bacon rashers, though it is delicious heated and served on buttered toast. This dish is known throughout Wales but especially in the Swansea area and can be purchased raw at Swansea Market.   (updated Jun 2018)\n Ice cream. Due to an influx of Italians into Wales, the country has some of the best cones and tubs in Britain. The following are UK national award winners: Frank's Ice Cream in Carmarthenshire, Joe's Ice-cream in Swansea and Fecci & Sons Ice Cream in Tenby. La Belle Rouge in Aberystwyth is also very highly recommended. One of the most well-known ice cream cafes in the north west is a chain called Cadwaladers, which has since expanded to Cardiff and England. \n Welsh cakes. A delicious type of griddle scone, usually containing dried fruit or sometimes jam and covered in sugar. Best eaten warm.   \nSeveral of the above dishes are now rarely eaten and may not be found on restaurant menus. Many cuisines are now represented in Welsh towns and cities, with even small towns and villages usually having takeaways, with Chinese, Indian, pizza and kebab being most common as well as the traditional fish and chips. Cardiff and Swansea have a much wider range of restaurants and cuisines represented including a number of star-rated restaurants. The country and village pubs have their own distinctive style of cuisine.\nVegetarianism and veganism is popular in Wales like its neighbour England. It is easy to find vegetarian meals in the big cities and towns. Even small towns or villages usually have a few vegetarian options in pubs and cafes. For vegans, Swansea and Cardiff offer the most options. Veganism is rare or non existent in rural areas.\nFor more information, see the general article on eating in the UK.\nAs with the rest of the United Kingdom, smoking in enclosed public areas, which includes restaurants and cafes, is illegal in Wales, and there is an on-the-spot fine of \u00a350 for those who violate the ban.\n\n\nDrink\nAlthough the temperance movement was strong in Wales; beer was and still is a popular drink. There are a large number of small independent breweries in Wales, of which one well-known brand is Double Dragon from Felinfoel Brewery near Llanelli (Wales' oldest) is a must to taste. Wrexham Lager, after an absence of over a decade, Wrexham has its famous lager back and also back to its former glory. The owners are focusing on and giving a boost to the local pubs. One of the largest breweries in Glamorgan, Brains brews a decent range of ales\nAfter an absence of over 100 years, Wales rejoined the club of Celtic countries that produce whisky in 2004 with the launch of the Welsh Whisky Company. This distillery is based out of the village of Penderyn, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons near Aberdare in South Wales.  Penderyn whisky has received a number of awards and makes an interesting addition to the world of whisky.  The distillery visitor centre opened in June 2008.\nThe other major beverage produce is, not surprisingly, bottled water.\nSee the more general article on drinking in the UK, with information on pubs and real ale.\nBe careful on Friday and Saturday nights especially in the big cities and towns. You could encounter drunks anywhere but mostly outside pubs and bars and very poor areas. If you're unsafe around drunk people, get to a safe area.\n\n\nSleep\nWales is very tourist-friendly, so finding hotel accommodation, a self-catering holiday cottage or a place to pitch a tent should not be a problem. However, you might need to make prior reservations during the summer season in tourist areas such as Anglesey, Llandudno, Llangollen, Lleyn, Rhyl, Swansea/Mumbles and Tenby, or around the time of major sporting or cultural events in Cardiff.\n\n\nLearn\nSee also: Studying abroad#United Kingdom\n\nThe Welsh education system is similar to the educational system in England, with a few differences here and there. The most notable feature of the Welsh educational system is compulsory Welsh-language lessons in all state schools until the age of 16. The Welsh language is an important cultural part of the Welsh nation.\nThe country is home to eight universities and one conservatoire, the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Perhaps the most prestigious institute of higher education in Wales is Cardiff University, which is often regarded as one of the top universities in the United Kingdom and the world. \nIf there's one thing that attracts many students to Wales, it's the low cost of living. Costs in Wales are much lower compared to other parts of the United Kingdom. Cardiff is remarkably cheaper to live in than say, London. \nWales is a great place to learn Welsh and Welsh people love it if you show interest in their language. If you want to learn the language, there are a few options to choose from, as shown below. \n\n Welsh for Adults, Cardiff University. Variety of programmes in Welsh as a second language, from 1 day to 12 months in length. \n\n\nWork\nThe major cities of Swansea and Cardiff have a growing number of white collar office jobs. The more rural areas, and especially the former mining communities in the Valleys are extremely impoverished and unlikely to offer many opportunities.\n\n\nStay safe\nIn any emergency call 999 or 112 and ask for Ambulance, Fire, Police or Coast Guard when connected. For non-urgent Police matters,  dial 101 to be connected to the nearest police station anywhere in Wales.\n\n\nCrime\nWales is one of the safest parts of the United Kingdom and crime rates continue to fall. Nonetheless, criminal activity including violent crime is not uncommon, especially alcohol-related violence in towns and cities. Indeed, it may be wise to avoid the centres of large towns and cities on weekend nights and after large sporting events. Despite this, it is unlikely that tourists would be targeted in such a situation. Pickpocketing and mugging is rare.\n\n\nDriving\nIt is perfectly safe to drive on Welsh roads. However, care should be taken on rural and minor roads, some of which are extremely narrow and poorly marked. In addition, colliding with a sheep or (even worse) a cow can severely damage your car, not to mention the unfortunate animal. Many of these roads pass through some of the most beautiful parts of Wales, but just ensure that at least as much attention is paid to the road as to the scenery! Some areas of Wales are not suitable for learner drivers due to extreme terrain. If you're a learner, wait till you're more experienced for winter driving or going through the mountains. Like the rest of the UK, Wales drives on the left.\n\n\nNatural hazards\n\nWhile generally escaping extreme weather, it should not be forgotten that the British Isles enjoy a famously changeable climate and few places more so than Wales. As such, it is extremely important to be prepared when venturing into the countryside and especially onto the mountains. Here, what starts as a sunny day can rapidly turn into a blizzard, storm-force gale or a disorienting, chilling fog. Every year, many have to be rescued from Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons and some lives are lost due to falls and exposure. Ensure you have suitable clothing, a map and a fully-charged mobile phone before setting off.\nThunderstorms aren't common in Wales, but if there is a thunderstorm warning, get yourself to safety.\nOn the coast, tides can cut you off on rapidly disappearing sea-level land. On the cliff tops be aware that the land can overhang the cliff edge being very thin and unstable.\nThere is little danger from animals, with only a small chance of coming across the adder snake which is venomous. Bites are painful but rarely fatal; stay calm but get to a doctor if bitten. The most dangerous animals are cattle and the occasional aggressive sheep. It is very rare to come across a live dragon.\n\n\nRespect\nWelsh society is generally warm, informal, and welcoming, with a tradition of acceptance and tolerance (for instance, there is no history of support for racist political parties in Wales' larger cities). \nRefer to people from Wales as \"Welsh\", and not \"English\". Using the latter term is a crass error and it could get people to think that you're trying to start an argument. Most Welsh people don't object to being called \"British\", but as always, follow the locals' lead.\nThe relationship between Wales and England is quite complex. The geopolitical ties between England and Wales are strong, though some light-hearted anti-English sentiment is common. Despite this, English people in Wales are unlikely to face any issues.\nAttempts to speak Welsh will be welcomed and will most certainly endear you to the locals. Everyone in Wales has heard the tired old canards about the language having no vowels or room-fulls of people instantly switching from English to Welsh when a tourist walks in; if these are in your repertoire of \"jokes\", keep them to yourself.\nThe issue of Welsh independence is certainly much debated and has been seeing a rise in support in the 21st century. In some areas, there are high levels of support for independence. Whilst nowhere near as sensitive or divisive as in other parts of the world, it's best to steer clear of discussing this topic altogether. \nWelsh culture is often liberal. Generally speaking, the most liberal laidback areas are big cities and tourist places. Outside these places, Welsh culture is more conservative particularly in rural areas with locals following traditional procedures.\nWales is much like the rest of the UK regarding attitudes towards homosexuality. Displays of homosexuality are not always commonplace, possibly due to the rural nature of some parts of the country, although outward displays of same-sex affection are unlikely to cause a problem. Larger towns and cities are also friendly and open minded, but issues are not unheard of. The most accepting places for LGBT are Cardiff and Swansea. Outside major towns and cities, some locals may be offended by your sexuality, but that's their problem. Homophobic attacks are extremely rare but possible, and all discrimination based on sexuality is illegal in Wales, as it is in the rest of the UK.\n\n\nConnect\n\nSee Connect entry in our United Kingdom article for information on telephone, internet and postal services. Some rural areas do not have mobile phone reception. Few areas, including towns, have high-speed internet.\nSee Connect entries in individual city articles for local information.\n\n\nGo next\nTo the east the English border counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire are a quiet, almost undiscovered area, before you move in to the higher population areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside. Or if you are looking for the quintessential England try the Cotswolds.\nIreland, if you have not had enough of beautiful wet green landscapes then this is the direction to go. Reachable by ferry from a number of places on the west coast.",
