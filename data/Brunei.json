  "extract": "The Sultanate of Brunei is a small but \u2014 thanks to natural gas and petroleum resources \u2014 very rich country on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. \nAlthough Brunei is not on most travellers' radar, it is a country of tranquil mosques, pristine jungles, and friendly inhabitants. Its full name is Negara Brunei Darussalam, with Darussalam appropriately meaning \"Abode of Peace\".\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Bandar Seri Begawan \u2013 the capital, sometimes known as \"Bandar\" or \"BSB\" for short\n2 Bangar \u2013 gateway town to the unspoilt nature of Temburong\n3 Kuala Belait \u2013 second largest city and border town on the way to Sarawak, Malaysia\n4 Muara \u2014 a small port town\n5 Seria  \u2013 centre for the oil industry, with a dedicated museum and the Billionth Barrel Monument\n6 Tutong \u2013 a small town, located on the banks of Tutong River\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Ulu Temburong National Park \u2013 the first and the only national park established in Brunei, contains unspoilt jungle and is known as the \"Green Jewel of Brunei\"\n\n\nUnderstand\nBrunei is a pint-sized oil-rich sultanate with a population of 450,000 as of 2016, strategically positioned on the South China Sea, close to vital sea lanes linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its oil resources have generated great wealth for the Sultan and some of the local people, and the best evidence of this is seen in the palaces and mosques. However many Bruneians, including those who live in the water village (Kampong Ayer), still have relatively simple, albeit comfortable livelihoods.\nThe description of an \"oil-rich sultanate\" might conjure the images of Dubai or Qatar, but travellers with such expectations will likely be disappointed. Brunei does not have much in terms of grandiose man-made attractions, and although excellent diving and jungle trekking are available, it does not have mind-blowing natural parks as the neighbouring Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak do. Many people that visit Brunei actually do so only for the sake of \"country collection\" or \"passport stamp collection\".\nIf there are attractions particular to Brunei, it is perhaps the absence of crowds, the comfortable but relaxed atmosphere, and the way that society remains religious and conservative, refusing to embrace modernity and globalisation despite having the material wealth to do so.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe Sultanate of Brunei's heyday occurred between the 15th-17th centuries, when its control extended over coastal areas of northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate. It was offered the opportunity to join Malaysia as a state in 1963, but opted out of the federation due to a disagreement on the amount of its oil income that would have to be given to the central government in Kuala Lumpur. After an Indonesian-backed insurrection failed in 1962, the Sultan consolidated power as an absolute monarch, and the country is under a constant state of emergency renewed every 2 years. Independence was achieved in 1984. One family has ruled Brunei for over six centuries.\nAfter independence, the Brunei Investment Agency invested some US$40 billion of Brunei's funds in Finance Minister Prince Jefri Bolkiah's Amedeo fund. When the Asian financial crisis hit in 1998, it turned out that Jefri had appropriated some $14.8 billion of the sum for himself, using the funds to amass 2,000 cars, a private Boeing 747 jumbo jet, a yacht named Tits and life-size golden statues of himself having sex. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah sent Jefri to the naughty corner and has personally overseen the sultanate's finances ever since.\n\nIndependence\n1 Jan 1984 (from the UK)\nNational holiday\nNational Day, 23 Feb (1984); by tradition Brunei's independence is celebrated on this day \u2014 23 Feb 1984 was the date of independence from British protection, while 1 Jan 1984 was the date of political independence from the UK\nConstitution\n29 Sep 1959 (some provisions suspended under a State of Emergency since Dec 1962, others since independence)\nLandmarks\n\nThe Istana Nurul Iman is the world's largest occupied residential palace. The 300-acre palace sits on a man-made hill with a clear view of Kampong Ayer. Istana Nurul Iman is the residence of the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, and the palace is quoted to have an estimated value at USD 600 million.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe backbone of Brunei's economy is oil and gas and the Sultan of Brunei is, famously, one of the richest people in the world with an estimated personal wealth of around USD 40 billion. Per capita GDP is far above most other developing countries, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides all citizens with a comprehensive welfare state without levying any income tax.\nAll sectors of the economy are fairly heavily regulated and government policy is an odd mixture of subsidies, protectionism and encouragement of entrepreneurship. Brunei's leaders are attempting to balance the country's steadily increasing integration into the world economy with internal social cohesion. It became a more prominent player in the world by serving as chairman for the 2005 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) Forum. Plans for the future include upgrading the workforce, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and tourist sectors, and, in general, widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.\n\n\nCulture\n\nGiven their shared history, Brunei shares many cultural similarities with neighbouring Malaysia, with the Malay language serving as a common link between both countries.\nBrunei is officially an Islamic state, with many large beautiful mosques across the country. Sale of alcohol is banned. Bringing in meat (other than seafood) that has not been certified \"halal\" (slaughtered according to Islamic law) is also banned. It is possible, however, to find pork at eateries catering to the ethnic Chinese community. During the fasting month of Ramadan, many non-Muslim-owned shops and restaurants will be open. However, eating, drinking or smoking in front of people who are fasting is considered rude and asking permission is appropriate. Expect everything to be closed - including hotel restaurants, and all shops - during Friday prayers (12:00-14:00) all year.  Things start closing around 11:00, and start reopening again around 14:00. Even the buses stop running, though you might still be able to catch a water taxi.\nThe bulk of the population is Malay (67%) and there is also a significant Chinese minority of around 15% as well as a number of indigenous peoples, including the Iban and Dusun tribes who inhabit the jungle upriver and the Temburong district (the smaller eastern part detached from the rest of Brunei).  There are many foreign workers who work on the oil and gas production or in lower positions such as restaurant staff, field workers and domestic staff. The male to female ratio is 3:2. More than a quarter of the people are short term immigrant workers, most of whom are men.\n\n\nGeography and climate\nBrunei's climate is sub-tropical. Temperatures range from 14-33\u00b0C, January being the hottest month. The rainy season is always mild and humid, followed by a hot and humid dry season. The difference between the two seasons is not that marked, however.  The rainforest and jungle areas tend to be cooler and wetter than the coastal region.\nBrunei's topology is of a flat coastal plain rises to mountains in the east, the highest point being Bukit Pagan at 1,850 metres, with some hilly lowlands in the west.\nThere are no typhoons, earthquakes, severe flooding or other forms of natural disasters to contend with, and the biggest environmental issue is the seasonal haze resulting from forest fires (that is caused by illegal clearing of land) in nearby Indonesia.\n\n\nTourist information\nBrunei Tourism website\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Malay phrasebook\nThe official language of Brunei is Malay (Bahasa Melayu), but due to its British colonial past, English is widely spoken and understood in urban areas, though sometimes with a thick accent. A little Malay will come in handy in rural areas, as English proficiency is limited there. \nWhile all Bruneians are able to speak standard Malay, the local dialect of Malay has some ideosyncrasies that can make it tricky to understand if you only just started learning Malay. Brunei also officially uses the Arabic script for Malay known as Jawi.  Outside of government signage and religious publications almost all signs use the Roman alphabet.\nThe ethnic Chinese community in Brunei continues to speak a variety of Chinese languages, including Hokkien, Teochew, and several others. Mandarin is taught in Chinese schools, so most ethnic Chinese are conversant in it as well.\nTourist sites always have signage in English, and often in Chinese as well due to the large numbers of Chinese tourists.\n\n\nGet in\n\nCompared to other nations in South East Asia, Brunei's visa policy is a bit more restrictive. \n\n\nEntry requirements\n\nAll foreign nationals must fill out an online arrival form prior to their arrival in Brunei.\nForeign nationals of the following countries/territories can enter Brunei visa-free as long as they present a passport valid for at least 6 months:\nFor up to 90 days: All European Union member states, British citizens and subjects with right of abode in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, United States\nFor up to 30 days: Malaysia, New Zealand, Oman, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates\nFor up to 14 days: Cambodia, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Macau, Maldives, Myanmar, Peru, Russia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam\nNationals of Israel are not allowed to enter Brunei, though other passports containing Israeli stamps and visas are not a problem for entry.\nCitizens of Australia and Bahrain can obtain a visa on arrival (single or multiple entry) for 30 days. Citizens of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can get a single-entry, 30-day visa on arrival. Citizens of China, Qatar and Taiwan can obtain a visa on arrival for 14 days. These citizens can obtain a visa on arrival for $20 or a 3-day transit visa for $5. Immigration officers at Sungai Tujoh Checkpoint between Miri and Kuala Belait will not accept payment for a visa on arrival other than in Brunei or Singapore dollars \u2014 there is no ATM and cheques are not accepted.  At Brunei airport payment must also be made in cash.  There is a money changer (with reasonable rates), but no ATM prior to immigration. If you need a visa-on-arrival, make sure you join the right queue at entry.  Joining the foreign passport queue will see you sent to the back of the line.  Large tour groups requiring visas on arrival can jam up the system.  You may have to be quick, persistent or patient.\nProof of return or onward travel is officially required to check in for your flight to Brunei. If you are leaving overland, for example via Kuala Belait and onwards to Miri, then your flight out of Miri is acceptable. If you plan to leave by ferry you will need to purchase a cheap flight out of Brunei before you arrive there. Alternatively, you can book an expensive (but fully refundable) flight, and cancel it afterwards.\nFrom Kuala Lumpur, Air Asia is not enforcing this rule; hence you probably won't need such a proof of return if you fly from KL.\nThose who need a visa must apply in advance at a Brunei embassy, where processing can take up to 3 days and costs $20 for a single entry visa. See Brunei Immigration Department for the latest details.\n\n\nBy plane\n\n1 Brunei International Airport (BWN  IATA). This is Brunei's sole airport of significance and the hub of national carrier Royal Brunei Airlines (RBA). The airport is compact, immaculate and functional.There are cafes airside and landside, and customs and immigration are smooth. There are additional fast food restaurants outside of arrivals. There are ATMs landside at departures, but none airside or at arrivals.RBA offers a reasonably comprehensive network, with daily flights from London, Dubai, Brisbane, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Kota Kinabalu, and four times weekly non-stop flights from Kuching. Fares that transit via Brunei are attractively priced and you are guaranteed service with a smile. Singapore Airlines flies 5 times a week from Singapore. Budget airline AirAsia provide flights from Kuala Lumpur at as low as US$35 one-way. For other destinations the best transit airports are Singapore Changi and Kuala Lumpur.   \nGetting there/away: A taxi to Bandar Seri Begawan downtown takes 20 minutes and costs around $25. A covered walk down to the end of the car park further away from the Terminal (turn right from Arrivals) leads to a bus stop for Purple buses to the city centre ($1) that only run during the day.\nIf flights to Brunei are full or expensive, an alternative is flying to nearby Miri in Malaysia and taking the bus to Brunei instead (3 hours).\n\n\nBy car\nYou can drive into Brunei from Sarawak, Malaysia. There are two entry points for the main part of Brunei, one from Miri at Sungai Tujuh and one from Limbang at Kuala Lurah (Tedungan on the Malaysian side). Both these crossings have drive-through immigration checkpoints at the border but queues can be horribly long, especially during weekends.\nIt is also possible to drive from the Sarawak towns of Limbang and Lawas to the Temburong district of Brunei. A bridge across the Pandaruan River was opened in December 2013 and the ferry service has been discontinued. Immigration is conducted at Pandaruan (Malaysia side) and at Puni (Brunei side). From Lawas (which is connected by road to Kota Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia), another bridge completes the connection between the banks of the Trusan River (and no ferry ride is required anymore). Malaysian immigration formalities are done in Trusan (the Mengkalap immigration checkpoint is in a shoplot just east of the ferry crossing) about 8 km away, and no longer in Lawas. Those for Brunei can be done at the Labu checkpoint at the border.\nIt is possible to drive from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah to Bandar Seri Begawan in one day. See the Kota Kinabalu to Brunei by land page for details.\nOnly some petrol stations in the country are permitted to sell petrol to cars with non-Brunei plates due to a tax issue. It can be frustrating to find these stations and so ensure your car is topped up.\nThe toll-free Friendship Bridge connects the two borders at the eastern side of Limbang.\n\n\nBy bus\nFrom Miri: As of 2022, there is no direct service between Miri and Bandar Seri Begawan. PHLS Express used to operate a service between Miri and Bandar Seri Begawan twice a day. The easiest option to get from Miri to Brunei is to book a private car or shuttle, which can be done for around B$60. You can do it yourself by booking a taxi or Grab from Miri to the Malaysian border, walking to the Brunei border (1km), and then booking a rideshare/taxi when in Brunei to BSB or Kuala Belait. Dart is the most common rideshare app in Brunei.\nFrom Limbang: There are no direct buses between Bandar Seri Begawan and Limbang in Sarawak. However, you can catch a local bus from Bandar's bus station to Kuala Lurah on the border, walk across the checkpoint into Tedungan in Sarawak and catch a Syarikat Bas Limbang bus to Limbang. Do the reverse if coming from Limbang to Bandar. Buses depart from Limbang bus terminal several times a day and bear the destination \"Batu Danau\". Taxis are also available on both sides of the border but bargain hard for the fare. You can also get to Temburong district by bus from Limbang, although again, there are no direct buses into Bangar; all buses (destination \"Pandaruan\") stop at the ferry landing at Pandaruan, where there is now a Malaysian immigration checkpoint. Cross the river by ferry and catch a taxi for the 5 km to Bangar.\nFrom Kota Kinabalu: Sipitang Express runs buses once a day between BSB (Gadong Night Market) and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.\n\n\nBy boat\nThe main ferry terminal in Brunei is the Serasa Ferry Terminal at Muara, some 25 km from Bandar Seri Begawan.  See Bandar Seri Begawan#By boat for details about the terminal.\nLabuan Ferry operates services from Labuan, taking around 2 hours. As of April 2023, two ferries are operating on most days, one at 8:30am and another at 1.00pm or 4:30pm, with schedules changing on short notice. With a change of boats in Labuan, you can even make it to/from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, in a day. See the Kota Kinabalu to Brunei by land page.\n\n\nGet around\n\nUse caution when asking locals for transportation information. People here are friendly and very helpful, but when asking about transportation, you'll get three different answers from three different people, even people whose job it is to help tourists.\n\n\nBy car\nThere is one \"motorway\", from Bandar Seri Begawan (the capital) along the coast. It is almost all dual carriageway from Muara to Kuala Belait and the toll bridge to Malaysia/Sarawak in the west.\nThere is also a side road off this, which runs into the jungle towards the settlement of Labi and beyond. Excellent scenery, and a 4-wheel drive may be useful, but the road is now sealed up to the longhouses some distance beyond Labi. Stock up on water at the convenient shop at the junction.\nDriving between Temburong and the rest of Brunei used to require passing through Malaysian territory, and clearing Malaysian customs and immigration, but since the completion of the Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Bridge in 2020, that is no longer necessary.\n\n\nBy taxi\nThere are not many taxis in Brunei, because car ownership and usage are high. There are always some at the airport and some in the Belait District, but little chance of finding a free taxi along the road, especially during morning and afternoon peak hours when they are hired by businessmen. Needing a taxi might require a phone call. The main taxi stand is direct north of the bus station in the capital with only a few taxis waiting.\nNone of the taxis has a taxi meter since there is no taxi company nor regulation requiring to have one. Drivers have fixed prices for most trips, although the tariffs may vary between different drivers, or they will give a price for an irregular trip.\n\n\nBy ride-hailing\nThe main ride-hailing app in Brunei is Dart. Well-known ride-hailing apps found elsewhere in Southeast Asia, such as Grab and Gojek, do not operate in Brunei.\n\n\nBy tour vans\nAnother alternative is hiring a tour van to drive you around Brunei, for example, for a whole day, or several hours. Try asking them from the ferry counters in Muara. Discuss the price first before agreeing to board the van.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nWaterways\n209 km; navigable by craft drawing less than 1.2 m. Water taxis are available in the capital.\n\n\nBy bus\nAround the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, there is a good-sized network of minibuses. Brunei's high rate of private car ownership means very few Bruneians take these buses, which largely cater to foreign workers. The speed of the buses is limited to 50 km/h but are quite efficient and reliable.\nIn general, the bus system around the capital radiates from the bus terminal in the central district. There are designated bus stops along each route but passengers are picked up or let off at unofficial locations at the discretion of the driver. The unofficial mode of operation makes easy travel and entices patronage. There are maps of the bus routes at the terminal. Routes are numbered and the buses are different colors depending on the route. The fare is $1 which is normally collected by a conductor but may also be collected by the driver. The passenger can advise the driver the location to disembark. The buses run every 20\u201340 minutes from about 06:00 to 18:00. Sometimes, the conductor asks the passengers their respective locations to disembark and skips part of the route, to the dismay of passengers who wish to catch the bus. The buses run roughly every 20\u201340 minutes from 06:00 to 18:00, but there's no strict schedule. It is quite normal to wait 30 to 45 minutes for a bus.\nThere is also an infrequent long-distance bus which runs between BSB and Seria through Tutong.\n\n\nBy thumb\nHitchhiking is doable in Brunei \u2013 drivers are very willing to stop.\n\n\nSee\nUlu Temburong National Park in Temburong\nThe Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque in Bandar Seri Begawan\nBandar Seri Begawan has a couple of museums dedicated to the history of Brunei and that of the monarchy.\n\n\nDo\n\nFor things to do in and in the near vicinity of Bandar Seri Begawan, see Bandar Seri Begawan.\nThere are many eco-tours which typically go to the Temburong district by boat then to a native \"longhouse\". It is then followed by a powered boat (by the natives) up the river to the Belalong reserve in the Borneo rainforest.  There is a canopy walk and research centre at the park headquarters.\nJerudong Park was once a decent theme park with a multitude of rides. Sadly, a downward cycle of neglect, declining admission and unaffordable maintenance costs led to the closure and sale of most of the big-ticket rides, including the three roller coasters. This has given the park a sad \"circus left town last week\" air about it. Most people who visit only go at night to avoid the heat during the day. Outside the park, but very close, is a small complex of restaurants which is open at night, though only a few of the stalls are still operational. The local papers have reported plans to renovate the park with a new selection of attractions.\n\n\nScuba diving\nBrunei offers some great diving. In addition to coral and fish, Brunei is home to several shipwrecks and many species of nudibranch (often spectacularly colourful molluscs)- one of the best places in SE Asia for macro photography. Water temperature is generally around 30 \u00b0C and visibility is usually around 10-30 metres, although this can be changeable during the monsoon season. As diving here is not overly developed, it means that the sites, and especially the coral reefs, are unspoiled and in pristine condition.\nPopular dive sites include the American Wreck, Admirable Class Minesweeper, USS Salute (AM-294) lies broken in half on a sand bottom at 30m after hitting a Japanese mine on 8 June 1945, during  pre-invasion sweeps of the Brunei Bay, with the loss of nine lives. Australian Wreck, In 1949 while on a voyage to Manila it struck a mine off Brunei and sank. The wreck lies in 33 m of water and is roughly 85 m. Dolphin 88 Wreck Malaysian commercial vessel sunk in bad weather in 2013. Experienced divers will enjoy exploring the interior of the wreck. Oil Rig Wreck, a decommissioned oil rig. There are 9 structures to be explored, each seeming to be home to one dominant group of fish. Baiei Maru Wreck was a Japanese oil tanker that sank in October 1944 in Brunei Bay after hitting a Japanese mine. Discovered by the Brunei Shell Petroleum during a survey, the wreck sits in about 50 m of water. Other dive sites includes Labuan Wreck, Bolkiah Wreck, UBD Wreck, Amai Wreck, Arun Wreck, Stone Wreck to name a few.\nDiving is very reasonable, averaging out to $35-45 per dive depending on how many dives you do and whether you bring your own gear. There are a number of organisations you can do trips with such as; Poni Divers,Oceanic Quest, The Brunei Sub Aqua Dive Club in Brunei-Muara & Panaga Divers based in Seria.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe local currency is the Brunei dollar, denoted by the symbol \"$\" or \"B$\" (ISO code: BND).  You might hear ringgit used to refer to the dollar but be sure that the speaker is not talking about the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) which is valued at less than a third of a Brunei dollar. All prices in this guide are in Brunei dollars unless otherwise noted.\nThe Brunei dollar is tied to the Singapore dollar at a 1:1 rate.  By law the currencies can be used interchangeably, so if you're coming in from Singapore, there's no reason to change money as your cash will be readily accepted. (Likewise, any leftover Brunei dollars can be used at par in Singapore.) However, many stores refuse Singapore notes with seemingly microscopic tears in them, and notices to this effect are posted at the cash register. Malaysian ringgit (RM) will also be accepted in a pinch, but the exchange rate may not be in your favour. The ringgit is not available at Brunei banks but can be obtained from money changers.\nThe Brunei dollar is divided into 100 cents.  There are banknotes from $1 to a whopping $10,000 (handy if you're shopping for Rolls-Royces) and coins of 1-50 cents. All smaller notes and the 2004 series of larger notes are printed as brightly coloured polymer notes.\n\n\nCosts\nBy Southeast Asian standards Brunei is roughly on par with Singapore, meaning roughly twice as expensive as neighbouring Malaysia. You can reduce costs by eating at local restaurants and avoiding the more expensive restaurants in hotels. Budget accommodation is available.\n\n\nSouvenirs\nThere is not much of a local crafts industry in Brunei.  You'll see a handful of different types of branded souvenirs with the Brunei brand - that are all imported.  Souvenir type shops usually resort to selling imported curiosities, candles and generic gifts.\n\n\nEat\nMain article: Cuisine of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei\n\nBruneians love to eat out and there are many excellent restaurants in Brunei serving a wide variety of cuisines, thanks to the large number of foreign workers in the country.\nThere is also the local nasi katok, a simple combination of rice and curried beef or chicken, which can be quite spicy. It is relatively inexpensive when compared to other food that you can buy, for example local food such as chicken rice. However, it is not a healthy option, with few vegetables and too much fat.\nAnother choice is ambuyat, a culinary experience unique to Borneo. It is a starchy and gooey paste made from sago that can be dipped into a savoury sauce.\nBeing a Muslim country, nearly all food sold in Brunei is halal, the exception being food stalls and restaurants catering to the ethnic Chinese community, which have been granted special permission to sell pork. Halal certification is handled by the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) (Kementerian Hal Ehwal Ugama (KHEU)).\nVegetarians should look for South Asian restaurants serving the large community of foreign workers. Another option is Chinese Buddhist vegetarian restaurants, as many ethnic Chinese in Brunei go on vegetarian fasts for specific Buddhist festivals. These can mainly be found in the suburbs of Bandar Seri Begawan, but you will need to make an effort to seek them out. Chinese Buddhist vegetarian restaurants are also the safest bet for vegans, as they traditionally do not use dairy products, but make sure your dish does not contain eggs.\nIt is illegal to eat in public during daylight hours in Ramadan, and most stalls and restaurants will be closed during the day. However, Chinese restaurants are permitted to remain open and sell takeaway meals to non-Muslims for consumption in private.\nKosher food is basically non-existent in Brunei.\nDesserts\n\nKueh melayu (sugar, raisin, and peanut-filled sweet pancakes)\n\n\nDrink\n\nBrunei is a dry country: alcohol is not sold anywhere in the country and consumption of alcohol in public is prohibited by law. That said, non-Muslims are allowed to bring in up to two litres of alcohol (wine or spirits) plus up to twelve cans of beer every 48 hours for private consumption, and there is a wide array of duty-free shops just across the border in Malaysia to cater to this demand. However, alcohol must be declared upon arrival in Brunei while going through customs. There are also numerous bars and nightclubs in Tedungan just across the border in Malaysia's Limbang district, Sarawak, which is where many Bruneians go for a good night out.\nMany higher-end restaurants allow guests to bring in their own alcohol and corkage is not charged, though this is actually illegal and it's best to keep a low profile if you choose to consume in a public establishment. At the lower end (particularly Chinese restaurants), many restaurants supply illicit booze under euphemisms like \"special tea\".\nOne should definitely try out teh tarik, a sweet milk tea, as well as the wide array of coffee (kopi) available in restaurants.\n\n\nSleep\nAccommodation in Brunei used to be very expensive, but some reasonably cheap guesthouses and hostels can now be found here and there. See Bandar Seri Begawan for listings.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nBrunei is a very safe country, with low crime rates and no major security concerns. Brunei has a strict legal system \u2015 which combines British common law and Sharia law \u2015 that punishes crime severely, adding a huge layer of deterrence. The full harshness of Brunei's laws is reserved for criminals and those actually looking for trouble. \nBrunei, like Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, has very strict laws when it comes to drugs. Drug trafficking to a certain degree has a mandatory death sentence. Other crimes, such as murder, kidnapping and unauthorised possession of firearms are also punished with death. While an informal moratorium of capital punishment exists, offenders should still expect life imprisonment or a long prison term. Brunei uses caning (for males only) for rapes, as well as for less serious crimes, including illegal entry, overstaying your visa for over 90 days, robbery, corruption and vandalism. Caning is no slap on the wrist. Strokes from the thick rattan cane are excruciating. They can take weeks to heal, and even scar for life. These laws apply to foreigners as well.\nIn theory, offences such as rape, adultery, sodomy, robbery and insult or defamation of the Prophet Muhammad carry the maximum penalty of death, though this is not enforced. Homosexuality carries a penalty of 40 strokes of the cane and/or a maximum of 10 years in jail. The punishment for theft that exceeds a certain amount is amputation. Those who \"persuade, tell or encourage\" Muslim children under the age of 18 \"to accept the teachings of religions other than Islam\" are liable to a fine or jail. (These laws mostly apply to Muslims, though some aspects apply to non-Muslims.) Homosexuality and adultery are illegal in Brunei, and can result in being stoned to death.\nDuring the Islamic month of Ramadhan, avoid consumption of food and beverages in public as a hefty fine in the thousands will be levied if caught doing so. Additionally, all restaurants, including non-halal ones, cease dine-in services during the day. It is best to avoid visiting Brunei during Ramadhan.\nDriving in Brunei is easy. Most drivers obey the traffic rules, and the roads are well maintained. Distances are not great. If you're driving around Brunei, however, do watch out for impatient and/or dangerous drivers. Some drivers obviously consider themselves above the law, and given the social structure of Brunei, this is likely to actually be the case. Take extra caution around midnight and early morning as some drivers illegally race on the roads.\nPublic celebration of non-Muslim religious festivals such as Christmas and Easter is illegal in Brunei. It is still legal to celebrate them in private, so long as the celebrations are kept secret from Muslims.\n\n\nStay healthy\nEating out is generally safe because of good food safety standards. But drink water only if it's been boiled, or bottled water. Protect yourself from mosquito bites. Dengue fever is a real risk.  Malaria risk is low.\nBrunei's hospitals are generally adequate for most routine procedures. However, due to the lack of specialists, you may need to be airlifted to Singapore if your case requires complicated surgical procedures; ensure that your insurance covers this if you plan to be in Brunei.\n\n\nRespect\n\nThe Brunei Government is run as a Malay Islamic Monarchy (Melayu Islam Beraja) principle, which means that the Sultan of Brunei, apart from being one of the richest men in the world, effectively runs the country.  You can expect the Sultan to appear on the front page of the two local daily newspapers almost every day, and occupy the first ten minutes of the local TV news bulletins.\nYou'll see the wealth of the country in everything that the Sultan touches, but much of the rest of the country misses out on badly needed investment and development.  Over half of the country are expatriate workers or permanent residents, and it's not hard to engage them in a conversation about the political situation once you gain their trust.  Brunei is a country where your race, religion and heritage matter in day-to-day life. Still, it's best to approach the subject very carefully, especially with Bruneians. \nThe Bruneian Royal Family is protected by l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws; speaking out against them or making fun of them is a crime and will culminate in a prison sentence. \nBruneians are generally courteous and tolerant.  Non-Muslim visitors are generally not restricted in their manner of dress. Women can wear sleeveless shirts and shorts and blend in, and are not legally required to wear the hijab, known locally as the tudung. Super-skimpy swimming attire is probably one step too far.\nIt is a good idea to keep your ideas to yourself on politics (domestic, regional, or international) and world events, particularly those relating to Islam or Islamic countries, but most Bruneians are more than happy to discuss the role their religion and royalty play in their lives if you listen respectfully.\nLike in Malaysia, you'll often be expected to take your shoes off in Brunei, in places like hostels, museums, and mosques. Wear socks if you want, and be grateful for the opportunity to cool off your feet after walking around in the tropical heat.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nBy phone\nThe international code for Brunei is 673. The telephone numbers in Brunei consist of 7 digits with no local codes, although the first digit of the number indicates the area such as 3 for the Belait District and 2 for Bandar Seri Begawan.\nThe prepaid Hallo Kad, available from TelBru telephone offices (including one at the airport) and other outlets in denominations from $5-50 can be used at any phone in the country to make local and international calls.  Other phone cards are also available for use in public phones.\nMobile phone services are provided by two network operator DST e Progresif Cellular. Coverage is completed across almost all of the country.  Coverage in the  Temburong national park areas may be patchy.",
