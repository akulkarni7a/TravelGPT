In Portuguese, the word \"bay\" is translated \"baia\". Salvador, Bahia's capital, was founded by Portuguese explorers in 1549. The city lays on a peninsula located in between \"All Saints Bay\" and the Atlantic Ocean. Every time people talked about Salvador, they referred to it as, \"the province with the bay in it\". Later on, the province would be officially named \"The Province of Bahia\" (the province of the bay). The spelling of the word \"bay\" (baia) was changed in order to make the province's name unique. Salvador-Bahia became Brazil's first capital back when the country was one of Portugal's colonies, and remained like that for 214 years (until it was transferred to Rio, and finally to Brasilia).\n\n\nTalk\nBahians, like all Brazilians, speak Portuguese. The accent, however, is different from that of other regions of the country.\nToday due to tourism expansion there are some people who speak English in tourist areas and hotels, but since it is not widely spoken, if you do not speak Portuguese you would be wise to bring a small travel dictionary.\n\n\nGet in\nInternational Airports in Bahia:\n\nSalvador (SSA IATA), connecting flights to Lisbon, Frankfurt, Miami, Buenos Aires and Madrid.\nPorto Seguro, connecting flights to Lisbon and Buenos Aires.\nDomestic Airports with Scheduled Flights in Bahia:\n\nIlheus (IOS), with nonstop flights to Salvador, S\u00e3o Paulo, Campinas, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Seguro and Vitoria.\nVitoria da Conquista (VDC), with nonstop flights to Salvador, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.\nBarreiras (BRA), with nonstop flights to Salvador and Brasilia.\nIlha de Comandatuba (UNA), with nonstop flights to Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo.\nPaulo Afonso (PAV), with nonstop flights to Maceio.\nGuanambi (GNM), with nonstop flights to Salvador and Bom Jesus da Lapa\nLencois (LEC), with nonstop flights to Salvador\nBom Jesus da Lapa (LAZ), with nonstop flights to Salvador and Guanambi.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\nCoach services are comfortable and cheap.
