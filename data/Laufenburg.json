  "extract": "Laufenburg is a town on the River Rhine. Because the Rhine is the border, part of the town is in northwestern Switzerland and another part is in the German Black Forest . The combined population of the twin towns is about 6200 people.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe two parts of the town are officially two different places; Laufenburg (Kanton Aargau) and Laufenburg (Baden), sometimes called Gross-Laufenburg and Klein-Laufenburg (Great Laufenburg and Little Laufenburg). This strange situation dates back to the Napoleonic wars. Before that, both sides of the Rhine were Austrian territory. The former Austrian province was divided in two along the Rhine, the north Bank going to the Duchy of Baden, and the south bank to the Kanton of Aargau. Ever since then there have been two Laufenburgs.\n\n\nGet in\nLaufenburg has two railway stations on opposite sides of the Rhine, one belonging to DB (German railways) and one to SBB (Swiss Railways). The Swiss station has hourly direct trains from Basel (Swiss Station). The German station has hourly direct trains from Basel (German Station) and from Waldshut (change here for Z\u00fcrich). Some of the trains go through to Schaffhausen, Singen, Friedrichshafen and Ulm. If you arrive from Basel the Swiss train is usually somewhat cheaper but the view from the German side makes it the preferable choice. Post buses also connect Laufenburg with Aarau, Brugg and Frick. The roads leading to Laufenburg also go along the banks of the Rhine. Nearby airports are EuroAirport (Basel) and Z\u00fcrich.\n\n\nGet around\nLaufenburg is small. You can walk all around it, including across the border.\n\n\nSee\nMost attractions concentrate in the old town with its magnificent colourful houses along the Rhine and the small alleys. Most of old Laufenburg is on the Swiss side, but you can also simply cross the bridge to Little Laufenburg on the German side. Usually there are no passport controls on the bridge.\nSpecial buildings are both town halls, the Court of Justice, St. John Church with the panoramic hill near it, Church of the Holy Spirit and the miniature Codman Castle.\nMuseums:\n\n1 Museum Schiff, Fluhgasse 156, \u260f +41 62 874 22 43, info@museum-schiff.ch.
