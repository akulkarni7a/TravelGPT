  "extract": "Ghent (Dutch: Gent, French: Gand) is a city in East Flanders in Belgium. Ghent is a city with a population of 265,000 in 2020, with rich history. During the Middle Ages, Ghent was one of the richest and most powerful cities in Europe. The impact of this rich past can be clearly seen when viewing the imposing architecture of churches and the houses of rich traders. The city centre is restored, and breathes the atmosphere of a thriving late-medieval city state. It is free of cars, so it is a very welcoming and open area. \n\n\nUnderstand\n\nGhent was once considered the second largest city north of the Alps, after Paris. It has a relatively high proportion of young people, and a significant seasonal student population.  Unlike Leuven, another university town in Flanders, youth is not the only category of people living there. There is an interesting mixture of foreigners who came to live there, professionals working for major international firms, and artists among the people of Ghent. This mixture makes the people more tolerant and open-minded. This atmosphere seeps into every aspect of city life, making the city different from the smaller provincial cities or the bigger city of Antwerp.\n\nVisit Ghent website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nGhent is a 30-minute train ride away from Brussels and is on the line from Brussels to Bruges and the coast. If you're planning to visit Bruges and Brussels, definitely stop over in Ghent as well. There are also direct trains to Brussels Airport (BRU IATA), Antwerp, and Lille.\nThe main station is 1 Gent-Sint-Pieters.   . It is the main station, to go to the centre, take tram  1  (until 2 Korenmarkt. ). Journey time is ten minutes. 3 Gent-Dampoort.  is closer to the center (about 15 minutes walk), but only trains coming from the direction of Antwerp stop there.\nTrip planning and ticket purchase can be done on the SNCB website or the SNCB app.\n\n\nBy car\nThe dense highway network in Belgium allows you to access Ghent easily by car. Two main highways E40 (Li\u00e8ge-Brussels-Ghent-Bruges-Ostend) and E17 (Antwerp-Ghent-Kortrijk-Lille) cross at Ghent. Brussels and Antwerp are 40 min away, Bruges 30 min. During rush hour you can easily double these times.\n\n\nBy plane\nThe two biggest airports nearby are Brussels (Zaventem, Belgium) and Lille (France). Direct trains are available from Brussels Airport to Ghent. Brussels-South airport, in Charleroi, is farther away, but popular due to the large number of flights (mainly Ryanair).\n\n\nBy boat\nDFDS operates a cargo line to Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nThe centre of Ghent is quite small, so you can walk around on foot. However, the main station (Gent Sint-Pieters) is not in the city centre, but takes a walk of about half an hour. The best option is to take the tram, which takes you directly to the centre in 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nA bicycle is the recommended way to get around in Ghent. However, there are many roads with cobblestones that make cycling a shaking experience. Also make sure you stay clear of the tram rails. Nevertheless, you will see you are not alone on your bike: many inhabitants use bikes to get around. Even the former mayor uses his bicycle all day. There are many bike stands around to make it easy to lock your bike (important!) Many one-way roads are made two-way for bikes.\n\n\nBy public transportation\nThe transport system is Ghent is excellent and usually on time.  The transportation company is De Lijn. A single ticket costs \u20ac2.50 if bought in the bus or tram (contactless only from white card reader) or from ticket machines near stops. Such a ticket is valid for an hour's travel on all trams and buses.  If you are planning to stay for a while, either buy a three day pass for \u20ac15 or 10 trips for \u20ac17 \u2014 they are valid for within the city and can also be used throughout Flanders (e.g. Antwerp or Bruges). The trams are the quickest and most comfortable way to travel, especially from the railway station to the city centre. There are 3 tram lines  1 , 2  &  4 .\nThere is a De Lijn app available for Android or IOS smartphones which offer journey planning, real time travel info and ticket purchase in English. \nTickets purchased on a card should be validated on the reader (not the white one) when entering the bus/tram while tickets purchased on the website or app should be validated before entering the vehicle. With a few exceptions, the tickets are usable throughout Flanders.\nIn the Lijnwinkel kiosk, near Sint-Pieters train station, you can get a free map of city and surroundings, with all bus and tram lines. \n\n\nSee\n1 Belfort en Lakenhalle (Belfry and Cloth Hall), Emile Braunplein (tram 1 or 4 to Sint-Baafsplein), \u260f +32 9 223 99 22.

It is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, attracting about 2 million visitors every year.

Young up-and-coming bands and arises get their chance in the intimate \"mirror tent\" in that same parc. The Beverhoutplein is taken over by French chanson. The roots of the festival are at the Sint-Jacobs square, where you can find Belgian and world artists, blues and rock music. Last-but-not-least in this non-exhaustive list is Vlasmarkt, where the party literally (i.e. not figuratively) never ends. It defies description and comparison and needs to be experienced to be understood. And for once these are not idle words. Party until long after the sun comes up and get a botram me uufflakke or sjoko (a sandwich with meat or chocolate paste). Besides this musical programme, the city's cultural houses and organisations open their doors. There are theatre and comedy shows, puppetry and workshops for kids and adults alike, exhibitions, guided tours and many random street acts such as mimickers, buskers, etc. Additionally a number of festivals within the festival are held, like Ghent Jazz for jazz music, 10 Days Off for electronic music and Boomtown for the most traditional music festival atmosphere, all three consistently having an impressive and international line-up.
