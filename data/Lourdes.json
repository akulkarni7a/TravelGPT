  "extract": "Lourdes is a town in the Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es of France. It is a global centre of Marian pilgrimage, receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Many Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, appeared 18 times at the Grotto to a young girl, Saint Bernadette Soubirous.\nOriginally a sleepy market town on the road to the spas of the Pyrenees, Lourdes has grown into the largest Marian pilgrimage centre in the world. The town has two sections: the international portion by the river, consisting of the spiritual area containing the Grotto and churches (known as the Domaine or the Sanctuaries), and the \"French\" portion, centred around the marketplace & Hotel de Ville.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nIn prehistoric times, assorted nomadic tribes had made Lourdes one of their settlements, of which one of their legacies include the still-standing Ch\u00e2teau Fort. The castle was then made into an estate jail throughout the 17th century and again during the Napoleon era.\nLourdes was the victim of a number of power struggles. In the 8th century, skirmishes erupt between Mirat, the local leader of the Muslims of Al-Andalus and Charlemagne, King of the Franks. According to legend, an eagle unexpectedly dropped a trout at the feet of Mirat. Seen as a sign of bad omen, Mirat eventually surrendered the fort and converted to Christianity, taking the name Lorus of which was the origin of the name of this city, Lourdes.\nIn the Middle Ages, for 45 years, Lourdes belonged to England as France surrendered from the Hundred Years War. In 1405, King Charles VI launched an operation to capture the city in an 18-month siege. The next century, the town witnessed another conquest between the Roman Catholics, the Protestants, and the Huguenots; the former of which eventually won and claimed the town in 1592.\nUntil the apparition of the Virgin Mary in 1858, Lourdes was just a sleepy town of 4,000 residents and a transit town for tourists hiking into the Pyrenees.\n\n\nThe Apparition of Mary\nOn 11 February 1858, 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous along with her sister, Toinette, and a friend named Jeanne were gathering firewood near the grotto at Massabielle when the former heard the sound of a gushing wind. Lifting her head, she saw a small lady, bathed in light, looking at her and smiling. This would be followed by a near-daily apparition for 17 times until that July. Progressively, the whole town believed the story. The grotto was soon barricaded however, as reportedly 9,000 people witness the 15th apparition, but was reopened by the order of Emperor Louis Napoleon III that October.\nThe effects of the apparition are certainly enormous, especially after the Catholic Church confirmed the apparitions in 1870. A shrine was built there and was soon designated as one of the pilgrimage destinations of Roman Catholics around the world. People also take home or bathe in its spring water which is believed to have healing effects. The term Immaculate Conception was said by Mary as she introduced herself to Bernadette. As for Bernadette, she entered into a religious order 8 years later, settled in Nevers and is celebrated as one of the saints of the Church.\n\n\nClimate\nLourdes is mainly mild, especially compared to Paris or northern France, and relatively rainy, regardless of the season. That said sunny or partly cloudy days can be especially easier to be found in the summer. Winter is usually cool though nighttime temperatures below 0\u00b0C are not unheard of and can last for a couple days.\n\n\nGet in\nThere are several trains and buses connecting Lourdes to other French cities. It is also easily accessible by car, and close to the border with Spain.\n\n\nBy car\nLourdes is about 9 hours from Paris via Toulouse and the A64. Lourdes is easily accessed by car, although the narrow streets around the holy sites can become quite congested at weekends and holy days. Roads from the Southwest of France and from Spain are also good. On your GPS, make sure that you put the silent s with no apostrophe or you may end up in a village far away (there are several of them). Many foreigners make mistakes to the amusement of the other villages.\n\n\nBy train\n\nSeveral trains travel to Lourdes, including TGV & night train service from Paris (six and nine hours respectively) and Tarbes in addition to intercity trains from Pau, Bayonne/Biarritz, and Toulouse. The small SNCF station offers minimal services, but there are free toilets, a small coffee/pastry counter, vending machines, and an adjacent cafe and quick service restaurant (service can be rather surly, even for France).  Accessibility is excellent due to the large number of infirm and disabled pilgrims who visit Lourdes and many trains passing through Lourdes offer special services for the disabled. For information on trains to and from Lourdes, visit the SNCF website.\n\n1 Lourdes railway station (Gare de Lourdes), 33 Avenue de la Gare (a few hundred metres from the town centre, and offers easy access and clear signs to the Domaine area).   (updated Dec 2021)\n\n\nBy coach\nOrganized tour groups from all around the world may have dedicated coaches (and even priests as tour guides) that take them to town. Coach arrivals from Ireland and the UK to Lourdes are charters, run by specific travel agencies or charity organisations for organised pilgrim groups.\nACROSS organises all-inclusive tours every week between Easter and the end of October for those with special needs in the UK.\n\n\nBy plane\nThe nearest airport is 2 Tarbes-Lourdes  (LDE  IATA), approximately twenty minutes' drive from the town itself. Air France and its low-cost subsidiary HOP! operate daily flights from Paris Orly airport, while most other destinations in western and central Europe and the USA's east coast are served by charter flights. During the summer season, Ryanair operates flights from London Stansted and Milan (Bergamo).  Public buses run depending on flight schedules for \u20ac3 one way, in general 2\u00bd hours before departure time from Lourdes (Gare-SNCF, Cire, and Paradis bus stops) and 45 minutes after arrival from the airport.\nThere are other nearby airports with more flights, all of which require a transfer by train to Lourdes at the respective cities' train station:\n\n3 Pau Pyrenees Airport (PUF  IATA). Air France and HOP operate multiple daily flights from both Charles-de-Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris. Pau airport is approximately 40 minutes' drive away from Lourdes; a taxi would cost from \u20ac80 one way.   (updated Mar 2022)\n4 Toulouse-Blagnac (TLS IATA). Toulouse-Blagnac is a bigger airport that is two hours away by car. To take the train to Lourdes, transfer by bus or taxi to Matabiau station.   (updated Mar 2022)\n5 Biarritz Airport (BIQ IATA). Biarritz Airport is accessible from Lourdes by train and has flights from Paris, the UK, and Ireland by Air France, HOP!, Easyjet and Ryanair.   (updated Mar 2022)\n\n\nBy minivan\nIf you arrive in Toulouse there is also the possibility of a transfer by minivan. Some operators, such as Ophorus and Toursud also organize guided day tours to the city.\n\n\nGet around\n\nDue to the small area of the town, most destinations can be reached on foot. Some buses do seasonal runs between the train station and some of the biggest or furthest hotels.\n\n\nOrientation\nThe Gave de Pau river splits the city into two. The east are where most of the shops and hotels are. The west part contains the Sanctuary complex and a number of high-end hotels a short walk away.\nThe downtown area is south of the train station and north of Avenue Marechal Juin. Most shops and restaurants can be found south of, and along the Rue de la Grotte, and west of Avenue G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Baron Maransin.\n\n\nOn foot\nLourdes is a pedestrian-friendly city with several pedestrian only streets and it is very easy to get around the town centre. It really is worth walking and exploring. The town is also used to disabled visitors, help is also readily available.\n\n\nBy car\nLourdes has a complicated one-way street system around town and, because many streets are pedestrian only, it can be confusing and time-consuming getting around town. There are many places to park on the outskirts of the city (especially off the rue de Pau) and walking to the grotto is easy so, if possible, park and walk is the easiest way to get around.\n\n\nBy bus\nLourdes has 5 bus lines that connect the center with the suburbs. Routes L4 and L5 are useful for travel within the old town and the Lourdes Sanctuary Complex.\nEach ride costs \u20ac1.00 regardless of distance.\n\n\nSee\n\nWhile tourists who come here will usually look for ways to immerse in the religiosity, those that need some time out can certainly seek the rich history of the town.\n\n\nLourdes Sanctuary Complex\nThe compound is open from 5:00 to 00:00 daily.\n\n1 Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, 1 Avenue Mgr Th\u00e9as, \u260f +33 5 62 42 78 78.

There are two further images, one on each side of the entrance to the sacristy.   (updated Jul 2018)\n4 Church of St. Bernadette. The most modern church, across the river from the basilicas. It was built on the exact spot where Bernadette stood during the final apparition. (updated Jul 2018)\n5 The Grotto of Massabielle.

There is a historic chateau on a hill visible from the town, as well.\n\n\nReligious events\nIf you're Catholic (or even if you're not), you can go to a Catholic Mass in any of the churches of the City. Unlike Vatican in which most of the service is held in Italian or Latin, you can find Mass held in some of the major languages of the world. And they are of course, free.\nAt the Sanctuary Complex, Masses are offered by the church or visiting pilgrimage groups in various languages throughout the day at many locations. Simply look at the TV screens at the main entrance, in front of the information center, and the baths for the schedule.\n\n Holy Water. Daily 06:00-00:00.

There is also a water fountain behind the taps if you wish to drink it directly or to also fill up your container, but they also have low pressure. free.

If items like these are your thing, the large Palais du Rosaire offers an enormous selection and will wrap items for you to take home. Rue de la Grotte is perhaps the most crowded street in Lourdes as that is where most of Lourdes' stores and restaurants are located.\nMany shops will close for 1\u00bd \u2013 2 hours around lunch; be prepared to be shooed out of the store or hurried along with your purchases if you are shopping around 12:30. On Sundays, a few shops and supermarkets should remain open, though maybe with reduced hours and staffing, to take a chance on foot traffic to or from the churches.\nShops often have flags or signs outside indicating the languages (besides the obvious French, usually English, Spanish, and Italian, although sometimes German and Dutch) spoken there.\n\n1 Les Halles, 11 Place du Champ Commun, \u260f +33 5 62 42 54 11.

Because of the large supply, extremely cheap accommodation can be found, with double rooms in hotels comparable to hostel prices (for example, \u20ac40 for a double room).

Use common sense and street smarts. Pickpockets may be common especially on streets with plenty of pedestrians. Do not leave your stuff unattended.\nAs many attractions may involve queuing, allow extra time and be patient.\n\n\nConnect\nThe code area for Lourdes is 562 with 5 being the code for southwest France. Telephone numbers for the region are usually written as 33 5 62 (the phone number) using two digits after every space.\nAll of the major French telecom companies are supported within the city proper; coverage may be spotty if you are on the rural area of the Pyrenees. However, if you need to call the emergency number (112), by law your call should go through regardless of the telecom company. If you use an international SIM, check your telecom company to see if it has roaming partnerships with France. Alternatively, use a short term SIM card if you will be here for a while.\nThe same operator should also provide fast 4G LTE connection for Internet. WiFi (pronounced Wee-Fee, not Wai-Fai) is usually provided by your hotel and at some restaurants (usually indicated with the @ symbol), but hardly ever at churches; however the point being there for most is to pray, immerse in the liturgical events or talk to fellow pilgrims.\n\n\nGo next\nSaint-P\u00e9-de-Bigorre\nPau\nParc National des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es",
