It offers the traveller a mixture of a typical French night-life, historically rich street-scapes and great shopping opportunities.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nLocated in the French region which was known as Anjou in the Middle Ages, today Angers is a bustling French city, home to around 150,000 people in the city and roughly 270,000 people in the greater metropolitan area. It's a place with great appeal to historians and travelers interested in discovering France's rich medieval history.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\n\nLike most French cities Angers can be easily accessed by motorway. The A11 connects Angers to the French capital Paris and nearby Le Mans. By car Angers lies roughly 295 km west of Paris and 95 km west of Le Mans.\nAngers is also close to Nantes, Tours and Rennes, all of which are connected to Angers by motorway. Many of the motorways charge a toll which can vary from \u20ac2 up to \u20ac25.\n\n\nBy train\nTGV offers frequent rail-links between Angers and many of France's major towns and cities. The trains are generally of a very high quality, offer very comfortable seating and have suitable storage spaces for luggage. Trains are quite regular and generally depart on time. Ticket checks take place on every journey, as a result it is very important that you are in possession of a valid ticket at all times. Smoking is not permitted anywhere on the train and the use of mobile phones in the seating area of the carriage is frowned upon by other passengers.\nAngers is...\n\nRoughly between 90 minutes and 2 hours from Paris.
