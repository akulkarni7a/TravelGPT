  "extract": "Utrecht is a central Dutch city with a long history. With 362,000 inhabitants (2022), it\u2019s the fourth largest city in the Netherlands. Utrecht is known as a student city with a large population of single young people. This results in a booming nightlife with many places to have a quick meal, some drinks or a dance.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe history of the city goes back to 47 AD when the Roman emperor Claudius ordered his general Corbulo to build a defensive line along the river Rhine which was the northern most border of the empire. One of the strongholds (or Castella) along the river was built at a crossing in the river and was called Traiectum (which means crossing place). In the local language this became Trecht, Uut-Trecht (lower-Trecht) and later Utrecht. On the place where once the castellum stood now stands the Domchurch built in the 13th century.\n\n1 VVV Utrecht Informatie Centrum (Tourist Information Centre), Domplein 9, \u260f +31 30-236 00 04, infovvv@toerisme-utrecht.nl. Daily 10:00-17:00. (updated Aug 2019)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\n1 Utrecht Centraal Station. The hub of the Dutch rail network, it is easily accessible directly, or with one change of train, from almost every station in the Netherlands. For instance, there are frequent direct connections from Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport (even at night), each taking just over 30 minutes for \u20ac10.20 one-way. The high-speed train ICE to Cologne, Frankfurt and Basel stops in Utrecht every two hours.   (updated Nov 2023)\nComing from Germany with the Deutschland-Ticket, take the RE19 e.g. from D\u00fcsseldorf/Duisburg to Arnhem. And then an InterCity (every 15 min) for \u20ac7-12 to Utrecht . (updated Feb 2024)\nThe train station is at the western edge of the old city. A 5-minute walk through the Hoog Catharijne shopping center (follow signs to \u201cCentrum\u201d) will take you from the station to the city or the bus station.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe bus station is next to the train station. International buses depart from the western side of the train station ('Jaarbeurszijde'), exit the railway station on the correct side and turn right to find the busstop next to the NH-Hotel. Flixbus has several lines to Utrecht connecting directly with many European Countries. The international buses to Belgium and Germany are often a cost effective alternative to the trains with longer (Germany) or similar (Belgium) travel duration. The regional and city buses depart from separate stations on the east and west side of the train station. The regional buses are much slower than the trains. For information about the city buses, check the U-OV website, this is the company that provides public transport services in and around the city of Utrecht. Buses to the smaller towns around Utrecht are run by BBA, Arriva and  Connexxion. Time schedules for train and bus can be found  here.\n\n\nBy car\nIf you are coming in by car, park your car in one of the many parking garages around the city (follow the signs) and walk from there. Electronic signs display the number of parking spaces available in any given lot as well as directions to the lot, and if the sign says Vol it means the lot is full. Expect to pay around \u20ac3 to \u20ac5 per hour (as of Aug 2019) at any of the garages in the center. Parking on the curb side is also possible, expect to pay \u20ac3 to \u20ac5 an hour in advance at the meter (as of Aug 2019). Parking fines are around \u20ac70 and frequently enforced, so make sure to get back to your car before the ticket expires. It\u2019s best to avoid driving into central Utrecht. Instead, leave your car at the city perimeter and take a bus or tram into the center.\nThere are 4 Park + Ride (P+R) around the city where you can park your car for the day at a flat rate of \u20ac5 (as of Aug 2019), including transit to the city center by bus or tram for up to 5 passengers. Both bus and trams offer comparable frequency of service. Two P+R facilities are adjacent to tram lines:\n\n2 P+R Westraven, Griffioenlaan (close to the A12 highway exit number 17). The Nieuwegein-Utrecht tram lines 20 & 21 have a stop at P+R Westraven, and both tram lines go to the stop CS Centrumzijde at the central railway station.  (updated Dec 2019)\n3 P+R Utrecht Science Park, Universiteitsweg (adjacent to A28 highway at exit for N412). Tram 22 takes you to city-side of Utrecht Centraal Station.  (updated Dec 2019)\n\n\nGet around\n\nWalking or using a bike is the easiest way to travel in the city of Utrecht.\nTo use the public transportation in the Netherlands, it is recommended to buy an OV-chipkaart. You can buy these on the central bus station (lower level of Utrecht Centraal Station), at kiosks inside the central train station or at some book stores and grocery stores. The OV-chipkaart is valid for bus, train and tram and works like a debit card that you must first charge with an amount.  Buses do take cash though.\n\n\nBy bike\nUsing a bike is the easiest way to travel in the city centre if the weather is on your side. There are many bicycle shops near the train station where you can rent bikes. Alternatively, if you have a personal OV-chipkaart you can rent an OV-Fiets for \u20ac3.85 per 24 hours at one of the rail stations, you have to subscribe to the service for 1 eurocent a year on the NS website first though. Do make sure that you have good locks on your bike, as bike thefts are unfortunately quite common in the city centre. Also it's a good idea to make use of the free bike parking areas provided by the city council. They are usually guarded and are a safe place to park your bike.\nAlso recommended is to do a bike tour. There are several bike tour companies offering guided city tours. There are also cycle routes starting in the centre of Utrecht, which you can download for free: Utrecht Forts Cycle Route.\n\n\nBy bus\nA good alternative is taking the bus, which goes often and will take you nearly everywhere. Utrecht Centraal Station serves as the main bus hub for Utrecht as well as the main train hub for the Netherlands.  Most buses run from early morning (around 06:00) until just after midnight.  City center rides cost ~\u20ac2.50. U-OV operates trams and local buses in and around Utrecht, and has a page in English for visitors.\nIn addition, there are several so-called nightlines. These cost \u20ac5-6 and can\u2019t be paid for using strips or OV-chipkaart.\n\n\nBy public transit\nUtrecht has 3 tram routes all running via the central station (Utrecht Centraal Station a.k.a. Utrecht CS). The station has an underground tram/bus stop named Centrumzijde (meaning downtown side) on the east side of the station. On the station's west side, there is another tram stop named Jaarbeursplein, but visitors are most likely to use Centrumzijde which is nearest to the old city centre. Platforms labelled B at Centrumzijde is for trams. There are 3 tram routes effective July 2, 2022:\n\nTram  20 : Nieuwegein-Zuid \u2013 Utrecht CS \u2013 P+R Science Park\nTram  21 : IJsselstein-Zuid \u2013 Utrecht CS \u2013 P+R Science Park\nTram  22 : Utrecht CS \u2013 P+R Science Park\nFrom Utrecht CS, trams run southwest passing P+R Westraven to Nieuwegein Stadscentrum where the tram line splits into two branches to IJsselstein-Zuid and Nieuwegein-Zuid. The southwest section of the line operates every day to a little past midnight. \nTrams operate from Utrecht CS southeast to P+R Science Park Monday to Friday until 21:30. At these times riders can travel from either IJsselstein-Zuid or Nieuwegein-Zuid to P+R Science Park without switching vehicles. However, there is no weekend or late evening service to P+R Science Park, at which times all trams terminate at Utrecht CS. Use bus line 28 when trams to P+R Science Park are not running. P+R Science Park is in the Uithof district southeast of the centre of Utrecht.\nU-OV operates trams and local buses, and their network can be travelled as cheap as \u20ac6.95 using the U-OV dagkaart. For the rest of the province, a separate \u20ac11.05 off-peak ticket exists. Both tickets offer unlimited access to U-OV buses and trams. The tickets can be bought online or at U-OV ticket machines or service desks. To use the tickets, you must be in the possession of an OV-chipkaart.\n\n\nBy car\nSeeing Utrecht by car is not recommended. The city planners have made it as difficult as possible to navigate the city center, to try and discourage cars there. Driving around can be frustrating as the center is fraught with bus-only lanes, one-way streets, traffic lights and terribly expensive parking spaces. If you want to come by car it is recommended to park at one of the P+R (Park and Ride) places, and take a cheap shuttle bus or tram service into town. There are also several parking garages closer to the center, but they are more expensive.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nAround the Domplein\n\n1 Dom van Utrecht (Domkerk), Achter de Dom 1. May-Sep: M-F 10:00-17:00, Sa 10:00-15:30, Su 12:30-16:00; Oct-Apr: M-F 11:00-15:00, Sa 10:00-15:30, Su 12:30-16:00. The Gothic Dom church (built between 1284 and 1520) is the major religious building in the city. It was a part of a larger cathedral which was partially destroyed by a severe storm while under construction. When a hurricane hit the town in 1674, the badly constructed nave collapsed, which is the reason that today the Domtoren (Bell Tower) and the church itself are separated by the Domplein (Dom Square). The interior of the church was stripped down of every sculpture during Reformation, but the exterior remains a lavishly decorated example of Dutch Gothic architecture.   \n DOMunder, Dom Square (Domplein). guided tours Tu-Su 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30, 16:30.

It is also the highest building in the city by municipal mandate. Climbing up the stairs to see the magnificent view on the top is highly recommended, but beware of the narrow, steep stairs. On clear days you can look as far as Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Home to the second largest set of bells in Europe (after Cologne), and a carillon which is often played by musicians at the weekend. \u20ac9; tickets could also be booked online. (updated Jun 2016)\n3 Pieterskerk. Consecrated in 1048.   (updated Jun 2016)\n4 Stadhuis (City Hall), Korte Minrebroederstraat 2 (at the Oudegracht). It has a rather imposing look.  (updated Jun 2016)\n\n\nOudegracht\nIt is a major canal going through the heart of the city, with shops and restaurants on both sides. This canal is unique because of its many picturesque cellars on water level. Centuries ago they were used for storage and commerce. Nowadays, many of them host fine restaurants and pubs. In the summer you can find nice terraces at the water here.\n\n5 Stadhuisbrug. Perhaps it's the most famous bridge over the Oudegracht. It was created in 1547 by vaulting a space between the older two bridges: the Huidenbrug and the Broodbrug, thus creating one of the major squares in the old town.  (updated Jul 2016)\n6 Kalisbrug. It's another bridge over the Oudegracht which make a small square between Steenweg and Vismarkt. In the middle of the 16th century older 2 bridges \u2013 the Kalisbrug (or Visbrug) and Corduanierbrug \u2013 were connected together making the current Kalisbrug.

(updated Sep 2018)\n\n8 Postkantoor Utrecht (Hoofdpostkantoor), Neude 11. The former Main Post Office is an outstanding and surprising building. The Utrecht main Post Office is a great example of Dutch Art Deco architecture. The Post Office, on the Neude Square, was designed by the architect J. Crouwel and completed in 1924. The barrel-vaulted ceiling is made up of glazed yellow-brick ribs alternated with diagonal glass panes that fill the hall with natural light. The black-and-white floor is set off by five carved black statues set in the walls, each representing a continent. America is a stylized American Indian with two buffalo at his feet. Over the main entrance are magnificent stained glass windows. It was renovated in 2019/2020 and opened for public on 13 March 2020. The impressive central hallway is accessible from the Neude square and offers space for the central library, several restaurants, guarded bicycle parking and a supermarket.   (updated Apr 2020)\n\n9 De Uithof (campus of the Utrecht University). It is a rather strange mix between grey concrete buildings and buildings here that are designed by famous modern architects, like the Educatorium designed by Rem Koolhaas, the University Library and the Minnaert building. There is also a beautiful botanical garden that is 8 acres big, houses 6 thousand different sorts of plants and a Napoleonic fort. Also worth a look: the bicycle track at the Heidelberglaan which is broad enough to function as a two-way car-track. The university campus can be reached from the Central Station by taking tram Line 22.   (updated Jun 2016)\n10 De Inktpot. A notable building with a flying saucer (UFO) on its roof. The saucer is a remnant of the Utrecht art exhibition Panorama 2000, designed by Marc Ruygrok.

Especially near the canals there is a huge choice of places to eat, each with their own style of kitchen, like Italian, Thai, and American.
