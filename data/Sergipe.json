A small strip of tropical rainforest runs down the coast.\nSergipe's economy is focused around the production of sugarcane (for the manufacture of sugar and ethanol), coconut, oranges, and cassava. A small-scale leather and textile industry also exists.\nThe climate is tropical, more humid near the coast, with greater rainfall between March and July, and semi-arid in the sert\u00e3o. On some occasions, the drought in the west of the state can last for almost a year.\n\n\nGet in\nAracaju is the gateway to Sergipe. \n\n\nBy plane\nThere are direct flights to Aracaju International Airport from S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Bras\u00edlia, Salvador, Recife and Macei\u00f3. The airport is 5 minutes from the Atalaia waterfront.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Salvador (325 km to the south) you can take the excellent Linha Verde, whose section in Sergipe is paved; you just need to take the BR 101 in Est\u00e2ncia, 65 km before Aracaju.\nFrom Macei\u00f3 (280 km to the north), you will face the BR 101 the whole time, unless you come by the coastal state road, which in Sergipe starts in Santana do S\u00e3o Francisco and goes to the Federal Highway Police Post in S\u00e3o Francisco, take the ferry to Ne\u00f3polis in Penedo, and only then take BR 101.\n\n\nBy bus\nCompanies with departures from the main capitals of the country to Aracaju:\n\nS\u00e3o Geraldo, tel. 0800-704-3496\nItapemirim, tel. 0800-723-2121\nGuanabara, tel. 85 4005-1992\nBomfim, tel. Aracaju - (79) 3211-2210; Salvador - (71) 3351-5660. 0300 789 8844\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\nS\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o preserves a colonial architectural complex. The town contains churches and religious ensembles dating back to the colonial period. Most of these monuments are concentrated around the S\u00e3o Francisco Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nXing\u00f3 Canyon on the S\u00e3o Francisco river has fascinating landscape, rock formations, crystal-clear waters, ecological trails, Caatinga Theme Park, exuberant vegetation and diversified fauna and flora. The Xing\u00f3 Canyon is located in Canind\u00e9 do S\u00e3o Francisco, on the banks of the lengthy and well-known S\u00e3o Francisco river. It is the world's fifth most navigable river. The river is formed in a valley reaching up to 170 m deep, being 65 km long and at certain locations between 50 and 300 m wide. To navigate between the rocks of this gigantic cliff, embedded in the middle of Sergipe's Alto Sert\u00e3o, is an unforgettable experience. There are imposing valleys forming a 50 m-high canyon, surrounding a lake that, in certain points, reaches a depth of 190 m. Nests of herons and river islands complete the spectacle. The rocks guard traces of the area's first inhabitants who lived there more than 8,000 years ago.\n\n\nDo\nSergipe has an extensive coastline with clear and greenish waters, and white sand. Aracaju stands out for Praia de Atalaia which is considered the beach with the best beach sidewalk in Brazil. Praia do Saco (Est\u00e2ncia) was considered one of the 100 best beaches in the world by the French magazine Les Voyageurs. It had sand dunes and an extensive coastal strip. Praia da Costa (Barra dos Coqueiros), the Delta of the S\u00e3o Francisco River (Brejo Grande), Praia de Pirambu (Pirambu), are other beaches that enhance the state's tourism.\nThe river beaches include the Croa do Gor\u00e9 sandbar and Ilha dos Namorados, which are reached by catamaran on the Vaza Barris River in Aracaju.\n\n\nBuy\nIt is impossible to visit Aracaju without stopping to see local handicrafts and buy souvenirs from the city. In Atalaia there are two options. One of them is the Passarela do Artes\u00e3o, which is behind the skate park. The other is the Tourist Fair, more visible and close to the Hotel da Orla.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
