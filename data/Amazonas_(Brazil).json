  "extract": "Amazonas is a state in the North of Brazil. It is the largest state of Brazil by area. Amazonas' territory is 98% covered by rainforest. The exuberance of the tropical rain forest, associated with hot and humid climate, are responsible for the largest biodiversity on Earth.  The state is known worldwide for its giant rivers and the fascinating Amazon rainforest. The destination offers boat trips along the rivers (including the Meeting of the Waters), direct contact with nature and native peoples, in addition to the typical gastronomy of the region, which brings together a variety of tasty fish and Amazonian fruits.\nThe visitor can count on guided visits to the museums and historical heritage of the cities of Manaus, Parintins, Tef\u00e9 and Itacoatiara, which date back to the Belle \u00c9poque, a time when the Amazon experienced an era of great prosperity with the rubber economy.\n \n\n\nCities\n\n1 Manaus \u2014 the capital of Amazonas state is the chief commercial and cultural center of the upper Amazon region and an important river port\n2 Benjamin Constant \u2014 on the border with Peru, it is in an area inhabited by Ticuna Indians, and has a museum about them\n3 Carauari  \u2014 a town of 29,000 in the Juru\u00e1-Purus moist forests ecoregion\n4 Labrea  \u2014 a town of about 15,000 established during the height of the rubber trade.

Its capital, Manaus, is a bustling modern city right in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. The Amazon Rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world and is of great ecological significance, as its biomass is capable of absorbing enormous amounts of carbon dioxide. Conservation of the Amazon Rainforest is a major global issue. Amazonas is home to the highest mountain in Brazil (Pico da Neblina). Its economy was once reliant almost entirely upon salt; today it has wide and varied industries, including the farming of cassava, oranges, and other agricultural products. It is estimated that the Amazon Region shelters about 2.5 million species of insects, thousands of species of plants, approximately 2,000 species of fish, about 950 species of birds and some 200 species of mammals. It rains a lot from December to May, embellishing the city's waterfalls. For the rest of the year, when there is less rain, fluvial beaches are formed on the Negro River. Amazonas is also the home of around 200,000 Brazilian native Indians.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe Eduardo Gomes International Airport (MAO IATA) receives domestic flights and flights from some Latin America cities, Miami, Orlando and others.\nTabatinga International Airport (TBT IATA)\n\n\nBy car\nRoad access from the south, southwest, midwest, and northeast regions is to Bel\u00e9m, capital of the State of Par\u00e1. From there, the trip takes 96 hours by boat or river ferry to Manaus, over the Par\u00e1 and Amazonas rivers. There is a paved road connecting Manaus to Boa Vista, capital of the State of Roraima, and to Venezuela. In most places in the north, trips are made by boat and by plane using regional airlines. There are also road connections between Manaus and neighboring cities.\n\n\nGet around\nThere are few roads. Most of the time you will have to take a boat or, where possible, fly.\n\n\nSee\nThe Amazon forest. The ecological tourism is the great attraction of the tours through the Amazon. The most sought-after tours include the Reserve of Mamirau\u00e1 and Humait\u00e1, where the greatest attraction is the sport fishing in Roosevelt River. The tours include boat rides, overnight at forest lodges and forest hikes. Most of the tours has a specialized guide.\nMamirau\u00e1 Sustainable Development Reserve. It is one of the largest flooded forest reservations in  the world, with 1.1 million hectares, and  up to 80 continuous kilometers of flooded area. In this reservation, more than 300 species of fishes were identified, including ornamental fish such as the acar\u00e1-disk. In addition, about 400 species of birds and at least 45 species of mammals live in the reservation's area. Among other protected animals is the white uacari monkey (Cacajao calvus calvus), which can only be found in this area. This  reservation  shows important tropical hard wood species such as sumaumeiras and assacus, which  can reach up to 40 meters in length.\nRio Acajatuba. Acajatuba River, a tributary of the Rio Negro (Black River), in the city limit of Iranduba, approximately 41 km (32 miles) away from the capital Manaus. It is near the world's largest complex of river islands, Anavilhanas Archipelago (over 400 islands) and the legendary Boia\u00e7u Bay, which according to the legends, is the home of a gigantic snake. Transportation is mainly through regional boats. It takes approximately 3 hours by boat.\n\n\nDo\nCheck local arts and crafts. The Forest inhabitants and members of Indian tribes produce baskets, hammocks, knick knacks and ornaments using regional seeds, vines, fibers and wood. There are many places, specially in Manaus, where one can find arts and crafts stores.\n\n\nEat\nLocal cuisine is rich and varied and can be found in many  Amazon cities. You may try tapioquinha, a glutinous pancake made from manioc starch, usually buttered and filled with tucum\u00e3 palm fruit and farmer's cheese. Or tacac\u00e1, an Amazon local soup. Or pamonha, made from green corn and coconut milk boiled in corn husks. Or bolo de macaxeira, a tasty but heavy glutinous translucent oily cake made from manioc. Or sugar cane juice, a favorite drink among locals. The region is also known for its exotic fruits like creamy white capua\u00e7\u00fa and iron-rich a\u00e7a\u00ed.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
