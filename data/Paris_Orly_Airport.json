  "extract": "Paris Orly Airport (ORY  IATA) is the second main airport of Paris and second largest airport in France.  It is south of Paris, closer but smaller than Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Besides its role as a domestic hub, it also handles many flights to destinations around the Mediterranean Sea, former colonies or territories like French Guiana, and a few long-haul flights.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThere are four terminals. The former \"Terminal Sud\" (south) is now terminal 4, and the former \"Terminal Ouest\" (west) is now terminal 1 and 2. The terminals are close to each other: a free train service (Orlyval) allows to travel between terminal 1 and 4, but it is also possible to walk about 10 minutes. A new building between these two terminals was opened in 2019, allowing convenient transit throughout the airport.\n\n\nFlights\nCheck with your airline before leaving for the airport.\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are mainly used by the \"major\" European airlines (Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Iberia, TAP...), while terminal 4 is used by secondary, low-cost, or non-European airlines (Air Alg\u00e9rie, Corsair, Norwegian, Transavia, Tunisair, Royal Air Maroc...).\n\n\nGround transportation\n\n\nBy train to Paris\nOpened just in time for the 2024 Paris Olympics, the easiest, cheapest and best option for most visitors is to take Metro Line 14 directly from the airport to Gare de Lyon (21 min) and Ch\u00e2telet-Les Halles (25 min).  A full-fare single ticket is \u20ac10.30 and trains run every 3-5 minutes.\nThe other alternative is taking the Orlyval from either terminal 1 or 4 to Antony station (between 06:00 and 23:00, every 5 to 8 minutes, an 8-minute trip), and from there connect to RER B trains to Paris (every 15 minutes max, any northbound train will stop at every station in Paris, the journey to Denfert-Rocherau takes about 15 minutes, to Chatelet les Halles about 23 minutes). Orlyval costs \u20ac9.30, and a ticket from Orly airport all the way to Paris costs \u20ac12.10 (this ticket allows you to transfer to other RER or metro lines once in Paris). Navigo, Mobilis, or Ticket jeunes, are not accepted on Orlyval (they are although accepted on RER B, as long as they cover at least zones 1-3). Paris Visite is valid on Orlyval.\nAnother option is to take bus 183 from terminal 4 to Pont de Rungis RER station (between 5:00 and 1:30, every 15 minutes, a 10-minute trip), and from there take a RER C train to Paris (every 15 minutes, 20 min to Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, 28 min to Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame). You may need to buy the tickets at the airport, before taking the bus: the bus only sells SMS tickets which can only be bought with a French mobile phone number, at the RER station you'll be able to buy \u20ac4.35 tickets to Paris. Navigo, Mobilis, Ticket jeunes, Paris Visite are accepted as long as they cover at least zones 1\u20134.\n\n\nBy tram to Paris\nTramway line T7 has a station under the terminal 4, and goes to Villejuif-Louis Aragon on metro line 7 (between 05:30 (06:30 on Sunday) and 00:30, every 6 to 15 minutes, the trip takes about 30 min to the metro, then another 20 minutes to Chatelet in the center of Paris). You can buy a \u20ac1.90 \"ticket t+\" on the machines at the tram station, that you'll need to validate once you get in the tram. You can not buy your ticket on board. You will need another ticket t+ for the metro. Navigo, Mobilis, Ticket jeunes, Paris Visite are accepted as long as they cover at least zones 1\u20134. The airport station is not the last one on the line and you want to get on the tram that is on the track closest to the exit from the airport and heading away from the tunnel to the left of the platform.\n\n\nBy bus to Paris\nThe Orlybus service (every 10-15 min, between 06:00 and 00:30, \u20ac8) connects terminal 4 to Denfert-Rochereau in Paris (RER B, metro 4 and 6), but it's subject to traffic jams and rush hour, so it averages 30 min but can last much longer if the traffic is bad (usually in late afternoon Monday-Friday and Sunday). Mobilis and Ticket jeune tickets are not accepted on this line, but Paris Visite zone 1-5 is accepted. If you buy a single ticket, you will need to buy another ticket in Paris to transfer with the bus, metro or RER.\nIf you're looking for cheap alternatives, you have two options:\n\nMonday-Friday, from 06:00 to 20:00: take tram T7 from terminal 4 to Porte de Rungis (15 minutes), then bus 216 (it's a circle line, so you cannot take it in the wrong direction, you will reach Denfert-Rochereau after 30 minutes). You'll just need a ticket t+ (\u20ac1.90) that you will validate on both the tram and the bus. You can transfer to other bus or trams in Paris, but will need another ticket to transfer to metro or RER.\nEvery day, between 06:00 and 00:20: take bus 183 to Robert Peary, then tram T9 to Porte de Choisy. You'll just need a ticket t+ (\u20ac1.90 if bought on a machine at the airport), but the trip takes about 1 hour.\n\n\nBy train from Paris\nThe fastest option, but also the most expensive, is taking the RER B from Paris to Antony (look for trains terminating at either St R\u00e9my l\u00e8s Chevreuse, Orsay-Ville or Massy-Palaiseau, the journey from Denfert-Rocherau to Antony takes about 15 minutes, from Chatelet les Halles about 23 minutes), and from there take the Orlyval to either terminal 1 or 4 (runs from 05:40 to 23:00, a 8 minutes trip). Orlyval itself costs \u20ac9.30, and a ticket from Orly airport all the way to Paris costs \u20ac12.05 (this ticket allows you to transfer to other RER or metro lines once in Paris). Navigo, Mobilis, or Ticket jeunes, are not accepted on Orlyval (they are although accepted on RER B, as long as they cover at least zones 1-3). Paris Visite is valid on Orlyval.\nAnother option is to take the RER C from Paris to Pont de Rungis-A\u00e9roport d'Orly (look for trains terminating at Pont de Rungis, called ROMI, or Massy Palaiseau, called MONA. Do not get off at Orly Ville station, just before Pont de Rungis) (20 min from Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand to Pont de Rungis, 28 min from Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame), and from there bus 183 to terminal 4 (between 04:45 and 1:10, every 15 minutes, it takes about 10 min). The trip from Paris costs \u20ac4.45 + \u20ac1.90 for the bus (you cannot buy your ticket on board of the bus, but you can buy it at Pont de Rungis station), and allows to transfer to other RER or metro lines in Paris. Navigo, Mobilis, Ticket jeunes, Paris Visite are accepted as long as they cover at least zones 1\u20134.\n\n\nBy tram from Paris\nTake metro line 7 to Villejuif-Louis Aragon (first metro passes at Chatelet at 05:51, the trip from Chatelet takes about 20 minutes, in the center of Paris), and from there tramway line T7 to terminal 4 (the last tram leaves at 00:30, the trip takes about 30 min). You can buy a \u20ac1.90 \"ticket t+\" on the machines at the tram station, that you'll need to validate once you get in the tram. You can not buy your ticket on board, or use the ticket you used for the metro. Navigo, Mobilis, Ticket jeunes, Paris Visite are accepted as long as they cover at least zones 1\u20134.\n\n\nBy bus from Paris\nThe Orlybus service (between 05:35 and 00:00, every 10-15 minutes, \u20ac8) connects Denfert-Rochereau in Paris (RER B, metro 4 and 6) to terminals 1-2-3 and 4, but it's subject to traffic jams and rush hour, so it averages 30 min but can lasts much longer if the traffic is bad (usually in late afternoon Monday-Friday and Sunday). Mobilis and Ticket jeune tickets are not accepted on this line, but Paris Visite zone 1-5 is accepted.\nIf you're looking for cheap alternatives, you have two options:\n\nMonday-Friday, from 06:00 to 20:00: take bus 216 from Denfert-Rochereau or Stade Charl\u00e9ty (tram T3a) to Saarinen (15 min), then take tram T7 heading to Porte de l'Essonne to Orly Airport (terminal 4) (15 min), You'll just need a ticket t+ (\u20ac1.90) that you will validate on both the bus and the tram. You can transfer to other bus or trams in Paris, but will need another ticket if you transfer from the metro or RER.\nEvery day, between 06:00 and 00:20: take tram T9 from Porte de Choisy to Four - Peary, then bus 183 to A\u00e9roport d'Orly. You'll just need a ticket t+ (\u20ac1.90 if bought on a machine in the tram station), but the trip takes 1 hour.\n\n\nAt night\nNoctilien buses serve Orly airport roughly every hour between 01:00 and 05:00:\n\nLine  N131 serves Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Quai de la Gare, Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Orly 1-2-3, and Orly 4\nLine  N144 serves Gare de l'Est, Chatelet, Bastille, Gare de Lyon, Place d'Italie, and Orly 4\nYou will need either 2 t+ tickets (\u20ac4 if bought on board, \u20ac3.80 if bought at a machine), or a Navigo, Mobilis, Ticket jeune, or Paris Visite, covering at least zones 1\u20134.\n\n\nGet around\nOrlyval light-rail shuttle is free to use between terminals 1 and 4, taking only 1 minute. It runs every day from 06:00 to 23:00, every 5 minutes during peak hours, every 7\u00bd minutes off-peak.\nA free shuttle bus links terminals 1-2-3 and 4, with intermediate stops at the P6 car park / Ibis hotel / police station, the P4 car park, the P7 car park, and the P5 car park. It runs every 9 to 19 minutes, every day from 03:30 (04:30 between November and March) to 00:30.\n\n\nWait\n\n\nEat and drink\nFood and beverage is available throughout each terminal. Hours of operation vary, however, aside from the very early morning and late evening there will be options before and after security.
