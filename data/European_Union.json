  "extract": "The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 27 member states in Europe. Additional countries participate in specific areas, such as immigration controls and currency.\nTravel between member states is generally much easier than crossing other international borders, both for residents and for people from outside the union.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nThe European Union was in part motivated by the catastrophe of World War II, with the idea that European integration would prevent such a disastrous war from happening again. The idea was first proposed by the French foreign minister Robert Schuman in a speech in 1950. Schuman was from Alsace \u2013 a region at the heart of three violent changes of hand between Germany and France between 1870 and 1944. The speech resulted in the first agreements in 1951: the European Coal and Steel Community, which formed the basis for the European Union. Another important milestone was the Treaty of Rome which came into force on 1 January 1958, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) which evolved into today's European Union.\nWhile the attempt to create a \"European Army\" failed in the 1950s due to the instability of the Fourth French Republic which was preoccupied with Indochina and Algeria at the time, the six founding members (Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux countries) pressed on with deeper integration and the reduction of barriers to trade and free movement. While the United Kingdom at first saw itself as a benevolent spectator more focused on its special relationship with the U.S. and with its empire and Commonwealth, by the 1960s the French veto was the only thing keeping them from joining. The UK joined the EEC in 1973 together with Ireland and Denmark. During the 1970s military dictatorships fell in Greece, Spain and Portugal, and democracy was reinstated. A few years later, these countries joined the EEC.\nThe EFTA (European Free Trade Area) was set up as an alternative of sorts to the EEC/EU, with EFTA members mostly participating in the trade aspects of the EU but foregoing other forms of deeper integration. Most former EFTA countries have now joined the EU. The EEA (European Economic Area), covering more areas of coordination, has now mostly taken the role of EFTA. Switzerland was part of both but has now replaced EEA membership with more or less equivalent bilateral agreements.\nThe mid-1980s to the mid-1990s were important years in the history of the EU, with the Single European Act (establishing a single market), the Schengen Agreement (establishing free movement), and the Maastricht Treaty (establishing the single currency and cooperation in several areas from agricultural policies to peacekeeping) being signed and coming into force. From that point on, the union became known as the EC (European Community) and eventually as the EU. Also during this time the Iron Curtain fell and Germany was reunited, which marked the beginning of the eastwards expansion of the union. The former EFTA members Austria, Finland and Sweden joined in 1995 (the Norwegians voted against membership), and the number of members almost doubled in the first decade of the 21st century, when a large number of the former Eastern Bloc countries joined.\nThe European Union has been active in brokering peace both at home (e.g. Northern Ireland) and abroad with mixed results. Successes include the relatively peaceful resolution after the Balkan and Kosovo wars, which resulted in two former Yugoslav Republics (Croatia and Slovenia) becoming EU members. \nEU institutions have long been criticised for a perceived lack of democracy. Although democracy is a key European ideal, many think that the bureaucracy and the long chain between institutions and voters make the EU significantly less democratic than its member states. That the union was built around economics still shows: social and environmental issues (among others) are often handled as an afterthought. One answer to this criticism is that the European Parliament has been directly elected every five years since 1979, and has increased its power in the last decades. However, it still lacks some of the powers other parliaments have or has to share them with other bodies. Transparency has become much better, though still a problem. There is also an ongoing argument about how to bring the EU \"closer\" to its citizens. This has resulted in the EU being a highly-visible sponsor for many minor projects, including projects that traditionally were adequately handled locally at least in some countries. This sponsorship has been important in cases where the area has been neglected at the national level, and local resources have been scarce.\nThe European Union experienced its first member departure on January 31, 2020, as the United Kingdom voted in a referendum in 2016 to withdraw from the union, in a process known as Brexit. Although the country had always been known for a high degree of euro-scepticism, the vote was driven by internal government party politics with no actual popular demand for the referendum. Nevertheless, a hard campaign was fought yielding a surprising narrow victory (only about 4% gap) for \"leave\". There have been similar calls for leaving from growing Eurosceptic parties in France, the Netherlands and Germany and other EU countries, although none are gaining enough traction to push for more referendums, as of Feb 2024. Practical information about post-Brexit travel between the UK and the EU is provided by the UK government.\n\n\nEuropean institutions and organisation\nThere are at least four EU related groups of countries in Europe relevant to the traveller. They overlap but are not identical:\n\nThe European Union (EU), a partial political and customs union.\nThe European Economic Area (EEA), where most of the EU legislation applies, including the freedom of movement, which allows citizens visa free travel and right to stay for work or study. EEA comprises the EU (although EEA membership is separate) plus EFTA members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Switzerland is member of EFTA, used to be a member of the EEA, and has (more or less) equivalent bilateral agreements.\nThe Eurozone comprises countries using and controlling the common currency, the euro (\u20ac), all of which are EU members. The euro is also the currency of Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican City and Andorra by agreement with the European Union. Kosovo and Montenegro also use the currency, though they are not part of the Eurozone and there is no agreement with the EU. Eventual adoption of the euro is a requirement for new members, however some existing EU countries neither use nor plan to introduce the euro.\nThe Schengen Area comprises countries using common visas and immigration controls. While primarily composed of EU member states, the Schengen area also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Some EU members, such as the Republic of Ireland, are not part of the Schengen agreement. Some small states in Europe \u2014 Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican City \u2014 that in practice are inaccessible other than through the Schengen area are de facto part of the area given that there are no border controls. On the other hand, travel to and from Andorra is controlled, though it can be legally visited on a Schengen visa.\nThe Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) includes the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City. Transfers denominated in euros can be done with the same rules as with domestic systems. If you have a euro-denominated account, you can pay with chipped debit and credit cards (Mastercard or Visa) issued anywhere in the SEPA. A limitation is that not all countries in the SEPA have adopted the euro, so you may still have to exchange from the euro to the national currency.\nIn addition to these there are European institutions independent of the EU. One such is the Council of Europe (CoE), an international organisation aiming to uphold human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe, and to promote European culture. All EU members are also members of the CoE, and the EU has adopted the council's flag and anthem. Another is the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, created during the cold war to further understanding between governments across the Iron Curtain. It is still an important institution for the furthering of peace.\n\n1 Winter time. In summer (last Sunday in March to Saturday before last Sunday in October): WET \u2192 WEST (UTC+0 \u2192 +1), CET \u2192 CEST (+1 \u2192 +2), EET \u2192 EEST (+2 \u2192 +3). Summer time may be abolished, probably with related changes in timezones.\n2 Air and sea borders only.\nThe United Kingdom left the EU on the 31st January 2020, and the transition period ended on 1st January 2021.\nThere are also territories around the world outside of continental Europe that belong to the European Union owing to the sovereignty of an EU member and subsequent agreement:\n\nTerritories outside of continental Europe and not included in the list above are not considered part of the European Union, even if they belong to EU countries. Moreover, the French territories listed above are not part of the Schengen Area, so Schengen visas are not valid for visiting them. Territories such as New Caledonia (France) and Greenland (Denmark) have separate entry and travel requirements. However, even in territories that aren't part of the European Union, certain EU regulations relevant to travel may apply. On the other hand, even in certain places that are part of the EU certain exceptions to EU or national laws relevant to travel apply.\n\n\nGet in\n\nSee also: Travelling around the Schengen Area\nThe EU does not have an all-encompassing immigration policy, and therefore immigration controls are in principle specific to each country. However, most of its members have adopted the Schengen Agreement, which makes travel very easy between these. Four non-EU countries (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland) also belong to the Schengen area, while three European micro-states \u2013 Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City \u2013 do not have any immigration controls with the Schengen countries. Andorra can only be accessed from the Schengen Area, and can be legally visited on a Schengen visa.\nThere is an earlier, related but separate, concept of free movement inside the EU, which gives EU/EEA/Swiss nationals the right of abode and full employment rights in each other's countries regardless of Schengen.\nThere are usually no border controls between countries that have signed the Schengen Agreement. Members of Schengen are still permitted to introduce border checks temporarily for security reasons, such as in connection with major events (and since 2015: crises), and there may be random checks of travel documents, not only at the border. A tourist visa granted for any Schengen Agreement signatory country is valid in all other countries that signed the treaty. However, people who need a visa should get a visa from their \"primary destination\" country.\nTravel between a Schengen Agreement country and any non-Schengen country will mostly result in normal border checks. Ireland and the United Kingdom operate a \"Common Travel Area\" policy which is outside the Schengen agreement and as such, both countries require passport controls of travellers arriving from other EU countries, while Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus have not adopted Schengen yet, despite joining the EU.\nRussian citizens and residents, and perhaps Belarusian ones, have a problem coming from their homeland because of the war on Ukraine. The Baltic countries, Poland and Finland deny entry to most Russian tourists at their respective land borders. There are also no flights between Russia or Belarus and the EU. Flights via a third country may be the most convenient means of entry. Getting a visa has become more difficult, especially to the above-mentioned five countries, and they are also retracting long-time multi-entry visas. There are negotiations on introducing a more uniform policy. Russian passports issued in or to residents of disputed territories may be rejected.\n\n\nEEA citizens\nSee also Work below\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland (i.e. EU and EFTA as of 2024; new members may not yet be in the EEA) face no restrictions on travelling anywhere in the EEA and Switzerland (however, some territories of EEA countries are outside the EEA), other than having a valid passport or ID card, except in some cases for serious criminal convictions. They should use the immigration queue often signed \"EEA\". There are some restrictions on stays longer than three months.\nCitizens also have the right to travel freely together with their spouse and some other close family regardless of their citizenship. Such third-party nationals need to carry their passports and accepted evidence on the relationship, and may need to get a visa (granted with an accelerated procedure). The EU rules do not apply in the country of the citizen, where national rules apply instead.\nCitizens do not need visas to study or work in other EU countries (except possible restrictions on working for nationals of new EU members), but moving to another EU country for an extended time (more than three, six or twelve months) can cause a change of residency and mean you lose social welfare and healthcare benefits in your former country. Such longer stays may also require some specific status, such as employed, student or pensioner with own funds. Many countries require registration of new long-term residents, and a change of driving licence after one year.\nSee the EU info for the specifics. Slightly different rules apply for Ireland (with Schengen opt-out) and Switzerland (which is not an EU/EFTA member). Note also special territories, such as the Faroe Islands.\nIn the Nordic countries, including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which are not part of the EEA, similar freedom of movement and right to work and stay, and some other rights, apply to Nordic citizens independently of the EU, EEA and Schengen, with no time limits or other requirements.\n\n\nBy yacht\nFor entering by yacht, the distinction between EU and non-EU vessels is important. For the former, you need documentation on ownership and payment of tax (VAT). For the latter, you need to \"temporarily import\" the vessel, though usually without paperwork; if you stay too long or cannot prove date of entry, you may need to pay any duty and tax associated with permanent importation, and you may have to provide some security for the case of overstaying. The period is independent of the Schengen 90/180 days. Residents of the EU cannot \"temporarily import\" a non-EU vessel.\nFor the Schengen Area, getting passports stamped is not necessarily easy at all ports of entry, which means that sufficient other documentation needs to be secured, especially if some of the crew is going to leave on their own. Greece and Italy require a transit log, recording port visits in those countries and anybody leaving or joining the crew. In Greece, overnight visits to the shore need to be told to immigration. Also when leaving the Schengen Area for a third country, you need to take care of the proper formalities.\nRequirements on skipper qualification varies between countries, with the ICC, the Yachtmaster Offshore certificate and similar common certificates probably recognised. Also a radio operator's certificate is needed. For canals and rivers beyond the first lock there are additional requirements.\n\n\nCustoms\n\n\nAnimals\n\nFree movement inside the EU does not always apply to your pets. Relevant national rules should be consulted before travel.\nEU citizens can travel within the EU with their cat, dog or ferret provided they have a European pet passport with required treatments documented. The most important compulsory treatments are those against rabies, and against the tapeworm Echinococcus in at least Ireland, Malta and Finland.\n\n\nAlcohol and tobacco from outside of the EU\nYou're legally allowed tax-free import from outside the EU of 1 litre of spirits (above 22% alcohol) or 2 litres of alcohol (e.g. sparkling wine below 22% alcohol) and 4 litres of non-sparkling wine and 16 litres of beer. If you're younger than 17, it is half these amounts or nothing at all. Amounts exceeding this must be reported at customs for paying (quite heavy) duties and taxes.\nAmounts of tobacco allowed depend on your country of arrival.\nAge restrictions on handling tobacco and alcohol vary by country.\n\n\nFood and plants\nMeat and milk products, fresh berries, fruits and vegetables, seeds, cuttings, cut flowers, potted plants and the like may not be brought from outside the EU \u2013 they need a certificate, impractical for non-commercial import. A few tropical fruits are exempted, but e.g. apples and oranges are not allowed; eat them before customs. There are also some exceptions for baby food and foodstuff needed for medical reasons. Check if relevant.\nThere are less severe restrictions for import from some countries, such as Norway, Switzerland and San Marino.\n\n\nMedicines\nYou can usually bring your own medicines, but look out for medicines locally classified as narcotics and medicine-like products not regarded as medicines. You usually need to bring the medicines in their original packaging and have the prescription. If the prescription isn't in an EU language, you may want to carry also a translation.\n\n\nMoving between countries inside the EU\nThere are no restrictions on moving goods between EU states. For certain types of goods, such as alcohol and tobacco, taxes of the country you are entering may have to be paid, unless the goods are for \"personal use\" (including as gifts and the like, with quite strict criteria). Claiming personal use is not enough; if the authorities suspect the goods are for resale and you cannot convince them, you are in trouble. At a minimum they will ask you to pay the appropriate duty or face confiscation of the goods.\nFor antiques and some other cultural products there may be additional restrictions.\nFor medicines, check their status for all countries you are going to travel through. If you get medication while in the EU or the Schengen, tell your doctor about your travel plans, to get an international prescription.\nProducts that may spread animal diseases should generally not be brought across borders.\nSome areas within the EU, such as \u00c5land, are not part of the customs union (actually: the VAT union). Products need to be imported across those borders, which may affect what you can carry without paying duties.\n\n\nLong stay with vehicles\nIf you plan on coming by car or yacht and staying for an extended period, check the rules not to have to register it locally \u2013 or how to register it without too many bad surprises. Generally the vehicle has to leave the EU within 18 months (get and keep papers proving entry date). Lending such a vehicle to an EU resident or to a non-relative is usually not allowed. Moving vehicles between EU countries is not free either: stays longer than 6 months (depending on local law) can be considered permanent, which means that the vehicle has to be registered locally and substantial taxes have to be paid. For yachts, you can prolong the 18 months by having it wharfed off season according to specific bureaucracy.\n\n\nCurrency\nWhen travelling between EU countries with \u20ac10,000 or more in physical assets (euros, other currencies, precious metal etc.), you should check with authorities in each country whether special measures are needed. Maintaining your cash in an EU bank account effectively frees you from any such controls, since the free movement of capital is maintained across the EU. In EU countries not using the euro, you can still have your account in that currency, avoiding some international transaction fees.\nYou must declare at customs when leaving the EU with \u20ac10,000 or more in euros or the equivalent in other currencies.\n\n\nGet around\nAlthough the European Union is moving towards standardisation of travel, national laws do still vary and it is important to refer to the article for each country for planning your trip. Similarly, while open access and harmonisation of railway legislation are intended to lead to an integrated railway market for all of Europe, national railways still dominate their countries and overlap tends to be limited.\n\n\nBy car\nSee also: Driving in Europe\n\nWith the exceptions of Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta, which drive on the left, the EU drives on the right. There are no restrictions on cars being driven to a country that drives on the other side. Extra care must be taken however; simple modifications to mirrors and headlights make driving somewhat easier.\nAll cars with the standard EU license plate may be driven without additional requirements in another EU country. Cars with other types of license plates must have an oval decal affixed to the car with the international licence plate country code.\n\n\nDriving licence\n\nEU drivers are issued with a standard European Union driving licence. If you hold an EU driving licence then it may be used for driving throughout the EU. One important caveat is that age restrictions are not uniform across the EU, and your licence is not valid in any EU country unless you also meet the minimum age requirement. Old driving licences may be a hassle, get one of the standardised type if possible.\nIf you hold a non-EU driving licence, then check with each country in order to determine whether it is valid.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in Europe\nBorder controls on international trains are usually done on the moving train and usually via spot checks. No international train stops at the border for significant amounts of time. Tickets can usually be bought from both national railways involved unless it is a \"private\" operator like Thalys. Prices may differ depending on the country where you buy the tickets. When you buy online, prices may vary depending on the website you use and sometimes even depending on the language version of the website. The EU also pushes for more and better high speed rail connections across borders, designating prioritised corridors and spending EU resources as well as encouraging member states to spend their own or local funds on rail projects. The corridors are summarized under the heading TEN-T (Trans European Network for Transportation).\n\n\nCustomer protection for travel issues\nThe EU continues to create a common framework for travel between all the member states as well as across EU's external borders. This may assist you with issues you may face when travelling; see Cope below.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nThe euro\n\nThe euro (\u20ac; EUR) is the common currency of 20 of the 27 countries that are members of the European Union. These are commonly called the Eurozone. The other 8 countries of the EU retain their national currencies.\nOne euro equals 100 cents, sometimes referred to as \"eurocents\" especially when there is need to distinguish them from other currencies divided into cents.\nWhen an EU country decides to adopt the euro, there is a transition period during which the local currency being phased out and euros are both legal tender. Be aware when this period ends, so as not to be left with the phased-out currency when it is no longer possible to use it for payment. The period may be as short as two weeks. If you end up with any of the obsolete currencies, you may be able to change it in a bank, but don't count on it.\nEven in EU countries that have not adopted the euro, it is usually the easiest foreign currency to exchange and is accepted in some places at the discretion of the business, but the exchange rate is unlikely to be favourable. For details, see the destination articles.\n\nEuro banknotes are the same in all countries, except for small identifying national features, such as the first letter in the serial number and a printing code. Coins, on the other hand, will be identical on the reverse (value) side across countries, while the obverse is country-specific. Although the coins thus look different, they can be used in any country within the Eurozone, for example a \u20ac1 coin with a Greek symbol can be used freely in Spain. There are also commemorative coins, with the obverse looking different than on other coins from the same country, also legal tender everywhere.\n\nNormal coins: All eurozone countries have coins issued with a distinctive national design on the obverse, and a standard common design on the reverse. The coins can be used in any Eurozone country, regardless of the design used (e.g. a one-euro coin from Finland can be used in Portugal).\nCommemorative two euro coins: The obverse differs from normal two euro coins, but they are used like the normal coins (although more likely to end up among collectors). Each country may produce a certain amount of them as part of their normal coin production and sometimes \"Europe-wide\" two euro coins are produced to commemorate special events (e.g. the anniversary of important treaties).\nOther commemorative coins: Commemorative coins of other amounts (e.g. \u20ac10 or more) have entirely special designs and often contain non-negligible amounts of gold, silver or platinum. While they are legal tender at face value, merchants may not accept them. As their material and collector values are usually much higher than their face value, they will hardly be found in circulation.\nLow-value coins (one and two cents) are being phased out to varying degrees in several countries. For example, in the Netherlands all cash payments are rounded to the nearest 5 cents and shops may refuse 1 and 2 cents as long as it is being indicated on for example a sticker at the window or till. In Finland payments in cash will likewise be rounded, but you can use the small coins for paying the rounded prices. In other countries, e.g. in Germany, those coins are treated as any other money and prices are not rounded.\n\n\nValue added tax\nAll purchases made within the European Union are subject to value added tax (VAT), included in the advertised prices.\nNon-residents can claim the VAT back for goods they are taking back to their home country, under certain circumstances. In many countries, the purchases must be above a minimum value at a single merchant. Therefore, you may benefit from making several purchases in one transaction, instead of visiting multiple stores. Not all merchants participate in the refund program, so check before finalizing the purchase. Present your passport at the register, and the seller will complete the necessary paperwork. Keep these documents, as you will need to present them to customs before leaving the EU. Paying with a non-EU credit card will make this easier.\nEU regulations around VAT and duty do not apply to certain places inside the EU including the Canary Islands and the \u00c5land islands\n\n\nDebit cards\nMost EU countries use debit cards as the primary method of payment.  However, some merchants in some countries only accept local-only debit card (i.e. those without a Visa or MasterCard logo).\nIf you have a euro currency debit card then you will not pay any additional charges from your bank when using the card in another EU country to:\n\nWithdraw cash from an ATM (although cash machine operators may charge their own fees)\nPay for goods or services\nMany large banks outside of the EU offer Traveler Cards in the euro currency that have the same benefits. Other debit and credit cards will also work but their use can be subject to fees.\nEuropean EC, Maestro, and V-Pay debit cards are being eliminated and replaced with debit cards of Visa Debit and Debit Mastercard.\n\n\nTransferring money within the EU\nThere are nominally no restrictions in transferring funds between banks in different EU member states (although capital controls were imposed on Greece and Cyprus in the 2010s). Within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) transfers in euro are considered domestic and no additional charges can be applied in the normal case. This also applies to euro funds transferred to EU countries not belonging to the Eurozone (i.e. a transfer of \u20ac1,000 from Germany to Sweden will still be treated as a domestic transfer, even though the euro is not Sweden's currency).\nFor travellers this means that you can easily pay for goods and services throughout the Eurozone provided that you have a euro currency bank account anywhere in the EU.\nSee the article on Money for more information on the topic.\n\n\nVisit\n\nThe EU isn't a travel destination in itself, although being regarded as an important project it does open many of its institutions in order to help people learn about it and its objectives. These are generally spread across the whole EU, although key institutions are to be found in a small area in Northern Europe in the cities of Brussels, Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt.\nThe public transport between all the institutions below is excellent, and you can visit them all with a combination of train and tram. The memorials may be more remote, but can still be accessed by regular buses.\n\n1 Parlamentarium, Willy Brandt building, Rue Wiertz / Wiertzstraat 60, B-1047, Brussels, Belgium.

(updated Jun 2017)\n\n\nWork\nAn EEA or Swiss citizen can generally apply for jobs in any of these countries under the same conditions as a local citizen, as can Nordic citizens in Nordic countries (for them including the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which are not part of the EEA). Work permits are not required, but certificates required for some types of work are not always recognised. Citizens of new EU countries may face restrictions during a transitional period (of 2, 5 or 7 years).\nAndorra, Monaco and San Marino have freedom of movement arrangements with the neighbouring countries for their citizens, but this privilege does not extend to the rest of the EU/EEA. \nWorking permits for non-EEA/Swiss citizens are country-specific and often hard to get.\nIn some countries, some visa-exempt visitors may work during their visa-free stay. In some countries, students (visa-free or with student visa) may work part-time.\nAccessing social security benefits may depend on the length of time that you have worked in that country. EEA/Swiss citizens usually get the local social security \u2013 and lose the domestic \u2013 at the moment they start working, but there are exceptions.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\n\nHealth coverage for EU residents\nAll EU countries operate public healthcare services that provide medical treatment for free or low cost to all residents. Non-EU residents can also use these systems, although they may have to pay a fee.\nTravellers who live outside the EU and hold citizenship of an EU country may find that it is not possible to access the public health service in the same way as residents.\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss residents can obtain a European Health Insurance Card that gives access to public medical care on the same terms as for local residents in any other of the countries. This includes necessary treatment of chronic conditions, but not advanced medical treatment. The specific rules and practices vary quite a lot from country to country, but generally you will get cheap or free medical care. Not all doctors and hospitals operate within the reimbursement system, so check beforehand.\nIt is important to carry your Health Insurance Card at all times, since it will simplify greatly getting access to medical treatment abroad in any EU country. You still have the same rights to treatment without it, however you may be asked to pay all costs upfront, and then go through a complex process of reimbursement when you return home.\nThere are some restrictions:\n\nThe Health Insurance Card cannot be used in Denmark by holders who are not citizens of an EU country (residency is not sufficient).\nCroatian citizens cannot use the Health Insurance Card in Switzerland\nThe Health Insurance Card does not cover rescue and repatriation services\nHealth Insurance Card does not cover private healthcare or planned treatment in another EU country\n\n\nHealth coverage for non-EU residents\nAll EU countries have public health services that are available for everyone to use. Non-EU residents may be charged for using these services, and the cost will vary between countries where the health service was used. Being an EU citizen who is resident outside the EU may mean that you fall into this category.\nEmergency services are generally available to everyone without having to pay upfront. Nevertheless, private travel insurance should be considered, and may be mandatory, for travel to the EU.\n\n\nMedical prescriptions\nAnyone visiting a doctor in the EU can request a cross-border prescription. This means that the prescription is valid and will be honoured in any other EU country.\nPharmacies may refuse to supply you with medicine without this prescription.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nAir passenger rights\n\nYou are covered by the same set of passenger rights when flying:\n\nwithin the EU on any airline\ndeparting the EU on any airline\narriving into the EU on an EU airline\nThese rights include:\n\nTicket price: Your nationality and the location of purchase must not affect the price\nOnline booking: All websites are legally obliged to clearly display all costs before booking, including  taxes, airport charges, surcharges and other fees\nFinancial compensation: You will be compensated a set amount when a flight is cancelled, delayed more than three hours (at arrival) or you are denied boarding.\nWithin the EU: \u20ac250 for 1,500 km or less, \u20ac400 for over 1,500 km\nBetween an EU and a non-EU airport: \u20ac250 for 1,500 km or less, \u20ac400 for 1,500-3,500 km, \u20ac600 for over 3,500 km\nTravellers by air can submit an  air passenger rights EU complaint form on return if they wish to apply for a refund or compensation.\n\n\nRail passenger rights\nYou are covered by the same set of passenger rights when travelling by rail between any two EU countries. These rules do not apply when travelling by rail inside an EU country, or travelling to or from a non-EU country, however some railways have adopted similar rules for domestic travel and in some countries of the EU they are national law.\nIf before your journey you are told that you will experience at least a one-hour delay, then you are entitled to:\n\nCancel your journey with an immediate refund\nAccommodation (if an overnight delay is expected)\nMeals and refreshments\nRefund if you continue your journey:\n25% of the fare, if delayed between 1 and 2 hours\n50% of the fare, if delayed more than 2 hours late.\nCompensation for lost or damaged registered luggage:\nUp to \u20ac1,300 per piece of luggage, if value can be proven\n\u20ac300 per piece of luggage, if value can not be proven\nWhile it is possible to get a reimbursement for some of the above after you already paid them out of your pocket, it is easier to directly contact the company while still on the train. The easiest way to do this is to talk to conductors or other staff  on the train when a delay is probable or when you are likely to miss your connection. They will usually give you forms for your refund and give you contact details for meals or hotels as most major railways have contracts with certain hotels in major cities to be able to hand out vouchers for stranded passengers.\n\n\nBus passenger rights\nYou are covered by the same set of passenger rights when travelling by bus between any two EU countries for a distance greater than 250 km. These rules do not apply when travelling by bus inside an EU country, or travelling to or from a non-EU country.\nIf you experience a two-hour delay in your journey, then you are entitled to either:\n\nCancel your journey with a refund as well as be provided with a free journey back to your initial departure point\nRequest alternative travel arrangements to your destination\nAdditionally you may be entitled to:\n\nRefreshments\nAccommodation overnight to a maximum \u20ac80 if required (except when delay is caused by severe weather)\n\n\nShip passenger rights\nYou are covered by the same set of passenger rights when travelling by ship from or to the EU. These rights generally do not extend to freight ships or small vessels (less than 13 passenger capacity).\n\nCancel your journey with a refund as well as be provided with a free journey back to your initial departure point\nRequest alternative travel arrangements to your destination\nIf you experience a delay arriving at your destination for more than 1 hour and it is not caused by bad weather, then you may be entitled to compensation worth between 25% and 50% of your paid ticket price.\n\n\nConsular assistance\nSee also: Diplomatic missions\nAlthough the EU runs its own diplomatic missions, known as delegations, these are exclusively dedicated to government-to-government relations and do not provide consular services. Consular services are provided by the missions of individual EU countries. However, citizens of EU member states have the right to seek consular assistance from the missions of any EU member state when in a country where their country lacks representation.\n\n\nStay safe\nDialling \u260f 112 from any phone will connect you to all emergency services, with English-speaking staff available, wherever you are in the EU. In some countries your call will be forwarded to a more specific number depending on the emergency, in others all or most emergencies are centrally handled. There is always English-speaking staff available on 112. Calling with a SIM-less phone works in some countries, in some the answering is delayed or requires you to type an additional \"5\".\n\n\nConnect\nSee also: Mobile phones#Europe\n\n\nBy phone\nIf your mobile phone operator is based in the European Union (or Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway), then the default is for roaming to be no more expensive than domestic use. Dubbed \"roam like at home\", this means that you can buy a SIM in any EU/EEA country and use it across the region more or less as if you never left that country, for the same price. This covers most calls and text messages as well as data. You should get the level of service promised in your plan, to the extent it is available in the local networks.\nThere are some limitations. The regulations on roaming are primarily intended to ease the life of EU residents who roam with their domestic SIM. In some countries operators require you to prove a tie to the country to get a roam-like-at-home plan. Operators are allowed to place limits to discourage buying a plan that will mostly be used for roaming. Above these limits, you may be charged \u20ac1\u20132/GB even if your plan covers \"unlimited\" use. Also, cost of free, extra charge and similar special numbers may differ from that with a domestic SIM. You should be informed about limits and charges in your contract, by an SMS when crossing borders and on a dedicated web page.\nSome plans do not include roaming at all. While the regulations apply to default plans that offer roaming, operators are allowed to offer plans that aren't covered. Some plans include countries outside the EU, such as the UK, on the same terms. Non-European territories of EU countries are covered only by some plans, often by operators in the relevant mother country.\nWhile any EU countries' mainland territory in Europe is covered, this does not include non-terrestrial networks, such as service via satellite onboard ships. Close to the outer borders, your phone may choose a network from outside EU/EEA. Where connecting to a network that isn't covered is likely, be sure to choose the network manually.\nIf you exceed the limits on roaming use, the per unit Eurotariff surcharges below apply. You should be informed by SMS when you reach 80% of your quota, and if you are to reach \u20ac100 in any one billing month.\nSee this EU FAQ for more information on exceptions and restrictions to the roaming policy.\nThe Eurotariff dictates the maximum surcharge for roaming and the maximum cost with it included, when your plan and network is covered. VAT is not included in the table:\n\nIf you use a provider from outside EU/EEA, the roaming surcharges are not covered by these regulations. This includes the UK, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man.\n\n\nBy post\nEach EU country runs its own postal service; stamps from one EU country are not valid in another. Even some autonomous regions, such as \u00c5land, have their own postal services with stamps of their own.\n\n\nInternet censorship\nDue to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, all Russian government-affiliated news sites, including RT and Sputnik News, have been blocked in the European Union. This includes their content on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, which is not allowed to be viewed within the European Union.",
