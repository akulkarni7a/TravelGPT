  "extract": "Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur (PACA) is the most popular holiday region in the south of France. It covers a large area from the Mediterranean Sea in the south up to the French Alps in the north and extends west to east along the coast from the river Rh\u00f4ne all the way to the Italian border. Its identity as a geographical region being a legacy of the Roman Empire, the Provence includes the French Riviera and is famous for its sunny weather, colourful countryside, long-standing traditions and local language (Proven\u00e7al). The region's favourable climate makes the variety of available local produce second to none. Flowers, fruits and vegetables all grow in abundance, the sea's fish and shellfish stocks are rich and all this without forgetting those two most Proven\u00e7al of industries: wine-making and perfumery.\nPerhaps best known for the many fashionable resorts along the C\u00f4te d'Azur, the Provence's other main attractions include the Old Port of Marseille, the ancient cities of Aix-en-Provence and Avignon, as well as a plethora of sun-baked villages and mountaintop towns. So why not follow in the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh and see for yourself why Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur is such a special and inspirational destination?\n\n\nDepartments\n\n\nCities\n1 Marseille \u2014 the second largest city in France has around one million inhabitants and a major port\n2 Aix-en-Provence \u2014 the city of water and art, Paul C\u00e9zanne's hometown and a source of inspiration for many of his landscapes\n3 Arles \u2014 an inspiration for Vincent van Gogh, as well as the site of numerous Roman remains\n4 Avignon \u2014 known for its Palace of the Popes, where several popes and antipopes lived between the 14th and 15th centuries, and for its folk song-spawning bridge.\n5 Cannes \u2014 a glamorous and expensive seaside town that hosts the annual Film Festival\n6 Monaco \u2014 a wealthy city-state on the Mediterranean Sea with entertainment for those with money to burn\n7 Nice \u2014 a major beach resort along the French Riviera with its famous Victorian waterfront, the Promenade des Anglais\n8 Toulon \u2014 this medium-sized naval city has an old town and links to Operation Dragoon, aka the Mediterranean D-Day\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Camargue \u2014 one of Europe's largest river deltas and wetlands, a great place to spot flamingos and French cowboys\n2 French Alps \u2014 snow-capped mountains ideal for thrilling snowsports and apr\u00e8s-ski elegance\n3 French Riviera \u2014 super beaches, superyachts and the super-wealthy\n4 \u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res \u2014 a semblance of the Caribbean in the azure waters of the Var\n5 Luberon \u2014 the stereotypical rural Provence of sleepy villages, joie de vivre and wine (these last two not necessarily being linked)\n6 Mercantour National Park \u2014 seven mountain valleys with hiking trails, this is where the Provence shows its wild side. Lucky travellers may catch glimpses of chamois, ibex, golden eagles and even wolves.\n7 Mont Ventoux \u2014 the largest mountain in the region has been nicknamed the \"Giant of Provence\" or \"The Bald Mountain\"\n8 Verdon Gorge \u2014 beautiful turquoise river canyon, great for kayaking, hiking, rock-climbing or just driving around the limestone cliffs\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nProvence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur covers all the original territory of Provence, together with what used to be the Italian-controlled County of Nice. The term \"Provence\" comes from the fact that this area - \"Transalpine Gaul\" - was the first part of what is now France to become a Roman province; it was from here that Julius Caesar launched his famous conquest of Gaul. The region's identity is associated closely with its history and culture. Although a bit stereotyped now (those lavender fields and hill villages that plaster postcards and guidebooks), contemporary Proven\u00e7al life is rooted in a long heritage of lively regional culture and language.\nThis is a vast and beautiful region, and merits a long trip, not just a few days or a week. To truly appreciate this region, you must be the type of traveller who likes food, wine and local crafts. It is recommended that you plan your own itinerary, and make it flexible enough so you can linger at an outdoor caf\u00e9 or appreciate a historic sight when the moment takes you. There is a joie de vivre attitude throughout the region which is contagious, especially after a picnic of cheese and sausage bought direct from local farmers, and two glasses of a good ros\u00e9.\n\n\nClimate\nThe low-lying parts of this region have a Mediterranean climate, so are generally dry and warm for most of the year, with more rain and wind over the usually brief winters. Summers here are hot and long, and the number of sunshine hours is very high all year round. The higher zones stretching up into the Alps have a mountain climate which, though still dry in summer, can be quite cool. This southernmost part of the Alps is the sunniest in the range, though winter snow is still common.\n\n\nRead\nThose interested in literary interpretations of Proven\u00e7al life should look up the works of Marcel Pagnol and Peter Mayle, the latter only if wealthy British expats are your cup of tea. Specifically, Mayle's French Lessons: Adventures with Knife, Fork, and Corkscrew also gives a bunch of practical tips and recommendations for every district of the Provence, as well as which areas to visit for their gastronomy.\n\n\nTalk\n\nFrench is of course the official language of this region, but you'll find that many locals have a regional accent. The e at the end of words is often pronounced softly in Provence, whereas in standard French, it is not pronounced at all. For example, the word \"Provence\" in standard French ends with an \"s\" sound, as \"proh-VAHNSS\", whereas in Provence itself, it will often end with a sound resembling a short English \"eh\", as \"proh-VEN-seh\". Many vowels are changed as well, so that they are pronounced in a manner somewhat closer to the English pronunciation of the written vowels. However, standard French is understood by the locals.\nThis accent is largely due to the fact that several generations ago a different language - Occitan or la langue d'Oc - was the dominant local tongue such that most locals only learnt French at school. The dialect of Occitan spoken in Avignon is Proven\u00e7al, and was the subject of strong preservation attempts in the early 1900s on the part of a group of writers and artists known as the F\u00e9librige. The most famous of these was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1908. Despite the efforts of the F\u00e9librige, the language has now largely disappeared, though it is still spoken by a minority of the local population. It is also taught in some regional universities and courses run by non-profit groups. In certain areas, road signs are bilingual, with place-names and some local information being printed in both standard French and Occitan.\nTravellers interested in speaking some French or Occitan can check out Wikivoyage's French and Proven\u00e7al phrasebooks.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe two major airports for the region are Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur and Marseille-Provence. Most transatlantic flights to France land at Paris Charles de Gaulle, from where it is possible to travel to the Provence either by catching a connecting flight, using a high speed train, or hiring a car and driving.\n\n1 Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport (NCE IATA). France's third busiest airport after the two in Paris welcomes flights from pretty much every major European airport and a handful of places further afield, such as Beirut (summer only), Doha, Dubai, Montreal Trudeau (summer only), New York JFK and Newark (summer only) and Tel Aviv Ben Gurion.   (updated Dec 2017)\n2 Marseille Provence Airport (MRS IATA). Has year round services from such European cities as Amsterdam Schiphol, Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld, Brussels Capital, Frankfurt, London (Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted), Istanbul IST, Madrid Barajas, Paris (Charles de Gaulle and Orly), Rome Fiumicino and Stockholm Arlanda. There are also year-round flights from cities in Francophone Africa such as Agadir, Algiers, Constantine, Dakar, Oran and Tunis.   \n3 Toulon-Hy\u00e8res Airport (TLN IATA). The only year-round flights arrive from Brest, Charleroi, Paris Orly and CDG. There are summer connections from Copenhagen, Rotterdam and Southampton.   \n4 Avignon Provence Airport (AVN IATA). The only scheduled flights here go to Antwerp in the high season only.   (updated Jul 2023)\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in France\nRail connections are excellent. The TGV (train \u00e0 grande vitesse, high-speed train) gets you down to the Mediterranean sun in about three hours from Paris, and just over an hour from Lyon. There are also high-speed connections from Spain jointly operated by the SNCF and Spanish company Renfe; this allows you to reach Marseille from Barcelona Sants in 4 hrs 41 mins, and from Madrid Atocha in 8 hrs. Rail connections from the east (i.e. Italy) and west (i.e. Occitan cities such as Montpellier and Toulouse) are somewhat slower, but regular connections are provided by SNCF Intercit\u00e9s (within France) and Thello, from Milan and Genoa to Nice and Marseille.\nFrom northern Europe, too, there are many possible routes. The TGV has connections as far afield as Brussels Midi/Zuid and Frankfurt\nHauptbahnhof, while Eurostar operates direct services from London Saint Pancras to Avignon TGV (5 hrs 49 mins) and Marseille Saint Charles (6 hrs 27 mins), via Lyon. In July and August, trains run five times a week from the British capital; from April to June and September to October, the service operates three times a week, and from November to March it runs once weekly (on Saturdays). At other times, travellers coming from the UK may catch the Eurostar to Lille or Paris and make the connection onto the domestic TGV network.\nTypical rail gateways include Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Marseille and Nice. You can easily use one of these cities as a base for exploring the region.\n\n\nBy car\nSee also: Driving in France\nFrance has an extensive and comprehensive motorway network that is well-maintained and often free of congestion. Enter PACA from Lyon and the north via the A7, from Liguria and the rest of Italy via the A8, and from the west (Montpellier, Toulouse, Spain) via the A9.\nIf you're travelling from elsewhere in the country, or from nearby Italy or Spain, driving may be the way to go. However, because of the price of petrol and most of the motorways being toll roads, visitors coming from the UK and northern Europe may think twice before getting behind the wheel. At any rate, with typical (non-stop) driving times from the Eurotunnel terminal and the English Channel ports being around 10 hours, the journey is long but doable. Some northerners who plan to tour the region by car or by campervan choose to make the initial journey part of their trip, making stops on the way down.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car and bicycle\nThe region can be easily explored by car or bicycle, using the easily-navigated and dense network of country roads and highways. With a village every ten minutes by car, and something interesting around every corner, Provence is one of those places where getting lost can work in your favour.\nStill, for longer journeys, you will want to know where you're going. The main autoroutes (motorways) of the region are:\n\nA7: Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, from Lyon, Orange (A9), Avignon, Alpilles / Luberon, Salon-de-Provence (A54), A8 for Aix-en-Provence, A51, Marseille (A50, A55)\nA8: A7, Aix-en-Provence (A51), A52, Brignoles, A57, Draguignan, Fr\u00e9jus, Cannes, Nice, Monaco, Menton, Italy, towards Imperia and Genoa\nA9: Orange (A7), Occitanie, towards N\u00eemes and Montpellier\nA50: Marseille (A7, A55), Aubagne (A52), La Ciotat, Toulon (A57)\nA51: A7 from Marseille, Aix-en-Provence (A8), Manosque for Luberon / Verdon, Gap, the Hautes-Alpes, continues as N85 into Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, towards Grenoble\nA52: A8 near Aix, Aubagne, A50 towards La Ciotat\nA54: A7 / Salon-de-Provence, Arles, Occitanie, towards N\u00eemes\nA55: Marseille (A7, A50), Martigues, Camargue\nA57: Toulon (A50), A570 to Hy\u00e8res, inland Var, A8\n\n\nBy train\nThe main lines operated by the national company SNCF are:\n\nAlong the coast between Marseille and the Italian border, with both local and TGV trains, though all the trains runs at normal speed.\nFrom Marseille and Aix into the Alps: Digne-les-Bains, Gap.\nFrom Marseille west to Avignon and on towards the south-west of France and along the Rh\u00f4ne river.\nA full map of services in the region can be downloaded from the SNCF website.\nLocal trains are prone to delays, so plan some margin if you have to change for a TGV or a flight. This region is one of the most impacted in the country by rail strikes when they happen. Usually long-distance trains are not impacted, and strikes rarely last longer than one day, but the few  trains that do run are packed with commuters.\nThere is also a \"small\" line (meter gauge), the  Chemins de Fer de Provence that links Nice with Dinge-les-Bains.\n\n\nSee\n\nProvence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur is a region of artists, and many of the greats have been inspired by the vibrant colours and excellent light quality that the landscape offers. Nice has museums dedicated to Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse, while Vence has Matisse's stunning Rosary Chapel. Tragically, there are no paintings by Vincent van Gogh left anywhere in Provence, but the town where he was most productive - Arles - pulls in the crowds because it still has many of the sights the great artist pictured like no-one else ever had. For something a little different, you can't go wrong with Le Corbusier's monument to brutalism, the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation tower block in Marseille. Avignon has a large contemporary art museum, the Collection Lambert, with a range of works all produced since the 1960s. The city also has an unmissable summer theatre festival for three-and-a-half weeks every July.\nThe region is known on the world stage for its glitz and glamour, none more so than in the Riviera. Whether you're drawn to see millionaires' yachts at Saint-Tropez, rub shoulders with film stars at Cannes, go to the pools in Monaco, or just soak up the atmosphere of the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, there are many ways to get a taste of the celebrity lifestyle. The Riviera is also known for its luxury homes, and some of the most famous open their doors to tourists. For instance, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat has the insanely opulent graecian Villa K\u00e9rylos, and the Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild, which is surrounded by nine spectacular themed gardens.\nLovers of historical buildings can't go wrong in PACA, and there are examples from all eras to see. The Romans more than left their mark here, and Arles is the most blessed, with sights including a very well-preserved amphitheatre which is still used for festivities, the subterranean cryptoporticus and Roman baths. For a slice of living Roman history, the UNESCO-listed Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antique d'Orange is a stunning 1st century outdoor theatre - if you visit in summer (end of June to beginning of August), you can go and see the opera there! A more low-key, but still impressive, offering from antiquity is the Roman bridge in Vaison-la-Romaine. The 14th century brought crisis to the Roman Catholic Church, and the western Popes upped sticks and built themselves an enormous Gothic palace - the largest building of its style - in Avignon. The building is still standing in all its majesty, though the interior is now quite sparse due to a spot of bother in the French Revolution. Provence is also known for its medieval hill towns; one of the best known is Gordes - all golden stone and cypress trees - while the much rockier Les Baux-de-Provence is overlooked by the ruins of its ch\u00e2teau.\n\n\nDo\n\nWhat's the most Proven\u00e7al sport you can think of? Go to any town square or public park in the region and chances are you'll see groups of older men playing p\u00e9tanque. The aim of this southern French variation of boules is to roll one's own metal balls as close to the cochonnet (a little wooden ball known in English as a \"jack\", although cochonnet actually means \"piglet\"!) as possible, knocking out other players' ball in the process; the player whose ball is closest to the cochonnet at the end wins the game. Visitors wishing to try it out can usually find a cheap set on sale in supermarkets and larger towns even have their own p\u00e9tanque courts. More adventurous travellers may even volunteer to join a locals' game. If you are friendly and polite, the other players will most likely jump at the chance to share their sport with a foreigner and this can be a great way to try out your French on the locals. But be warned\u02d0 despite the game's relaxed reputation, competition can get quite fierce among more seasoned players\u01c3\n\n\nBuy\nVisit the production centres of some of Provence's most famous exports. Vineyards (vignobles), olive groves (oliveraies) and lavender fields (champs de lavande) can be found all over the region, and many offer you the chance to \"try before you buy\". The Visites Gourmandes website is useful for locating such places. Each of these products is grown by season, so the best time to visit the producers varies: lavender fields bloom from June to August, particularly around the Dr\u00f4me, Luberon and Vaucluse; vines come to fruition between September and November; olive trees are harvested in November and December. In addition to edible produce, Provence is one of the world's leading centres of perfume. The most prestigious perfumeries (parfumeries) are concentrated around the town of Grasse. All sell to the general public, and three prestigious maisons (Fragonard, Galimard and Molinard) are also open to visitors.\nDon't miss out on the march\u00e9s hebdomadaires (or weekly markets), laden with an enormous array of produce. Expect to see everything from wonderfully local breads to meats and cheeses, fresh seafood as well as herbs, citrus fruits, olives and figs, not to mention artisan crafts and the ubiquitous lavender. As in much of France, locals are fiercely proud of their region's produce, and with such a diverse repertoire, you can hardly blame them\u01c3\n\n\nEat\n\nCenturies of intense study of the culinary arts has produced a country where the food is almost invariably excellent. It is difficult to have a bad meal because French standards are so high. Nonetheless, in tourist traps there are places where standards slip, but to avoid this the classic tip is to choose restaurants that are busy with locals.\nEach village in the region has a market day. You can buy local fare such as breads, cheeses, sausage, olives and preserves straight from the farmers and take them (the food that is, not the farmers\u01c3) for a picnic while exploring the countryside.\nIf you are going out for a sit-down meal, there are three main types of dining experiences to choose from. Restaurants are more formal in France, serving full dinner menus and at a pace that is slower than in, say, North America. You are expected to enjoy the food and it should be the main reason for going out. It is considered inappropriate to request that a dish be prepared in a different way than is stated on the menu. Restaurants usually have a selection of set menus, each with a different price range. You can also choose from a list of \u00e0 la carte items. A bistrot is more casual and has more individual items, while a caf\u00e9 is more casual still, serving press coffee, drinks, sandwiches (such as the ubiquitous croque monsieur) or pizzas.\nProvence has a unique cuisine that reflects its Mediterranean history and frequent exchange of cultures. This is an olive-growing region, and there are many varieties, ranging from the tiny peanut size Ni\u00e7ois olives to the large Bouteillan or Aups olives. Other than oil, olives are also enjoyed as spreads either alone (Olivade) or mixed with capers (Tapenade). Many producers offer guided visits of their groves; these can be smallholding-sized plots but some are set in the grounds of real ch\u00e2teaux.\nWhile many products are found all over the region, some are best sampled in certain areas. Let it be known that despite the region's bounty of native fare, the Provence has a highly popular pizzeria culture. OK, now that that announcement is out of the way, let's move on to some real Proven\u00e7al cuisine\u01c3\nOn the coast, most of the cooking is fish-based, with sardines and anchovies being the most popular. For English speakers, the region's two best-known plats are of course bouillabaisse, a fish stew rich in herbs and spices, and the famous salade ni\u00e7oise, a tunafish salad made with eggs, anchovies, tomatoes, green beans and black olives. While sampling both of these is a must, other lesser-known but equally tasty dishes include anchoiade, which is an anchovy-based ap\u00e9ritif spread, garlicky aioli and a Marseille speciality\u02d0 grilled sardines. Another wonderful Proven\u00e7al speciality is the savoury soupe de poissons, which is made with a base of tomatoes, onion, garlic and herbs and often served with croutons, grated gruy\u00e8re cheese and a very spicy aioli.\nIn the hills, easily the most famous and best-loved dish is ratatouille, which in real life is even better than a certain Pixar film shows it to be. Though it be but a simple vegetable stew, and a peasant dish to boot, ratatouille is a very special mix of fresh courgette (US\u02d0 zucchini), mushrooms, aubergine (US\u02d0 eggplant), bell peppers, tomatoes and onion as well as garlic and Proven\u00e7al herbs. In season, one can also enjoy stuffed vegetables (farcis) that are typical of rustic cooking. If the thought of all those vegetables is making you queasy, here's one for the carnivores. Daube is a scrumptious beef stew that is often mixed with olives.\nFor dessert, the trop\u00e9zienne cake is not to be missed. This fluffy sponge-cake will cool you down nicely in the summer inferno. At the other end of the year, you may experience a unique Christmas ritual that will have pudding lovers salivating\u02d0 at the end of the Christmas meal, no fewer than thirteen desserts are served\u01c3 Which particular thirteen is a hotly-debated question (debate being one of the Proven\u00e7al people's favourite activities). Despite the disagreement, an official list has been drawn up which encompasses: pompe \u00e0 huile, the so-called \"four beggars\" (nuts, dried figs, almonds and raisins), dates, apples, pears, water melon, grapes, both black and white nougat and sorbet.\n\n\nDrink\n\nMost of the wine in this region is of very high quality and must be tasted\u01c3 If this seems like a ludicrous and impractical task for the average holidaymaker, then why not try the locals' favourite\u02d0 a good ros\u00e9. Totally unlike the sweet, cheap crap many of us remember from the 1970s, traditional Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 is dry, light and acts as a perfect accompaniment to an afternoon picnic of bread and cheese.\nViticulture aside, the drink most endeared to the Proven\u00e7al psyche is pastis, an ap\u00e9ritif liqueur made from anise. The many brands may be indistinguishable to outsiders but each one has a devoted local following, similar to sports teams and their fans. With an average alcohol content of 40-45%, this is strong stuff and will likely lead to some memorable nights (or not, depending on how much you indulge in\u01c3)\nFancy yourself a super spy at heart? Sipping a Martini (\"shaken, not stirred\" or however you like) while on a night out in the Riviera? When you order a Martini in France, you must be very specific. Don't just say \"Martini\", as for many French barmen, this means sweet vermouth ap\u00e9ritif on the rocks, as in a red or white Martini and Rossi. Better ask for a 'gin Martini', 'vodka Martini' or 'American Martini', and specify your preferred style like stirred, lemon zest, dry, etc.\nIf alcohol isn't your thing, or if you just fancy a break from all that Pastis, the region's excellent range of fruit trees yield a healthy fruit juice crop, and French coffee culture is ubiquitous.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nIn an emergency, dial 112.\nIf you decide that the Provence is your place to stay, you might as well stay safe. The last 10 years have seen a sharp rise in the crime rate on C\u00f4te d'Azur, with many houses burgled. Help and information for victims of burglary and those who want to check or improve the security of their property is best done with the assistance of the local police chief. If you decide to make the Provence your base and you are looking to buy a property, you should be just as cautious as in anywhere else. Don't just buy your property without doing the necessary research. Make sure you buy your property through a listed agent who is in possession of a \"permit\".\nIn addition to that, many cities in the region like Marseille, Nice, and Toulon have their share of pickpocketing and muggings. \n\n\nGo next\nCatch a ferry from Nice, Toulon or Marseille to Corsica, known in French as \"L'\u00eele de Beaut\u00e9\" (the \"Island of Beauty\").\nGo north to Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, and explore landscapes as diverse as the upper Rhone valley and the high French Alps.\nGo west to Occitanie, a region which curves along the coast until it collides with the Pyrenees and Spanish Catalonia.\nGo east into Italy, where the wealthy regions of Liguria and Piedmont await you.",
