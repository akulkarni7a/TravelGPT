  "extract": "Florian\u00f3polis (\"Floripa\" for short) is a coastal city in southern Brazil, the capital of the state of Santa Catarina. Most of the city's area consists of the island of Santa Catarina, connected to the mainland by two bridges, and only a small part of the island can really be called urban\u2014the rest is full of gorgeous beaches and nature, including a large lagoon. Though famous for its beaches, Floripa also has great hikes and beautiful forested mountains. Here you can enjoy the outgoing culture and natural beauty of coastal Brazil in a less dangerous place than Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, or Recife.\nFlorian\u00f3polis gets busy in the summer, when its population of about 500,000 swells with tourists (both domestic and foreign) to 1.5 million. Naturally, this causes lots of traffic and generally strains the local infrastructure, so it's better to come in the off-season if you can. Make sure to visit when the weather is nice so you can enjoy all the outdoor activities.\n\n\nUnderstand\nFlorianopolis is on an island of 424.4 km\u00b2 (54 km by 18 km) (163.9 square miles) in the Atlantic Ocean, and a small peninsula of 1210 km\u00b2 on the mainland of southern Brazil. Three bridges link the island to the continent, including the Herc\u00edlio Luz Bridge, a landmark of the city.\nFlorianopolis has become a popular destination in Brazil for people who are looking for superb beaches, beautiful scenery, interesting culture and friendly people. It has also experienced a real estate boom, with Brazilians looking for a better quality of life away from the chaos of the big cities, especially from the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. The City proper has an estimated population of 420,000 people. The Greater Florianopolis metropolitan area is home to about 1 million people.\nThe northern beach resorts Jurer\u00ea, Daniela, Canasvieiras, Brava and Ingleses get very busy during the summer and there are plenty of hotels, restaurants and other conveniences for the tourist. Eastern beaches, like Joaquina, Mole and Mo\u00e7ambique are among the best surfing beaches and popular with young people. Beaches heading south include Campeche, Arma\u00e7\u00e3o and Morro das Pedras, which are all very beautiful and also good for surfing. Isolated and unspoilt beaches, like Lagoinha do Leste and Naufragados, can be found at the southern end of the island and can only be reached only by trail. Lagoa da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o is a famous natural attraction, and the centerpiece of the island; it is relatively shallow, with high winds making it a world-class location for windsurfing. Peri Lagoon is quieter, on the other hand, and great for nature walks.\nFlorianopolis is quite modern with large shopping malls, chain and high-end restaurants and many bars and nightclubs. The highway system serving the city is very good, though traffic can get bad in the tourist season.\nThe island is known as \"Ilha da Magia\" or Magic Island, probably because of its incredible natural beauty, more than 100 beaches with 42 being well known, rocks, mountains, lakes, lagoons, waterfalls, bays, inlets, rich houses and buildings and young population and visitors. Florian\u00f3polis is also known for its high standards of living since it is located in the rich area of Brazil. Since the attraction is also heat, the best months to visit the island are December\u2013March. The winter in South Brazil might be cooler than tourists expect.\n\n\nClimate\n\nFlorian\u00f3polis has a subtropical climate with defined seasons. There is no dry season, but it rains more in summer. The summer months are hotter, sunny and humid, and in the summer, the sea has a pleasant temperature for swimming. There may be occasional showers of rain, which only last for a few minutes and then sunny weather returns. The average temperature reaches up to 29 \u00baC (84 \u00baF) in January and the lows can be 20 \u00baC (68 \u00baF) in December.\nWinters, despite being drier, are quite cold, windy and unsuitable for spending time on the beach, with the exception of surfers, since at this time the ocean waves get higher. Average temperatures at this time vary between average highs of 21 \u00baC (70 \u00baF) and average lows of 13 \u00baC (55 \u00baF).\n\n\nTalk\nAlthough Florian\u00f3polis is the second most visited city by foreigners in Brazil, most locals are monolingual Portuguese speakers, as in practically all of Brazil. Due to the strong number of tourists coming from Argentina and Uruguay, Spanish is also used in many hotels and tourist facilities. However, you are unlikely to find English speakers except in a few very touristy hotels.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Herc\u00edlio Luz International Airport (FLN  IATA), Av. Diom\u00edcio Freitas, 3393 (12 km from the city center), \u260f +55 48 3331-4000, fax: +55 48 3331-4111. Connected to the city by local bus lines or taxi.   \nThe Brazilian airline LATAM provides international and domestic services to Florian\u00f3polis. Flights are available from JFK International (NYC), Miami, Madrid, London, Frankfurt, Milan, Paris and main cities in South America. Most of the flights require a connection in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nAirlines Gol, Avianca and Azul operate domestic flights to the city. Gol also operates destinations in South America, like Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Santiago.\nSummer months (December through March) several daily charter flights arrive from Argentina and Chile.\n\n\nBy bus\n2 Terminal Rita Maria, Av. Paulo Fontes 1101 (in the city center), \u260f +55 4832123100. It links Florian\u00f3polis to the main Brazilian cities and to most of the cities in Santa Catarina state, as well as capitals and major cities in Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. The main bus companies operating in Florianopolis are Catarinense, Reunidas, Santo Anjo and Eucatur. The terminal has free WiFi. (updated Jun 2018)\nDestinations include:\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Many early morning and late afternoon connections for around R$125, 12 hr.\nFoz do Igua\u00e7u \u2013 The night trip takes around 12-14 hr. There are several late afternoon/evening connections for R$180-350. Instead of the expensive leito bus, you might just opt for a flight, which costs the same.\nCiudad del Este \u2013 Two daily connections. From Ciudad del Este at 15:30 and 17:00, 14-15 hr, GS.270,000.\n\n\nBy car\nYou should use the Route BR-101 (cross Brazil from north to south), the entrance to Florianopolis will be at km 206. From there read the signs and get the express route BR-282 which leads to Florianopolis.\n\n\nGet around\n\nFrom the city center, dozens of buses go to all the beaches on the island. The bus system has drawbacks since transfers are necessary at regional terminals to get around. The cost for riding the buses is R$6 (June 2023), and it takes about 35-60 minutes to get from the city center to the beaches. Additionally, there is an air-conditioned yellow bus (Linhas Executivas) that goes direct to downtown from the main beaches for R$15 (June 2023). A car is recommended to explore all the beaches and places of interest. There are car rentals on the island and at the airport. Renting can be expensive (R$120/day with A/C), but can be worthwhile as it makes exploring the island more convenient. During the high season traffic can be intense, and could easily take 2 hours to get to the beach from the city center.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Cruz e Sousa Palace. Near Pra\u00e7a XV de Novembro.

Many tourist areas are well policed and safe, and you'll see people walking around and using their phones outside, even at night. But this is still Brazil, there are still favelas, and robberies do happen, so know where you're going and take sensible security precautions:\n\nBe mindful of your personal belongings, especially in busy tourist areas, beaches and on public transport;\nPay special attention to your valuables, such as cash, passports and electronic devices;\nDon't trust strangers, especially those who seem excessively helpful;\nAvoid showing valuables such as clothes, jewelry or expensive watches that make you stand out;\nAvoid withdrawing and carrying large amounts of money.\n\n\nCurrents\nSome beaches in Florian\u00f3polis can have strong currents, especially in the winter months, between May and September, when the waves tend to be bigger, and on the beaches to the east of the island (such as Joaquina, Ingleses, Praia Mole, Barra da Lagoa, Arma\u00e7\u00e3o and Campeche), which are more directly exposed to ocean winds. It is important that you follow the advice of local lifeguards, respect safety flags and avoid swimming in unsupervised areas.\n\n\nStay healthy\nAs elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Florian\u00f3polis are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of the bathing report (in Portuguese, relat\u00f3rio de balneabilidade) of the state's Environment Department (IMA).\n\n\nGo next\nBalne\u00e1rio Cambori\u00fa\nS\u00e3o Joaquim\nLaguna\nGaropaba",
