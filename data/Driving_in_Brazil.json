  "extract": "Driving is sometimes the best option to get around Brazil, due to the poor quality of most cities' public transportation. Any foreigner is allowed to drive for up to 180 days with their country's driving license, unless it expires earlier. After the 180-day period, you must apply for some tests in order to obtain a Brazilian license. Citizens of a few countries might be eligible to acquire a Brazilian driving licence without going through the usual procedure due to bilateral agreements. If in doubt, check with the Brazilian consulate or embassy closest to you.\n\n\nUnderstand\nBrazilian roads can vary drastically from city to city in terms of quality. Due to the lack of sufficient highway/traffic police staff, it's easy to witness drivers doing otherwise forbidden actions such as driving on the shoulder, going above the speed limit, overtaking in dangerous situations, etc., but this does not apply to most drivers. Brazilians drive on the right side of the road, with the steering wheel on the left side. Most cars are manual, but the automatic ones are getting more and more common.\n\n\nRoads\n\nRoads that connect one state to another are federal highways known as BR-000, in which \"000\" should be replaced by another three-digit number. If this number starts with 0, then the highway starts at Bras\u00edlia and runs towards the extremes of the country; highways starting with 1 run north-south, whereas the ones starting with 2 cross the country from east to west; highways starting with 3 run northwest-southeast or northeast-southwest. There are also highways starting with 4, which run in any direction, and some that start with 6 and connect federal highways to one another.\nState highways are inside a single state, and instead of \"BR\" there'll be the two-letter code of the state (e.g. SP-160 stands for S\u00e3o Paulo State Highway 160). Both federal and state highways can be either motorways or divided or undivided highways with at grade crossings. In addition there are of course minor roads that usually aren't paved \u2014 indeed out of the country's 1,750,000 km (1,090,000 mi) of roads about 5.5% is paved.\nRoads can be government-financed only, or they may have some tolls. The price may vary from R$1,50 to R$20,00 depending on the road, the number of booths spread along the highway and the type of vehicle you are driving. Prices are usually displayed at the booths and in signs placed a few kilometers before each of them.\nMany highways have speed guns to prevent motorists from going too fast, but their presence and the speed limits must be informed according to the law. However, their exact location may remain unknown for motorists, so it's always best to respect the signs.\nHighways may become congested during the beginning and the end of holidays, or during rush hour, if they run near major cities. If the traffic stops inside a tunnel and there's no sign that you are going to move too soon, drivers are advised to turn the engine off. There are usually fewer cars late at night, but due to the low visibility, it also becomes more dangerous, especially for inexperienced drivers. Motorists should also be careful with truck drivers, since many of them sleep very few hours a day and may fall asleep at the wheel.\nMany roads are in good condition, especially in the east and south of the country and along the coast. In other areas and outside the metropolitan regions there are also gravel and dirt roads for which an off-road vehicle can be strongly recommended. This especially applies to the Amazon area where many roads are difficult or not at all passable during the rainy season from November to March. You should drive with a good map and well informed about distances, road conditions and the estimated travel time.\n\n\nSigns and regulations\n\n\nGeneral\n\nBrazilian road and traffic signs in general follow international conventions, in a mixture of the US MUTCD and FN Vienna convention standards. The Vienna round blue-and-white mandatory and red-and-white prohibition sign classes are all red-and-white, crossed over if about a prohibition, otherwise a mandatory instruction. Warning signs are black and yellow diamonds. Text is used more sparingly than in the US.\nStop signs are the red octagonal signs found in most of the world, with the text \"PARE\" meaning stop in Portuguese. These signs require a vehicle to stop at an intersection and not proceed until the way is clear. Stopping is mandatory, no matter what time of day or the traffic conditions. Sometimes, the PARE sign may be written on the ground, in white letters. The \"give way\" sign is displayed in an equilateral, red-edged triangle pointed downwards. They are normally displayed at accesses to highways or smaller roads, and mean you should only merge onto the larger road if the way is clear. In general, Brazil prefers yield signs, while stop signs are reserved for intersections with poor visibility and large speed differentials. Four-way stop signs are very rare and if no stop or yield sign is present, right of way should be given to the vehicle on your left. If vehicles are on opposite sides of an unsignalised intersection, right of way is given in order of action: right turn, then straight, then left turn. \"Rolling stops\" are very common in Brazil and mostly ignored by traffic agents, but they are still illegal and you can be fined by doing them.\n\n\nRoad markings\nRoads are mostly marked by yellow or white lines. Yellow lines always separate each side of the road. If they are continuous, overtaking is prohibited (though few people respect that). If they are dashed, it's okay to overtake. White lines separate lanes going in the same direction and the continuous/dashed rule applies to switching lanes. Some may be painted transversally at intersections, marking the point at which you should stop at red lights or stop signs. Some cities also designate an area at traffic lights for motorcyclists to stop, ahead of the other vehicles.\nSome cities have bus lanes. In general, these lanes are forbidden for cars unless the car is a taxi, or during specific times and days. If the bus lane is on the far right lane, vehicles may only use them when entering or exiting the street. Bus lanes marked with blue lines are exclusive to public transport, meaning the driver can receive a ticket for using them unless they're entering or exiting the street. These will often be monitored by cameras and in most cases you will be fined if you are caught by two consecutive cameras, but some systems will use a single photo as proof of an infraction. Some bus lanes are marked with regular white lines, and the word \"\u00d4nibus\" (Portuguese for bus) written on the ground, also in white paint. These lanes are preferential rather than exclusive, and any driver can use them, although it is common courtesy to avoid them in heavy traffic situations.\n\n\nPedestrian crossings\nZebra crossings (faixas de pedestres) are always painted as white, parallel lines. Some may be even highlighted in other colors such as purple or red and elevated. When there is a zebra crossing with no traffic light, drivers are supposed to stop and wait until the road is totally clear of pedestrians. However, obedience to this law is poor, particularly in major cities. In S\u00e3o Paulo, police enforcement has been increased, and the number of people hit by cars decreased, but the streets may still be dangerous for pedestrians if they do not pay attention. Also, some green lights may be too short for elderly or disabled people to completely cross the road.\n\n\nSpeed limits\n\nUnless otherwise specified, speed limits in Brazil are normally as follows:\n\nResidential/local streets: 30 km/h;\nMulti-lane avenues: 60 km/h;\nHighways (urban areas): 80 km/h for light vehicles, 60 km/h for heavy vehicles;\nHighways (rural areas): 110 km/h for light vehicles, 80 km/h for heavy vehicles.\nThese may vary, but the speed limit will always be specified by signs (see the image to the right).\nIn places without speed guns, few people will respect the limits, so it is always best to stay in the slower lanes or let people overtake you if you don't want to disrespect the law.\n\n\nSpeed bumps\n\nMany Brazilian streets, avenues and sometimes even highways have speed bumps (lombadas or quebra-molas). They should all be well indicated with signs and yellow diagonal strips painted on them, but in less developed areas they may be hidden. In the states of Maranh\u00e3o and Par\u00e1, dips are more common, and reportedly make worse damage on the shocks.\n\n\nTraffic lights\nTraffic lights in Brazil are known as sem\u00e1foros, far\u00f3is or sinais, and standardized with red on top, yellow in the middle, and green at the bottom. Some may be horizontal, with red on the left, yellow in the middle and green on the right. In most cities traffic lights are placed after the intersection, but in some (even major cities such as Belo Horizonte) lights are placed before the intersection.\nThe lights work as follows:\n\nRed: stop and stay stopped until the light goes out. You cannot turn right on the red signal, even if this turn isn't against traffic, unless a direita livre sign is placed next to the traffic light.\nRed arrow: stop for the direction of the arrow.\nYellow: stop unless you cannot safely do so, because the lights are about to turn red.\nFlashing yellow: It means the lights are not working. Unless there is a traffic controller operating at the problematic intersection, the \"every driver for themselves\" rule applies, which means you'll have to somehow negotiate your way with every motorist around you. Some traffic lights, mainly those with the exclusive purpose of allowing pedestrian crossing are generally deactivated between 22:00 and 05:00 and will display the flashing yellow light.\nGreen: you may proceed unless the way ahead of you is not clear and you're not sure if it'll be until the lights turn red again. If you block the intersection, you may cause a traffic jam and be issued a fine.\nGreen arrow: you may proceed in the direction of the arrow, provided the conditions described above.\nRed and green person: used at pedestrian crossings beside the lights. Instead of a yellow light, the red light will flash when the lights are about to turn green for cars.\n\n\nSafety rules\nYou should wear your seat belt at all times when you are driving. Also, the number of functioning seat belts determines the number of passengers a vehicle can carry. It is mandatory to have your headlights on at all times when on a highway (Day-running lights (DRL) are allowed). Also, keep an eye on your tyres and the fire extinguisher's shelf life (the fire extinguisher is not mandatory, but if it is present, if must be in working order). If you have an emergency, stop with the emergency lights on and place the reflective triangle some 30 m away from your car, though a good rule is to use 1 meter of distance for every km/h allowed by the speed limit (80km/h = 80 meters from the stopped vehicle). Some drivers even put large branches on the shoulder to increase visibility. Do make sure to remove those after the situation is resolved if you choose to leave branches.\nCellphones are strictly forbidden without a hands-free device. A driver can be fined for as much as holding a cellphone, even if the car is not moving.\nIt is forbidden to drive shirtless, while wearing heels or any shoes that are not braced to the ankles, or with your elbow (or your arm) resting out of the window.\n\n\nChildren\nAccording to Brazilian law:\n\nChildren under the age of 10 must always ride in the back seat. If you're carrying more children than the back seat allows for, the tallest one is allowed to ride in the front seat. This does not apply for children under the age of 1;\nChildren under the age of 1 must ride in rear-facing seats;\nChildren between the ages of 1 and 4 must ride in front-facing seats;\nChildren between the ages of 4 and 7 must use booster seats.\n\n\nDrive\n\n\nDriver-to-driver communication\n\nBrazilian drivers will constantly use the blinker, the horn, flash their headlights and wave their hands to communicate with other motorists.\n\nIf you are exiting a parking lot, garage, gas station or something similar and trying to enter a street but there are too many cars, one of them may stop for you to come in. They will often make their intentions clear by flashing their lights, sounding their horns or making a \"come in\" gesture with their hands. Some will just stop and wait for you to enter. If you want to say \"thank you\", you may happily sound your horn \"beep-beep\", or make a \"thumbs-up\" sign with your hand. If you are on a two-way street and want to make a left turn, the oncoming vehicles may use the same signals described above to give you passage.\nIf the oncoming cars start flashing their lights on you, they may be warning you about possible hazards ahead, for instance in rural areas it's common that domestic animals are left at the roadside, and they sometimes wander into the traffic. Some also do this to alert about police checkpoints, called blitz (plural: blitzes). However be aware that the practice of flashing your lights to communicate with other vehicles while in motion is illegal, regardless of the intention.\nIf oncoming drivers signal you by raising their arms up and down outside the window, it means you should reduce your speed as there are possible hazards ahead.\nWhen driving in the fastest lane of a highway and the car behind you flashes its lights, or turns the left blinker on, the driver is asking you to get out of their way.\nMotorists also use the flashing lights and the horn to complain if you cut off in front of them.\nWhen switching lanes or entering major avenues and streets, some drivers may put their hands out of the car and make a \"slow down\" sign. This means they are really willing to get in your way, and you should just let them in.\nOn highways, if the car in front of you brakes and turns the emergency lights on, it means there is a sudden traffic jam or hazard ahead and you should stop as well. However be aware that using emergency lights while the vehicle is in motion is illegal and you can be fined for it.\n\n\nMotorcycles\nMotorcycles are a particular problem in Brazil, especially in major cities. With the recent rise in car prices and overreliance on \"gig economy\" jobs, the number of motorcycles on the streets has increased heavily. The high number of delivery drivers that need to make as many deliveries as possible in the shortest time possible results in many instances of reckless driving by motorcyclists, and in smaller cities many motorcyclists do not have licences and are uninsured. Many bikers die every day due to accidents. They ride between cars all the time, so be extremely careful when switching lanes. If you hit one of them, several others may gather around you and threaten you; try to avoid getting involved in an accident with them. Be careful also when taking a right or a left, for they may try to overtake you even if you turn the blinker on. If the traffic comes to a stop or in slow-moving traffic, make sure to leave enough space between you and the car next to you for bikers to go by, as some may be aggressive and damage your car if they can't get through, or they might damage it by accident while trying to squeeze between you and the vehicle next to you.\nMotorcycles are also the vehicle of choice for robbers, so be careful if you are approached by one of them at night, especially if there are two individuals on it.\n\n\nBicycles\nThe number of Brazilians that opt for bicycles is increasing, and some major cities, such as S\u00e3o Paulo, have been creating bike lanes. In places without bike lanes, bikers must ride on the shoulder (acostamento). If there are parked cars, they will go between them and the traffic. Try to keep a safe distance from them (around 1.5 m), and be sure they are at a safe distance when exiting the road. Many bikers don't wear any protection such as helmets, so any accident may cause them severe injuries. In highways with shoulders, bikers must cycle on that part of the road.\n\n\nParking\n\nMost streets and avenues are available for parking, except otherwise noted by signs such as the ones to the right. Some streets might have paid parking, but most cities do not use parking meters, with payment instead being done through an app or by buying a sheet that you fill and place in a visible spot within the car. This varies from city to city, so make sure to check what applies to your destination. In paid parking streets, signs will denote the areas and limitations.\n\n\nParking lots\nIn major cities, it is always easier and safer to leave your car in a paid parking lot. Large commercial establishments will also often offer parking. These parking lots, when paid, must inform their prices at their entrances. All of them must also have insurance for collisions, fires and theft. Under Brazilian law, parking lots are liable for any damage to your car and/or items inside. This also includes \"free parking\" offered by commercial establishments such as supermarkets and stores. However, most establishments will refuse to cover any damage other than theft or fire, and getting them to cover other damage might require extensive effort. As such, it is always best to take your valuables with you when you leave your vehicle. In some parking lots, you can park your car and take the keys. In others, you may be asked leave the car for someone to park it properly.\n\n\nFlanelinhas\nIn most major cities, some streets may have \"flanelinhas\", which are irregular workers, usually adult men, that look after parked cars and help people find parking spots in busy areas. Although the activity is illegal, enforcement is poor for this particular situation, and sometimes the cops allow those people free rein.\nThey will usually let you know they will be watching your car when you park and charge you when you return. If they ask for money in advance, it is not a good idea to refuse, as they may punish non-payers by popping their tires or by damaging their cars when  no one is watching. In worse cases, they may even threaten you verbally or physically. In most places giving them anything up to R$5,00 will be enough, but be aware that if you are parking your car near a major event (such as a concert or a football match), they might charge you upwards of R$100,00, and in those instances their threats are rarely empty. If you just don't feel like paying anyone, find a clear street or a private parking lot. Also, don't leave your keys with them if they ask you to. Some may be honest, but since you're never sure about their real intentions, you may have your car stolen as soon it's out of your sight.\n\n\nFuel, gas stations, and EV charging\n\nThere are many gas stations (postos de gasolina or simply postos) all over Brazil and along the major highways. Several types of fuel are available:\nAvailable at virtually all gas stations:\n\nRegular gasoline (gasolina comum): regulated by ANP (National Petroleum Agency) and must be E27.\nGasoline with additives (gasolina aditivada): E27 gasoline with cleaning additives. This type of gasoline often costs R$0,15 to R$0,50 more per litre, but there is no regulation on the additives, so it is usually not recommended as you might be paying more for regular gasoline.\nEthanol (etanol or \u00e1lcool): E95 hydrated ethanol.\nAvailable at select gas stations:\n\nPremium gasoline (gasolina premium): Only available at some Petrobras (Podium) or Shell (V-Power Racing) stations. Has higher octane rating. It costs around R$2,00 to R$5,00 more per litre than regular gasoline and will not provide noticeable improvements unless you are driving a car with a higher compression ratio, such as a sports car.\nEthanol with additives (etanol aditivado): Similar to gasolina aditivada, it's E95 ethanol with cleaning additives.\nS-10 and S-35 Diesel: Not readily available at all gas stations because diesel engines are not allowed in most types of passenger vehicles. Pickup trucks and SUVs can have diesel engines, however, so if you are renting in these categories, be aware that diesel might not be as easy to come by.\nNatural gas (g\u00e1s natural): Requires previous adaptation of the vehicle and virtually unheard of in rental vehicles. Mostly used by taxis and drivings schools.\nUnless absolutely necessary, never go to gas stations that don't belong to one of the major brands (Petrobras, Shell, Ipiranga and Ale), especially if they offer below-average prices. Such stations often scam customers by selling diluted fuel which can severely damage the vehicle. You have the right to request that the gas station test the fuel from the pump in front of you, and all are required to provide the guidelines and expected test results. If you request this test and they refuse or give any excuse, do not use their fuel.\nFuel is relatively expensive by Brazilian standards, but cheap by USA or European standards, with the gasoline prices ranging from R$ 5,50 to R$ 7,00 per liter (Sep 2024), depending on the region, brand and the location of the station. Most gas stations also sell fire extinguishers, gasoline additives and motor oil. Some also have convenience stores, toilets, showers and car-wash stations.\nMost cars in Brazil are equipped with flex fuel engines, meaning they can function with any mixture from 100% ethanol to 100% gasoline. Ethanol is cheaper than gasoline and results in a slightly more powerful response, but using ethanol increases consumption. As a general rule-of-thumb, ethanol should be used if its cost is not higher than 70% the cost of gasoline (i.e. if 1 liter of gasoline cost R$1,00, you should use ethanol if it costs R$0,70 per liter or less). Gas stations are required display the price of ethanol in relation to the price of regular gasoline on all pumps, but most do not. When driving for long distances, however, gasoline is often the best option since its reduced consumption and better efficiency at higher speeds allows for longer range and fewer fueling stops. \nUsing ethanol can also make it more difficult for the car to start, especially during a cold-start under lower temperatures. For this reason, some flex fuel cars have a separate reservoir at the front of the vehicle, called the \"cold-start reservoir\" (reservat\u00f3rio de partida a frio) which should be filled with (preferably) premium gasoline. When the engine detects a high quantity of ethanol in the fuel mix, it uses the gasoline from this reservoir to start the car. Newer engines no longer require this, but it is good to check the manual for the right information. It is also a good idea to make sure the engine runs for at least half an hour after switching from gasoline to ethanol or ethanol to gasoline, to make sure the engine's lambda sensor has enough time to detect the new mix and make the necessary adjustments. Imported vehicles, such as the ones available from rental companies on their high-end categories, will often be gasoline-only. If in doubt, always use gasoline. \nAll gas stations are serviced as self-service pumps are illegal in Brazil. The employees (called frentistas) will often offer to check the oil and water levels, but it is generally not advised to allow them to check, as they will often use this as an opportunity to offer a product or service that you do not really need, since many gas stations establish sales quotas that these workers must meet. In the case of highway gas stations, they will often offer to clean your windshield at no extra charge, although it is not impolite to tip them for those services.\nTyre inflation machines are available at virtually all gas stations and are usually self-service. Some stations may charge R$1,00 or R$2,00 for their use. PSI is the standard unit for tyre pressure. Gas station attendants will gladly inflate your tires for you if you ask them. Again, it is not impolite to tip them for this service.\nMost gas stations will accept credit cards as payment, although they may charge different prices for that payment method. Virtually all gas stations accept debit cards, charging the same price as for cash payments. Cash (reais) must be accepted as payment in any commercial establishment in Brazil.\nRunning out of fuel is considered lack of maintenance, just as illegal as driving with busted head/tail lights or bald tires. Keep the vehicle fueled to avoid being fined.\nGas stations are a traditional place to stop and ask for directions; frentistas are used to it. Bear in mind, however, that it is highly unlikely that they'll speak any language other than their native Portuguese.\nWith the rise in popularity and availability of electric vehicles, charging stations have become more common in larger cities. However, EV ownership in Brazil is still very much tied to the ability to charge the vehicle at home, as even in larger cities charging stations are not readily available, with most being inside paid parking lots such as in malls, and virtually non-existent in small cities and rural areas. Most rental companies will have EVs available, especially if you are picking up at a major airport, but be sure to check the availability of charging stations around your route.\n\n\nStay safe\nSee also: Brazil#Stay safe\n\n\nDriving at night\nAs mentioned before, driving at night may be dangerous in less developed areas due to the lack of visibility and street lights. It is always best to avoid stopping at the red lights due to the risk of being robbed. However, try not to do this before checking if there are no other cars crossing the intersection. If other cars around you stop, you should stop as well, unless you see someone suspicious approaching your car (never accelerate if the person is already too close, if it's a criminal, they may shoot at you). If the light ahead of you is red, slow down and approach it slowly, reducing the time you'll spend in a full stop. Avoid stopping at a red light with the windows open and always check your rearview mirrors for suspicious activity.\nHighways at night may have street racing or lone drivers that enjoy speeding: drive carefully and try to keep your distance from them.\nIf someone hits you at night, it may be a criminal forcing you to stop. Try leading them to a place with more people (say, a police station, a hospital, or a 24-hour gas station). Also, if your windshield gets hit by a stone or slime-jammed when you go under a pedestrian overpass, there is a high chance it was done by an ill-meaning person using another common way of forcing people to stop. If you can still see the road ahead of you, try stopping in a police station or any other place with people to ask for some help.\n\n\nRoad conditions\nIn Brazil, road conditions will vary wildly even within states. Using tools such as Google Maps and Google Street View is a good way of checking conditions on your route before setting off. Coverage of these tools in Brazil is extensive and updated frequently. Always be sure to check your brakes, lights and tyres before going on highways, especially for long distances, and remember to check the spare tyre, as it might be deflated. Also remember to check the tools in the car (jack, tyre iron, triangle) and make sure they are in good condition (you could be fined if they are absent or in bad condition). Brazilian law allows cars to be sold without a spare if they have a patch kit. If this is the case, make sure the kit is in good condition and that you have the number for your insurance handy, as more serious damage to the tyre will not be solved by the kit.\nIn many areas, especially in northern and northeastern Brazil, it might be dangerous to drive on highways at night, as criminals might block the road or try other methods to make you stop.\n\n\nAccidents\nIf you are involved in an accident, never leave the scene. If it is a minor accident, you and the other driver may stop somewhere else to discuss in order not to cause a traffic jam. It's possible but not likely that the other driver will speak English. If no one is injured or worse, it is not necessary to call the police, but it is very important to file an accident report. This can be done via the internet, and most police departments have english-language forms that will be easier for a tourist to fill. You can also go to a police station to file this report. File a report even if the other parties have fled the scene. If someone is injured or if one of the cars cannot be moved due to damage, you must call the police by dialing 190 (international numbers such as 911 or 999 will also direct you to the police). If there are victims, you must call an ambulance by dialing 192 (emergency services) or 193 (fire department), or by indicating to the police that an ambulance is required. According to Brazilian law, if you rear-end someone, the fault is generally yours, unless you can prove otherwise, which can be difficult unless you have a dash-cam or someone who witnessed the collision is willing to testify in the police report.\nAlso according to the law, in the case of an accident, the driver with the larger vehicle is responsible for making sure the driver and passengers of the smaller vehicles are safe and tended to by a trained first responder if necessary (i.e. if you hit a motorcycle with your car, you're responsible for making sure they're not hurt and, in case they are, you're responsible for calling an ambulance and see that they arrive and tend to the wounded). Fleeing the scene of an accident when there are victims is a criminal offense.\n\n\nDrunk driving\nBrazilian law is very strict on driving under the influence. You are only allowed to have 0.05 mg of alcohol for every liter of your blood, which means that even a can of beer may leave you unable to legally drive. The police efforts to reduce the number of people that drive under the influence have grown, but the number of drunk drivers is still high, in no small part due to the scarcity of night-time public transportation and lack of safety where it is available. Police presence is relatively high in bohemian neighborhoods and in cities that receive a great number of tourists during holidays. If you are stopped by the police, they cannot force you to blow into the breathalyzer, but if you are visibly intoxicated, they may arrest you and you may face criminal charges. Refusing to blow into the breathalyzer means you'll receive a steep fine for refusing to comply with a law-enforcement agent, and if there are licensed drivers willing to take the test to show they are not intoxicated, the car will be impounded all the same. If you do blow the breathalyzer, anything above 0.3 mg of alcohol per litre of blood is considered a criminal offense. \n\n\nSee also\nTips for road trips",
