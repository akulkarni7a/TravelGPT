Some regions, like Lloret de Mar, are more popular with foreign tourists, while others, like Begur, cater more to locals. \nThe region starts in Blanes and goes for over 200 km (120 mi) to the French border. It can be divided in 3 subregions, which match with the coastal area of the administrative counties (comarques): Alt Empord\u00e0, Baix Empord\u00e0 and La Selva.\nThere is a lot of history in the region dating back 2600 years with the ruins of Iberian villages, then Greek outposts and Roman cities. In mediaeval times the monastery of Sant Pere de Rodes was built.\nIn the early 2000s many Russians acquired villas around Costa Brava, inflating restaurant prices, and bringing many expensive cars to the region.\n\n\nTalk\nThe official language of the region is Catalan and as is the case everywhere in Catalonia, all the citizens are also fluent in Spanish. In this region, English is very widely spoken and quite often French as well. Some people will speak German, but the lingua franca is really English.\n\n\nGet in\nCosta Brava's main airport is Girona-Costa Brava airport. Ryanair operate flights to the airport from several destinations in Europe and Morocco all year. Other seasonal airlines include Thomson Airways and Transavia. Alternatively, you can fly into Barcelona El Prat Airport. Airport shuttles operate between Girona-Costa Brava airport and the majority of the resort cities, Barcelona and Girona city centre.\n\n\nGet around\nIf you want to explore a lot of the coastal cities then renting a car is your best option.  There is regular bus service between the towns but nothing compares driving along and stopping where you like.\n\n\nSee\nBeaches and coves\nThe Dali Museum in Figueres.\nMedieval ruins in Tossa de Mar, with some very well-preserved medieval ruins -- including walls and towers which protected the town between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries.\nTraditional fishing cities like Blanes and Lloret de Mar and towns like Cadaqu\u00e9s, Tossa de Mar and Pals that have become important destinations for internal Spanish tourism.\nVisit Region Natural Parks.
