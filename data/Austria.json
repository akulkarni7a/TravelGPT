  "extract": "Austria (German: \u00d6sterreich) is a landlocked German-speaking country in Central Europe. Austria, along with neighbouring Switzerland, is the winter sports centre of Europe. However, it is just as popular for summer tourists who visit its historic cities and villages and hike in the magnificent scenery of the Alps.\n\n\nRegions\nAustria is a federal republic comprised of nine states (Bundesl\u00e4nder):\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Vienna (Wien) \u2014 the largest city in Austria, as well as its cultural, economic, and political centre\n2 Bregenz \u2014 famous for the annual summer music festival of Bregenzer Festspiele\n3 Eisenstadt \u2014 historically the seat of the Eszterh\u00e1zy Hungarian noble family that gave the town its aristocratic feel\n4 Graz \u2014 known as Austria's culinary capital and student city\n5 Innsbruck \u2014 the cultural and economic centre of Western Austria\n6 Klagenfurt \u2014 scenic town very close to the W\u00f6rthersee\n7 Linz \u2014 a vibrant music and arts scene and a beautiful historic core\n8 Salzburg \u2014 the birthplace of Mozart; a city with an attractive setting and scenic Alpine backdrop\n9 Villach \u2014 beautiful Altstadt surrounded by the Alps and various lakes\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Lake Constance (Bodensee) \u2014 a large lake situated in Vorarlberg and shared with Switzerland and Germany\n2 Kaprun \u2014 part of the Europa Sport Region\n3 Pinswang \u2014 one of the most ancient settlements of the North Tyrolean Ausserfern, on the border with Bavaria and a short walk or drive to the famous castles of King Ludwig\n4 Salzkammergut \u2014 a stunning cultural landscape among mountains and lakes\n5 Igls \u2014 a popular ski resort in the shadow of the Patscherkofel mountain near Innsbruck\n6 Thermenland \u2014 the great spas of Styria, an easy daytrip from Graz or Vienna\n7 W\u00f6rthersee \u2014 one of Austria's warmest lakes\n8 Zell am See \u2014 one of the most important alpine tourist towns in Austria\n9 Eng \u2014 the largest alm in Europe and one of the most remote settlements in the Alps\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\u00d6sterreich literally means \"the Eastern Realm\" or \"Eastern Empire\" in German. \n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Holy Roman Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire\n\nToday's Austria is what was once the German-speaking core and centre of power for the large multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire with its imperial capital in Vienna. This empire stretched eastwards from present-day Austria through much of east-central and south-central Europe. It included the entire territories of modern-day Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and portions of Serbia, Romania, Ukraine, Poland and Italy, and also had a small colonial possession in Tianjin, China. While Prussia united the German states to the north into one \"German Empire\" in 1867-1871, Austria remained oriented eastwards towards its diverse empire. However, from the start of the 20th century, the political history of Austria has been closely linked to the misfortunes and disasters of modern German history, mainly the First and Second World Wars and their terrible aftermath.\nThe modern republic of Austria came into being in 1918 as a result of its defeat in World War I. In its wake, the empire was split into many components. They included Austria's current borders, an independent Hungary, lands given to Italy (South Tyrol, Trieste and Trentino), lands given to southern Poland (which also came about from lands taken from the Russian and German Empires, lands which those three empires had taken from Poland in the three \"divisions\" that erased Poland from the map for over a century), an independent Czechoslovakia and the northern and western half of Yugoslavia. Interwar Austria was an unstable state with pro-German fascists, pro-independence clerical reactionaries and left wing social democrats fighting over control, sometimes violently and ultimately descending into the \"Austro-Fascist\" dictatorship of the 1930s. Following an unresisted invasion and annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, Austria more or less functioned as a part of Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Most of the population supported Hitler (who was himself born in Austria) and Austria's incorporation into Germany, and Austrian soldiers also fought in the Wehrmacht. Cities were bombed heavily by the Allies and concentration camps where the Holocaust was perpetrated also existed on Austrian soil (such as Mauthausen near Linz).\nIt was not until the end of the war that the mood changed and that Austria tried to distance itself from Germany. In 1945, Austria was divided into zones of occupation like Germany. However, unlike Germany, Austria was not subject to any further territorial losses. A treaty signed in 1955 ended the Allied and Soviet occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade future unification with Germany. A constitutional law of that same year declared the country's \"perpetual neutrality\", a condition for Soviet military withdrawal, and thus saved Austria from Germany's fate as a divided nation with a divided capital. However, the South Tyrol Question (South Tyrol had been part of Austria Hungary before World War I and the German speaking inhabitants felt alienated by the Italian government) took Austria and Italy to the UN in the post-war era and international brokered mitigation found a suitable solution for both countries by the late 1980s. This official neutrality, once ingrained as part of the Austrian cultural identity, has been called into question since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995.\nIt took quite a long time after the war for re-examining Austria's Nazi past to become large-scale and accepted as commonplace in the media. After the war, Austria had sought to portray itself as \"Hitler's first victim\", although Hitler himself was Austrian. This blatant denial of historical fact is now called \"the original lie of the Second Republic\" by many leftists. A high-profile case of Austria's denial of its past came to the fore when Austrian president and former UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim was embroiled in a scandal in the early 1990s due to having been a member of the SA during the war. To this day, Austria has a harder time being frank about its Nazi past than Germany and far-right Burschenschaften still play an important role in the politics of FP\u00d6 and to some extent \u00d6VP leading to occasional scandals.\nPost-1945 Austrian politics were dominated by \"grand coalitions\" between the \"red\" centre-left SP\u00d6 and the \"black\" centre-right \u00d6VP. This meant that important posts in government and the civil service were shared out according to Proporz (~proportionality) among \"red\" and \"black\". Whatever the faults of this system, it helped prevent the extremely violent and unstable politics Austria had had to endure in the interwar era when \"reds\" and \"blacks\" were pitted against each other in open hostility. With the 1999 coalition between the \u00d6VP and the far-right FP\u00d6, this consensus-oriented way of making politics started to crumble, and Austrian politics has since become a lot more like the politics of other European countries.\nA prosperous country, Austria entered the European Monetary Union in 1999, and the euro currency replaced the schilling in 2002. Austria is also part of \"borderless Europe\", resulting in many students from all over the European Union studying in Austrian universities and vice versa. As the rules for entry to Austrian universities are different from those in Germany, many German students of subjects such as medicine have gone to Austria to study in the last couple of decades. This may from time to time cause friction, but this is mostly tongue-in-cheek and not all that serious.\nAustria is one of the most popular summer and winter holiday destinations in Europe and has the tourist industry to match it.\n\n\nCulture\n\nAustria is a federation. Each of its nine federal states has a unique and distinct culture.\nAustrians aren't easy to categorize. In fact, the main reason Austrians stand out from their European neighbors is that they don't stand out from the rest for anything in particular. Austrians are moderate in their outlook and behavior. Being at Europe's crossroads, their culture is influenced from several sides. The stereotype of the yodelling, thigh slapping, beer-swilling (schnitzel-eating) xenophobe may apply to a few individuals but it certainly doesn't apply to the majority of Austrians.\nThe average Austrian on the street is likely to be friendly yet somewhat reserved and formal, softly spoken and well mannered, law abiding, socially conservative, rooted, family-oriented, conformist and somewhat nepotistic, a Roman Catholic at heart, not particularly religious but a follower of tradition, well educated if not as cosmopolitan as his/her other European cousins, cynical, and equipped with a dry, sarcastic sense of humor.\nAustrians generally like to define themselves merely by what they are not. Tourists often make the mistake of classifying Austrians as Germans, which despite a common language (well at least on paper), they are not. Arguably, Southern Germany, especially Bavaria, is a close cultural relative of Austria in many ways. Indeed, the regions of Austria are all similar to their neighbors, so you will not notice you have crossed a border, whether it be into South Tyrol in Italy, north to Bavaria or east to Hungary.\nAustria and Germany are sister nations and enjoy warm relations, but Mozart was Austrian, or a Salzburger for the record, not German! For most of its history, Austrians have a hard time defining their own nation; they face perhaps the most media influence from Germany but have a very different culture, especially from northern Germany. The historic minorities and individual cultures are valued, yet they have to struggle to survive. An important minority are the Carinthian Slovenes, who surprisingly voted to stay part of Austria (rather than become part of the newly formed Yugoslav state) after World War I. While this \"heroic\" act of \"national self-preservation\" was much mytholygised in the past, J\u00f6rg Haider of the far-right FP\u00d6 got his start in politics in Carinthia by catering to SS veterans and calling into question the right of Carinthian Slovenes to have bilingual town signs in places where they form a significant part of the population - an issue that is controversial to this day as vandalised street signs show.\nAustria has a long history of being a multicultural country: a glance at the Vienna phone book is all you need to discover this. Ironically, it is Germany to the north that is paving the way regarding the integration of foreigners into society in Central Europe. Austria remains a largely conservative and rural country with the exception of Vienna. Indeed, the cultural conflicts and national identity are as complicated and hard to understand for many Austrians as they are for visitors! The level of personal awareness and views on this vary greatly from person to person but are generally subject to a particularly Austrian avoidance of the subject. It is best to try to see the diversity and enjoy the variety than to jump to conclusions.\nHence many Austrians derive their identity from their region or Bundesland (state). For instance, typical inhabitants of Carinthia would say that they are Carinthian first and Austrian second and maybe European third. Asking what state someone is from is normally the first question Austrians ask when meeting for the first time.\nThe fact that Austrians dislike demonstrations of national identity can, however, also be explained partly by the historical experiences Austria had during the Third Reich and especially due to the violent use of national symbols in the growing Austrofascist movement and by the far-right Freedom Party. It is also because the current state of Austria is a relatively young and loose federal republic of just 8 million people.\nHowever, the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center rates Austria as the 5th most patriotic country in the world. So Austrians do very much love their country but are unlikely to be flag-wavers. Perhaps Austria's ascendancy to the EU in 1995 and its adoption of the euro and the border-less Europe have given it a stronger sense of importance and self-worth in the greater context of Europe.\nMost Austrians like to enjoy the good life. They spend a lot of time eating, drinking and having a good time with friends in a cozy environment, and are therefore very hospitable. Members of the older generation can be conservative in the sense that they frown upon extremes of any shape and form and, in general, are adverse to change. They enjoy one of the highest living standards in the world and want to keep it that way.\nAustria has no well-defined class system. The rural and regional difference tend to be greater than in neighboring countries. Generally, the further to the west and the more rural you go, the more socially conservative people are.\n\n\nPolitics\nAustria is a parliamentary federal republic consisting of nine federal states (see list below). The head of the state is the federal president (Bundespr\u00e4sident), who is elected directly by the people for a term of six years. His/her function is mainly representative, however, and the federal chancellor (Bundeskanzler), elected by a majority of the lower chamber of the parliament, runs most of the day-to-day politics.\nThe Austrian parliament consists of two chambers, the Nationalrat (National Council) as the main chamber, and the Bundesrat (Federal Council). The members of the National Council are elected every five years by popular vote, and the members of the Federal Council are elected by each of the state parliaments for 4- to 6-year terms. The composition of the Bundesrat changes after every election to a state's parliament.\nThere are three major parties in Austria: the Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6), the (conservative) Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP), and the (right-wing) Freedom Party (FP\u00d6). Historically, SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP were the two dominant forces in Austrian politics. Between the re-emergence of the Austrian Republic after World War II and the late 1980s each party usually got between 40% and 50% of the votes and governed either alone or together in 'grand coalitions' (interrupted only by a brief SP\u00d6-FP\u00d6 coalition between 1983 and 1987). During that time they also divided up practically all positions of influence in Austria between them (Proporz). From 1990 onwards, this system began to crumble due to people's dissatisfaction with 'politics as usual' and the rise of the FP\u00d6 under its leader J\u00f6rg Haider who introduced a new brand of anti-foreigner populism to Austrian politics. After the 1999 elections in which both SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP did dismally and the FP\u00d6 reached second place, a new coalition was formed between \u00d6VP and FP\u00d6. As the then first and only government to include right-wing populists in the European Union, the new Austrian leadership was shunned by the heads of government of the other fourteen EU member states. In the following elections the FP\u00d6 did badly due to internal squabbles and the fact that the reality of government could not live up to its promises. Between 2006 and 2017 Austria was again governed by a series of SP\u00d6-\u00d6VP coalitions.\nAfter elections in 2017, the \u00d6VP under its new leader, former foreign minister Sebastian Kurz, formed a coalition with the FP\u00d6. Both parties had increased their share of the vote, promising a tougher stance on migration and supposed 'islamisation' following an influx of refugees and migrants into Austria in 2015. A corruption scandal in the FP\u00d6 led to the early breakdown of the coalition and snap elections in 2019, after which Chancellor Kurz formed a coalition with the Greens.\n\n\nGeography\n\nContrary to popular perceptions, Austria is not all about mountains. While the Alps do cover 3/4 of the country dominating the provinces of Vorarlberg, Tyrol, Salzburg, Styria, Upper Austria and Carinthia, the eastern provinces of Lower Austria, the Burgenland and the federal capital of Vienna are more similar to the geography of the neighboring Czech Republic and Hungary. This diverse mix of landscapes is packed into a relatively small area of size. Glaciers, meadows, alpine valleys, wooded foothills, gently rolling farmland, vineyards, river gorges, plains and even semi-arid steppes can be found in Austria.\nOne quarter of Austria's population lives in Greater Vienna, a European metropolis, located where the Danube meets the easternmost fringe of the Alps, not far from the border with Slovakia and its capital Bratislava.\nVirtually all government, financial and cultural institutions, as well as national media and large corporations are based in Vienna, due largely to history and geography. Thus, the capital dominates Austria's cultural and political life and is clearly a world unto its own. It has little to do with the rest of mainly rural Austria and outside of Graz and Linz there really are no other large scale cities in the country. There is a playful joke told in Vorarlberg province regarding the dominance of Vienna regarding national affairs that reads, \"the people of western Austria make the money and Vienna spends it.\"\n\n\nClimate\nAustria has a temperate continental climate. Summers last from early June to mid-September and\ncan be hot in some years and rainy in others. Day-time temperatures in July and August are around 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F), but can often reach 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F). Winters are cold in the lowlands and very harsh in the Alpine region with temperatures often dropping below -10\u00b0C (14\u00b0F). Winters last from December to March (longer at higher altitudes). In the Alpine region large temperature fluctuations occur all year round and nights are chilly even in high summer. The northern Alps are generally a lot wetter than the rest of the country. The South East (Styria and Carinthia) is dry and sunny. The area around Vienna often experiences strong easterly winds.\n\n\nElectricity\nElectricity is supplied at 220 to 230 V 50 Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\" or the compatible, but non-grounded, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types. Generally speaking, U.S. and Canadian travellers should pack an adapter and a converter for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Austria.\n\n\nTourist information\n Tourist information website. (updated Feb 2024)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nVisa\n\nAustria is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\nOne of the best ways to stay in the country for longer than 90 days is to study on a study visa, for example by studying on a TEFL course.\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are six airports in Austria with scheduled flights. The most important international airport is Vienna airport (VIE IATA) which has connection to most major airports of the world. In the neighbouring town of Schwechat, it's the hub of Austrian Airlines, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lufthansa. There are smaller international airports in Graz, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt, Linz, and Salzburg which mainly offer connections to European destinations. \nFor traveling to Western Austria it may make sense to fly into Munich airport (MUC IATA) and Memmingen (FMM IATA). While Bratislava (BTS IATA) does not have nearly as many connections as Munich or Vienna, it is only about 70 kilometers from Vienna and there is a direct bus service. The most common airports to visit Vorarlberg are Altenrhein (ACH IATA) via Austrian, Friedrichshafen (FDH IATA) and Z\u00fcrich (ZRH IATA).\nIf visiting Austria for winter sports, choose the airport considering cost and duration for the whole trip (plane and transfer). Vienna is a 4-hour drive from the nearest medium-sized ski resort. See more in the Get In section of Winter sports in Austria.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe bus is not always the cheapest way to travel, though impressive discounts for advanced bookings exist for long-distance travel (as far as from Warsaw for \u20ac1). The bus may also be the cheapest option if you want to travel at short notice or if you have large amounts of luggage. Bus travel is especially interesting for those coming from the East as there are many buses into Vienna and they are often faster than trains. Information about their assorted services and pricing is can be found in that section. Most of the companies that run Intercity buses in Germany also serve major Austrian cities.\nFlixbus, the biggest fish in the German Intercity Bus pond and now a major player in most of Europe serves a couple of international routes through and into Austria.\n\n\nBy car\n\nAustria and all its neighbouring countries are Schengen members so in theory there are no border controls. For using the Autobahnen or Schnellstra\u00dfen, a vignette, or tax sticker, must be purchased and displayed on the wind-shield. Costs are \u20ac86.40 for one year, \u20ac25.90 for 2 months, or \u20ac8.90 for 10 days and can be purchased at most service stations before the border and at the border. Some major tunnels have an additional toll of between \u20ac4 and \u20ac10.\nOn some Saturdays in July and August expect traffic jams on the motorways between Germany, Austria and Italy when millions of German tourists head south at the beginning of school vacations. A delay of about 2 hours is not unusual. The motorway A10 between Salzburg and Villach is especially notorious. It's best to avoid those Saturdays.\n\n\nFrom Germany\nMotorway A8 from Munich to Salzburg.\nMotorway A93 from Rosenheim via Kufstein to Innsbruck, Tyrol.\nE43 (A96) from Leutkirch via Wangen to Bregenz, Vorarlberg.\nMotorway A3/E56 from Regensburg via Passau to Linz, Upper Austria.\n\n\nFrom Italy\nMotorway A23 to Villach, Carinthia.\nE45 via Brenner to Innsbruck, Tyrol.\nConsidering the overall limited distances, for most Italians residing in the north, an excellent solution is to reach Austria by car. From Bolzano, Innsbruck is only an hour and a half away, while it takes about 3 hours to reach Salzburg from both Bolzano and Udine. Vienna, on the other hand, is a little further away, considering about 5 and a half hours from Bolzano, 6 hours from Venice and 8 from Milan.\nSome of the Italy-Austria border crossings are famous for cycling enthusiasts and high mountain lovers, such as the Resia pass, the Rombo pass and the Vizze pass, while the borders between Friuli and the Austrian region of Carinthia are less traveled: they are the Monte Croce Carnico pass, the Pramollo pass and the Coccau pass, near Tarvisio, where the A23 motorway ends. In detail, the active crossings throughout the year between Italy and Austria are: Brenner Pass, along the A22 motorway (or the state road 12), connecting Bolzano to Innsbruck; Passo Resia, starting from Merano, leads to the border between Austria and Switzerland along state roads 38 and 40; Passo del Tarvisio, along the A23 motorway and once in Austria the A2, connects Udine to Villach; Passo di San Candido which connects Dobbiaco to Lienz via the state road 49; Passo di Monte Croce Carnico, along the SS 52bis it connects Tolmezzo with Mauthen; Passo di Pramollo, reachable by exiting the A23 in Pontebba. There are also two seasonal passes, usually closed from November to May, namely: Passo Stalle connects the Anterselva valley with the Defereggental in East Tyrol; the Passo del Rombo, north of Merano, along the provincial road 44bis.\n\n\nFrom Slovenia\nE61 from Ljubljana to Villach, Carinthia (via Karawankentunnel).\nE57 from Maribor to Graz, Styria.\n\n\nFrom Hungary\nMotorway M1 (E60) from Budapest to Vienna (Hegyeshalom-Nickelsdorf Border Crossing)\n\n\nFrom Slovakia\nMotorway D4 (E58) from Bratislava to Vienna (Jarovce-Kittsee Border Crossing)\n\n\nBy train\nSee also rail travel in Europe\nAustria has plenty of connections with all its neighbours daily. Every neighbouring country (even Liechtenstein) has trains to and from Austria at least hourly. Many (Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Slovakia, Switzerland) even more frequently. Vienna is the largest railway hub, but day and night trains from most Central European countries travel to many stops across Austria. \nThe \u00d6BB (Austrian Railways) operate high-speed ICE and RailJet trains in cooperation with railways of neighbouring countries like Deutsche Bahn or \u010ceske Dr\u00e1hy from cities like Z\u00fcrich, Munich, Frankfurt, Passau, Prague and Budapest. Vienna has a direct Railjet connection from Venice and from Brussels via Cologne and Frankfurt airport.\nEurocity trains are the next fastest trains available, comparable to the Intercity trains connecting the bigger Austrian cities. Regional trains called EURegio and Regionalzug are also available from all of Austria's neighbours.\nAfter Germany withdrew their night train brand at the end of 2016, Austria took up the mantle of European sleeper trains and now cover most neighbouring countries (and even some far-off points) at competitive rates under their Nightjet brand. Unique among European railways, \u00d6BB is acquiring new, more modern rolling stock to expand its night train service. While these are much slower than day trains, they can save you a hotel night and the daytime hours of the alternative.\nTrain tickets can be purchased from certain locations to Austria via the \u00d6BB website. Always compare fares from the departure or even transit countries' railways as there may be price difference even for the same train. \u00d6BB offers discount 'SparSchiene' tickets to and from destinations like Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Serbia, and Switzerland for a flat-rate (i.e. \u20ac29 for a one-way seater, \u20ac39 for a couchette, or \u20ac59 for a sleeper). There are a limited number of tickets at this price. At peak times you need to book in advance. Additional offers are available to all countries in Central Europe, although many cannot be booked online.\n\n\nFrom Slovakia\nThere's a pontoon bridge accessible only to pedestrians and cyclists just south of the Austrian-Czech-Slovak three-country border, between Hohenau an der March (Austria) and Moravsk\u00fd Sv\u00e4t\u00fd J\u00e1n (Slovakia). The way goes through flat countryside, is very calm and can be conveniently done by bike. Its length is approximately 6 km, of which the 4 km on the Slovak part are a completely straight invariable landscape which may feel somewhat boring.\nThe urban traffic company of Bratislava (DPB) runs a cross-border bus line no. 901 between Hainburg an der Donau (Austria) and Bratislava (Slovakia), with a stop also in the Austrian town of Wolfsthal. In Bratislava, the terminus is the stop Nov\u00fd most.\nThere's a pontoon ferry accessible to car-drivers and pedestrians between Angern an der March (Austria) and Z\u00e1horsk\u00e1 Ves (Slovakia). Open 05:00-22:00.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy train and bus\n\nMain article: Rail travel in Austria\nTrains are the best and most common form of mass transportation in Austria. Comfortable and moderately priced trains connect major cities and many towns; buses serve less significant towns and lakes. The two forms of transport are integrated and designed to complement each other, and intercity coaches exist but don't provide anywhere near the level of intercity rail service. Between Vienna, Linz, and Salzburg trains run every 30 minutes or even more frequently. Trains between Vienna and Graz operate hourly. The 2\u00bd-hour train ride takes you along one of the world's oldest mountain railways. 14 tunnels and 16 viaducts were built to cross the Alps.\nAustrian trains are operated mostly by state-owned company \u00d6BB. The Raaberbahn (GySEV) provides some trains across the Austrian-Hungarian border and there are some short private railways with tourist trains which supplement rather than compete with the \u00d6BB. The only competitor to \u00d6BB is WestBahn on the Salzburg-Linz-Vienna line. Westbahn serves several inner-city stations in Vienna that are otherwise only served by commuter trains, giving travelers more flexibility. \n\u00d6BB also operate buses (InterCityBus) on the Graz\u2013Klagenfurt\u2013Venice line because the road between these cities is much shorter than the railway.\nSeveral bus companies operate long-distance services in Austria. The major operators include FlixBus, Eurolines, \u00d6BB Postbus, Blaguss, and Westbus. FlixBus is the largest and most popular provider, offering a wide network of routes across the country and beyond.\n\n\nTickets\n\nThe \u00d6BB sell domestic tickets using a price based only upon distance traveled, regardless of when you buy the ticket and which train you take. Base fare is rather expensive, but Austrian Railways offer some interesting discounts. \nTickets can be ordered (and paid for) on the web, including narrow-gauge, privately operated railways. Tickets ordered online should be printed and presented to the conductor onboard upon request. They should be printed since they will be  barcode-scanned and stamped. There are ticket machines at all sizable train stations and onboard some regional trains. When boarding regional trains you are required to have purchased a ticket before boarding, if it is possible to buy a ticket via railway office or vending machine at the station you are departing from. Rail passes and \u00d6BB tickets are not valid on WestBahn; buy tickets on-line or on board.\n\n\nBy car\n\nMain article: Driving in Austria\nRural or sparsely populated regions in Austria are easier to explore by car as bus services can be infrequent. Many popular spots in the mountains are accessible only by car or on foot/ski. Renting a car for a couple of days is a good way to go off the beaten track. Driving in Austria is normally quite pleasant as the country is small and the roads are in good condition, not congested and offer fantastic scenery. \nTravelling on Austrian motorways (Autobahnen) or Schnellstra\u00dfen means you have to pay tolls. You have to buy a Vignette toll pass at any petrol station or at the border. Vignetten can be bought for 10 days or more. Vehicles heavier than 3500 kg must instead purchase a GO-Box, a transponder which deducts tolls. Additional tolls are payable on certain roads, especially mountain passes, which you need to pay in bank notes (not coins) or with credit card. \nThe speed limits are 130 km/h (81 mph) on Autobahnen and 100 km/h (62 mph) on Schnellstra\u00dfen and Bundesstra\u00dfen. Expect limits otherwise of 50\u201380 km/h (31\u201350 mph). Headlights should be switched on at all times.\nTake special care when driving in winter, especially in the mountains (winter lasts from September to May in the higher parts of the Alps and snowfall is in general possible at any time of the year). Icy roads kill dozens of inexperienced drivers every year. Winter tires are mandatory between November 1 and April 15. During winter season most rental cars are equipped with winter tyres, an additional fee may be charged.\n\n\nBy plane\nAlthough you'll miss out most of the stunning Austrian Landscape, it is possible to travel by plane within Austria.\nDomestic flights normally cost in the region of \u20ac300-500 return, Austrian Airlines offers limited tickets for \u20ac99 (Redtickets) but they have to be booked usually 2\u20133 months in advance. Since the country is small, the total journey time is unlikely to be shorter than by rail or car. As a matter of fact, even Austrian Airlines now codeshares with \u00d6BB for some \"feeder flights\". In other words, fly only if you are on a business trip.\nThese domestic airports are served by airlines like Austrian Airlines (AUA):\n\nGraz (Thalerhof), servicing eastern Styria and southern Burgenland\nInnsbruck (Kranebitten), servicing Tyrol\nKlagenfurt (W\u00f6rthersee-Airport), servicing Carinthia\nLinz (H\u00f6rsching), servicing Upper Austria\nSalzburg (Wals), servicing Salzburg and Berchtesgaden (Bavaria)\nVienna (Schwechat), servicing Vienna and Lower Austria\nHere are international airports serving western Austria:\n\nAltenrhein Airport (Switzerland), servicing Vorarlberg, Liechtenstein, Eastern Switzerland, and Lake Constance area\nFriedrichshafen (Germany), servicing Vorarlberg, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Lake Constance area\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nThe most popular ride-hailing services in Austria are Uber, Bolt and Free Now . (updated May 2024)\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: German phrasebook\nThe national official language of Austria is German which, in its national standard variety, known as Austrian (Standard) German (\u00d6sterreichisches (Hoch)deutsch) is generally identical to the German used in Germany, with some significant vocabulary differences, many of which concern kitchen language or the home, and a rather distinct accent. Most Austriacisms are loanwords from Austro-Bavarian, even though languages of the neighbouring countries have influenced as well. Other languages have some official status in different localities (e.g., Slovenian in Carinthia, Burgenland Croatian and Hungarian in Burgenland).\nSome examples for different vocabulary in Austrian German:\n\nThe first language of almost all Austrians, however, is not Standard German, but instead local dialects of Austro-Bavarian German (Boarisch), which is also spoken as a first language by many in Bavaria, Germany and South Tyrol, Italy.  However, in Vorarlberg it is replaced by Alemannic (Alemannisch), which is very close to Swiss German. Both these dialects belong to the Upper German family, but in extreme cases are only partially mutually intelligible to each other and Standard German, and especially in the larger cities almost everyone will be able to communicate in Standard German as well, if only when speaking to foreigners, (including Northern Germans). Most Austrians can understand another region's dialect but have the hardest time in Vorarlberg because it's Alemannic-speaking.\nEnglish is widely spoken, and the only area most tourists have linguistic problems with is in translating menus. In rural places, however, older people sometimes don't speak English, so it can help to learn a few basic German phrases if travelling to such places.\nItalian is widespread in the parts of Austria bordering Italy like Tyrol, even though the majority language on the Italian side (except in Bolzano, the region's capital) is still German (Austro-Bavarian in practice).\nAs a result of post-World War II immigration to Austria, in the large cities you will certainly encounter native speakers of Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian and Turkish.\nIn general, when speaking German, Austrians tend to pronounce the vowels longer and use a pronunciation which is regional, yet genuine, elegant and melodic; and some even regard it as the beautiful form of German. Also, the \"ch\", \"h\" and \"r\" are not as harshly pronounced as in Germany, making the accent much more mild in nature.\n\n\nSee\n\nWhile Austria may be in the very heart of Europe, the country has plenty of attractions to see. There are scenic backdrops, traditional music, visual architectural styles and an ethnically homogenous culture in its range. \nSummer and winter, large flocks of tourists are drawn to Austria's mighty mountainous scenery. With no less than 62% of the country at an altitude of 500m or more, it's hard to miss the stunning snow-covered peaks and green valleys. Depending on the season, you'll find green mountain meadows or white landscapes as far as you can see, but either way, you won't be disappointed by the grand views. Highlights include for example the High Mountain National Park in the Zimmertal Alps, with peaks up to 3476m, narrow gorges and steep cliffs. National Park Thayatal combines beautiful valley landscapes with a variety of castles and ruined fortresses. The country's highest peak is called Grossglockner and is located on the border between Carinthia and East Tyrol. To get a good view, the Grossglockner High Alpine Road, with its gorgeous panorama's comes highly recommended. At the feet of mountain peaks you'll find luscious valleys, including the lovely Villgratental. The river Danube created some beautiful valley landscapes, where you'll now find famous vineyards. Wachau and Dunkelsteinerwald in Lower Austria are fine (and protected) examples. To make the image complete, the valley landscapes and hillsides are dotted with countless picturesque villages.\n\nBesides all that rustic, tranquil nature and countryside, Austria has a whole other side too. As one of Europe's former great powers, Austria boasts a wealth of majestic architecture and historic structures. As it was long a centre of power in the Holy Roman Empire, you'll find not only palaces and magnificent city architecture but also grand cathedrals, monasteries and churches. Vienna, the country's capital and most popular destination, is packed with Medieval and Baroque structures. Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace with its 1441 rooms is the absolute highlight, and every little girls' princess dream. Its zoo, Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn, is the oldest in the world. The 12th century St. Stephen's Cathedral is the most prominent religious building. The same goes for Innsbruck, at the heart of Tyrol. The Mariazell Basilica in Mariazell is one of the country's most visited attractions and an important pilgrimage destination. Similar to Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace is Schloss Esterh\u00e1zy in Eisenstadt, which is situated in the most eastern province. It's said to be one of Austria's most beautiful baroque castles. Neusiedler See, a national park, is also worth seeing in this region.\nSalzburg was the birthplace of Mozart, and combines delightful Alpine surroundings with a beautifully preserved historic centre. It was also the home of the Trapp Family singing group, which inspired the 1956 film Trapp-Familie, and the 1965 musical film The Sound of Music. The latter one introduced the English-speaking world to the Austrian Alps, but was poorly received in Austria itself.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nSkiing and snowboarding\nSee also: Winter sports in Austria\nAustria is a traditional destination for downhill snowsports, as well as other winter sports.\n\n\nCycle touring\nSee also: Cycling in Europe\nAustria is well known for its scenic cycle routes along its largest rivers. Though Austria is a mountainous country, cycle routes along rivers are flat or gently downhill, and therefore suitable even for casual cyclists. The most famous route is the Danube cycle path from Passau to Vienna, one of the most popular cycle paths in Europe, drawing large crowds of cyclists from all over the world each summer. Other rivers with well-developed cycle routes are the Inn, Drau, Moell and Mur. Most routes follow a combination of dedicated cycle paths, country lanes, and traffic calmed roads, and are well suited for children.\n\n\nMusic\nSee also: European classical music\n\nMany visitors come to experience Austria's musical heritage. Salzburg and Vienna offer world renowned opera, classical music and jazz at moderate prices, but performances of high standards are also widely available throughout the rest of the country. There are dozens of Summer festivals for all tastes, the most famous being the avant-garde Salzburg festival (Salzburger Festspiele) but because they're aimed at tourists prices can be high. Austria's strong musical tradition is not confined to classical music alone. Austrian folk music (Volksmusik) is an integral part of rural Austria, and is said to have influenced many of the nation's big composers. In the Alps almost every village has its own choir or brass band (Blasmusik), and you'll often see groups of friends sitting down to sing Lieder in rural pubs. Traditional Alpine instruments are the accordion and zither. In Vienna a type of melancholic violin music known as Schrammelmusik is often performed in Restaurants and Heurigen.\n\n\nMovies\nAustria has quite a special kind of cinematic culture, that is worth taking notice of as a tourist. Many films star celebrities from cabaret, a kind of staged comedy popular in Austria. Most of these movies are characterized by their rather cynical and sometimes bizarre black humour, usually portraying members of Vienna's lower or middle class. Josef Hader, Roland D\u00fcringer, Reinhard Nowak or Alfred Dorfer are among the most outstanding actors here. Recommendations include Indien (1993), Muttertag (1993), Hinterholz 8 (1998), Komm, s\u00fc\u00dfer Tod (2000) and Silentium (2004). Popular directors are Harald Sicheritz, Michael Haneke and Ulrich Seidl. Haneke received positive international praise for his films Die Klavierspielerin (2001), based on the novel by nobel-prize winning author Elfriede Jelinek and Cach\u00e9 (2005). Seidl received various awards for his drama Hundstage (2001).\nAlso, the 1949 classic The Third Man was shot in Vienna, and is regularly shown in Vienna's Burg Kino.\n\n\nHiking\nIt is normally safe to hike without a guide in the Austrian Alps, as there is a dense network of marked trails and mountain shelters. However, a few lethal incidents do happen every year as a result of carelessness. Walkers are strongly advised not to stray off the trails and not to hike in bad weather or without suitable equipment. Before setting off, always check with the local tourist office whether the trail corresponds to your abilities.\nAlso, check the weather forecast. Sudden thunderstorms are frequent and are more likely to happen in the afternoon. A rule of thumb is that if you haven't reached the summit by noon, it's time to give up and return to shelter.\nThough the scenery is by all accounts majestic, don't expect an empty wilderness. The Alps can be very crowded with mountaineers, especially in high season (there are even traffic jams of climbers on some popular mountains). Littering is a no-no in all of Austria, but especially in the mountains, and you will enrage fellow walkers if you're seen doing it. If you really want to show respect, pick up any litter you happen to see in your path and dispose of it at the end of your hike (it's a bit of an unwritten rule). Long-distance trails are marked with the Austrian flag (red-white-red horizontal stripes) painted onto rocks and tree trunks.\nMost trails and mountain huts are maintained by the Austrian Alpine Club. Some are run by other equivalent organizations, such as the German, Dutch and Italian Alpine Clubs. Mountain huts are meant to be shelters, not hotels. Though they are normally clean and well-equipped, standards of food and accommodation are basic. Don't expect a high level of customer service either. Blankets are provided, but bringing a thin sleeping bag is mandatory for hygienic reasons. During the high season (August), it's a good idea to book in advance. Mountain huts will not turn anyone down for the night, but if they're full, you'll have to sleep on the floor. Prices for the night are usually around \u20ac10-20 (half for Alpine Club members), but meals and drinks are quite expensive, as everything has to be carried up from the valley, often by helicopters or on foot. For the same reason, there are no trash cans in or near huts. Electricity and gas are hard to bring there, too, so warm showers (if available at all) have to be paid for. Some huts don't even have running water, this means pit latrines. As mentioned above, mountain huts are very useful for hikers, they mostly have a heated common room and they are very romantic, but there is nothing more than necessary.\nDetailed hiking maps showing the location of marked trails and shelters can be purchased online from the Austrian Alpine Society.\n\n\nLakes\nAustria has many lakes. Normally they are very clean, so you can swim in them. In winter you can use them for ice skating. Some times you have to pay a fee to get on the lakeside. You can often find much information on the internet. Normally the place is very clean and often there is a camping place nearby. It's good to take your own towel with you. Near the grass fields you can often find a little shop, which sells different kinds of snacks, ice cream and drinks. At bigger lakes you can also find the Wasserrettung (safety in the water). They can help you in case of emergency or other problems. Lakes are a great way to spend your leisure time. Austrians normally spend the whole day at the place.\nSome popular lakes are the W\u00f6rthersee, Wolfgangsee, Attersee and the Neusiedler See.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nAustria uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\nAustria is a cash-oriented society, and while acceptance of credit/debit cards is on the rise, many shops are still cash only.\nThe best rates for changing money are offered by banks. Some banks will only exchange money for their account holders, and they usually add an exchange fee ranging from \u20ac3 to \u20ac6, or more when changing large amounts. Withdrawing money from the ubiquitous ATMs is also a viable option, especially if large amounts of cash are needed.\nThe Austrian schilling was replaced by the euro in 2002.  If you find any laying around, they can be exchanged at the Austrian Central Bank (\u00d6NB) indefinitely.\n\n\nPrices\nThe prices are comparable with Western European countries, and a bit higher than the USA. The general sales tax of 20% is included in prices but lower sales taxes applies to certain services and mainly food. A can of Coke in a supermarket will cost you about \u20ac1, a mid-range meal \u20ac20. Prices in tourist areas (Tyrol, Vienna, Salzburg, Zell am See) can be higher than the averages. B&B accommodation and restaurants in towns and rural areas are comparatively cheap.\n\n\nShops\n\nShops are generally open from 08:00 to 19:00 on weekdays and Saturday from 08:00 to 18:00 and closed on Sundays except for gas station shops (expensive), shops in railway stations and restaurants. Especially in rural areas smaller shops may close around noon on Saturdays. Some also may be closed between 12:00 and 15:00 on weekdays. Paying by credit card is not common like in the rest of Europe or United States and Canada but all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club) are accepted at almost every gas station and at bigger shops, especially in shopping malls. In smaller towns and villages you normally find one or two small shops or bakeries, which carry nearly everything, called \"Grei\u00dfler\", although they are under threat from bigger shopping centers.\n\n\nATMs\nATMs in Austria are called Bankomat. They are widespread and you will find them even in smaller, rural villages. Many shops (and some restaurants too) offer the service to pay directly with an ATM card. The majority of ATMs accept cards from abroad. All Bankomats in Austria can easily identified by a sign showing a green stripe above a blue stripe. Usually no fees will be charged, but the company Euronet charges \u20ac1.90 per withdrawal.\n\n\nTipping\nIn Austria, tipping is common and, although legally not mandatory, often considered as socially obligatory. Giving 5% to 10% of the total amount is common; more signals exceptionally good service. Rounding to a multiple of a Euro is common, for low sums the amount paid is often a multiple of 50 cents (i.e. a bill of \u20ac7.80 can be paid as \u20ac8 or \u20ac8.50).\nTipping is not practised when the goods are exchanged over the counter (i.e. in fast-food restaurants or at street stalls). Traditionally, the owner of a restaurant does not receive a tip. A tip is known in the German language as Trinkgeld, which literally translates as 'money for drink'. It is also common practice to tip other service employees, like taxi drivers or hair dressers. Attempting to tip any kind of government employee may be perceived as a bribe and will get you in trouble.\n\n\nBargaining\nBargaining is not common throughout Austria except at flea markets. It may be okay to ask for a discount, but accept No as an answer.\n\n\nWhat gifts to take home\nEiswein (ice wine)\u2014see Drink section\nMarillenmarmelade (Apricot Jam)\nPumpkin Seed Oil a speciality from the southern region Styria\nManner Schnitten Popular sweets in pink package available almost everywhere.\nSalzburger Mozartkugeln chocolate balls with marzipan in the middle\n\n\nFor children\nHaba wooden toys\n\n\nEat\n\nAustrian food is distinctive and delicious, and is traditionally of the stodgy, hearty \"meat and dumplings\" variety. Wiener Schnitzel (a bread-crumbed and fried veal escalope) is something of a national dish, and Kn\u00f6del are a kind of dumpling which can be made either sweet or savory according to taste.\nIn Vienna the Tafelspitz (boiled beef with potatoes and horseradish - it's classier than it sounds) is traditionally served on Sundays, and is normally accompanied by clear broth with dumplings and herbs. Apart from these, Austria is renowned for its pastries and desserts, the most well-known of which is probably the Apfelstrudel.\nBread (Brot) is taken seriously in Austria. Almost every village has its own bakery, offering a large choice of freshly baked sweet and savoury rolls daily from 06:00. Rye bread (Vollkornbrot, Bauernbrot) is the traditional staple food among peasants. If this is too heavy for you, try the common white bread roll (Semmel). Somewhat surprisingly, it is easier to find good bread outside of Vienna, where the baking industry hasn't yet come to be dominated by industrial scale chain shops.\nSome Austrians have a habit of eating sweet flour-based dishes (Mehlspeise) for a main course once a week. Varieties include Kaiserschmarren, Marillenknoedel, and Germknoedel.\nThe best advice is to dive into the menu and give it a go - there are no nasty surprises!\n\n\nRestaurants\nIf you want to try out traditional Austrian food go for a Gasthaus or Gasthof, which serve traditional food for reasonable prices. Usually they offer various options of set lunch including a soup and a main dish and in some cases a dessert too. They are typically priced at \u20ac5-7 (except for very touristy areas). Menus are written in German, though some of the restaurants have English menus as well. Keep in mind that tipping is expected throughout all restaurants in Austria. Rounding up the price given on the bill is usually enough tip.\n\n\nPaying\nIn Austrian restaurants you must ask to pay. Get the attention of your server and say: \"zahlen, bitte\" (the bill, please). They will then bring you the check, or tell you the amount of the bill verbally. Then, the proper way to pay in Austria is to give your cash and say the amount you wish to pay, including tip. To tip it is appropriate to round up, or to round up +50 cents or \u20ac1 of the cost for each person (should equal about 5-10% for a full meal). Servers are not dependent on tips, and it is not appropriate to tip a large amount. Saying \"danke\" (thank you) when paying, means keep the change! Alternatively, you can say the amount of the bill plus your tip and you'll only get change above that amount (for instance, if you pay with a \u20ac20 bill, the amount is \u20ac16.50 and you say \"Siebzehn Euro\" (seventeen euro), the server will give you \u20ac3 change and keep the \u20ac0.50 as tip).\n\n\nLocal specialties\nIf you have the chance to try Kletzennudeln you should definitely do it. They are an exceptional Carinthian specialty you can very rarely get anywhere: sweet noodles filled with dried pears and soft cheese. The best Kletzennudeln are handmade with minced dried pears, rather than the lower quality versions which use pear powder.\nSalads can be made with Kern\u00f6l (green pumpkin seed oil), a Styrian specialty. Even though it looks frightening (dark green or dark red, depending on lighting conditions) it has an interesting nutty taste. A bottle of good, pure Styrian Kern\u00f6l is very expensive (around \u20ac10-20), but maybe one of the most Austrian things to take home. Beware of cheap Kern\u00f6l, sometimes sold as \"Salat\u00f6l\". Be sure to seal the bottle appropriately, the oil expands when slightly heated and leaves non removable stains. Just in case, sunlight occasionally removes them though. Kern\u00f6l or pumpkin seed oil is also available in some online shops.\n\n\nDesserts\n\nStrudel is a sweet layery, pastry filled with fruits, most commonly apples.\nSachertorte is chocolate torte with chocolate icing and filled with apricot jam. It should be served fresh with freshly beaten, lightly sweetened cream, which the Austrians call \"Schlagobers\". The original is available in Vienna in the Cafe Sacher, but similar cakes are very common in many other Viennese Cafes. Cafe Sacher has several tourist-trap behaviours (such as a non-optional \u20ac2 coat check) and their cakes are not always the freshest.\nEszterh\u00e1zy: Austrian torte.\nMalakhoff: a delicate cake made with milk and rum\nManner Schnitten are a very Viennese sweet specialty, but just the square form factor and pink packaging are really unique. You can buy them everywhere. (Maybe you've already seen these as a product placement in some Hollywood movies or for example in \"Friends\" and wondered what they are.)\nMilchrahmstrudel: milk and curd cheese strudel, served warm\nPowidl is a type of savoury prune jam with alcohol, another specialty from Vienna. It makes a good present as it tastes exotic and is hard to find anywhere else in the world.\n\n\nVegetarians\nVegetarianism is slowly gaining ground in Austria, especially in bigger cities. Austrians aren't as carnivorous as the rest of their Central European neighbors; 47% of the country reports having a diverse diet with only limited amounts of meat. Most restaurants don't cater for vegetarians specifically, but you're almost certain to find meals on the menu containing no meat. As an alternative, there are vegetarian restaurants in every major city, as well as harder to find vegan or vegan-friendly places. You can get vegetarian and vegan products (e.g. tofu, soy milk, lactose-free products) in nearly all supermarkets across the country (in rural areas as well) and in many health-food shops.\nIn more traditional or very rural restaurants, you may be viewed as eccentric if you say you are vegetarian, and it's possible that not a single meal on the menu is meat-free. This is especially true for restaurants serving traditional Austrian cuisine which relies heavily on meat\u2014even apparent vegetable dishes such as potato salad or vegetable soup often contain meat products. Sometimes, also food clearly labeled as \"vegetarian\" contains fish, as vegetarianism is often equated with pescetarianism. If unsure, ask the waiting staff if there are any animal products in the dish you're about to order. Some traditional meals that are guaranteed to be vegetarian are Kaiserschmarren (sweet pieces of fluffy pancake with fruit compote), Germkn\u00f6del (sweet dumpling with sour prune jam), and Kasnudel (similar to ravioli).\nAustria's Vegan Society maintains an updated list of vegetarian- and vegan-friendly eating places: original and translated version\n\n\nDrink\n\nVienna is famous for its caf\u00e9 culture, and there are coffee houses all over the city, many of which have outdoor terraces that are popular in the summer. Visit them for coffee (of course), hot chocolate and pastries. Most famous is Sacher-Torte.\nAustria also has some first class wines, mostly whites, slightly on the acidic side. Due to its climate, Austrian reds will often be made from grape varieties such as Zweigelt or Blaufr\u00e4nkisch which are not familiar to many wine drinkers from outside the country, but are definitely worth trying. Wine can be drunk mixed with mineral water, called \"G'spritzter\" or \"Spritzer\". The best place to do so is at the \"Heurigen\" in the suburban areas of Vienna. Originally the \"Heurigen\" were open only in summer, but now you can have your \"Spritzer\" throughout the year with a little self-served snack. Locally produced wine is often inexpensive - it's easy to find a perfectly passable bottle for less than \u20ac5 in a supermarket. Sturm, or young wine, similar to federwei\u00dfer in Germany, can be found in early autumn. It's cloudy in appearance, and while not as high in alcohol as normal wine, can be easy to overdo because it's fairly sweet and fizzy.\nSoft drinks: Austria has also a national soft drink called Almdudler. It is lemonade with herbs. North Americans will find it similar to, but not exactly like, ginger ale. Other typical Austrian soft drinks are Holler or Hollundersaft. It's a soft drink made of elderberry blossoms. The globally popular energy drink Red Bull is a license produced localisation of Krating Daeng from Thailand but is often seen as an Austrian invention and is sold everywhere.\nBeer in Austria is largely ubiquitous with M\u00e4rzen Lager. The quality is generally very good but varies greatly between breweries, as in many other Central European countries. The best options are from a modest number of remaining regional breweries not yet bought up by Heineken. Visitors accustomed to the selection common in most larger towns in the US or UK may be underwehlemed by beer lists, even in upscale bars. There are a small number of micro-breweries around the country, offering more exotic brews such as stouts. Beer culture in Austria is not widespread, many Austrians have strong brand loyalty but don't know the difference between pilsner and lager, so don't be surprised if a bartender or server struggles to answer your questions.\n\nLagers: decent classic \"M\u00e4rzen\" lagers commonly available include Stiegl, Egger and Zwettler. The quality of many others including G\u00f6sser, Puntigamer, Schwechater, Wieselburger and Zipfer all now under the Heinicken umbrella has debatebly dropped.\nPilsners: are normally noted with Pils or Spezial, most common is Hirter Pils.\nDunkles: is a rich dark brew offered by most breweries.\nWei\u00dfe: is wheat beer. There are several breweries and many imports from neighboring Bavaria, though its rarely found on tap.\nZwickl: is unfiltered lager and the pride of several breweries.\nSchnaps is a type of fruit brandy served in many parts of Austria, usually after a meal. The most popular flavours are pear, apricot, and raspberry, though dozens of other flavours are available.\nThere are three quality tiers of Schnaps: distilled, infused, and flavoured. The distilled variety is the highest quality; several brands of Austrian fruit Schnaps rank among the best in the world, but are accordingly expensive: a half-Liter bottle can cost up to \u20ac100.\n\"Real\" Schnaps is made from real fruit (either distilled or infused). Beware of the cheap stuff sold in large bottles in supermarkets; this is often of the \"flavoured\" type - nothing more than pure ethanol mixed with artificial flavouring. If you want the real thing, go to a deli or upscale bar (if you're in a bigger city) or a Buschenschank (Farmhouse) (if you're in the countryside). However, be careful with Schnaps especially if you are not used to alcoholic drinks!\nEiswein is a type of dessert wine produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine. Eiswein is generally quite expensive due to the labour-intense and risky production process. Your best bet is to buy eiswein at Naschmarkt for \u20ac10-15 for 375 ml or 500 ml; more chances to find it there on weekends. Just to give an idea of prices elsewhere, ice wine sells at Wein & Co near Naschmarkt at \u20ac24-30 for a 375 ml bottle, and Vienna duty-free shop sells it for \u20ac23.50 as well.\nStroh is possibly the best known Austrian spirit drink. It is classified as a kind of rum, although it's not produced of sugarcane molasses like the Caribbean \"real\" rum is. Coming in five versions (the strongest one having an alcohol content of 80%!), Stroh is often used as a component in cocktails like Jagertee and as a flavoring for cakes and pastries.\nOne of the best and widely available mineral waters is V\u00f6slauer which comes in a sparkling, light sparkling, and non-sparkling version (glass bottles served in restaurants, PET bottles can be purchased in supermarkets). Austrians often mix V\u00f6slauer sparkling mineral water with a variety of juices in a 50/50 proportion which is then qualified with the adjective gespritzt\n\n\nSleep\n\nAlthough hotels can usually even be found in smaller cities they are quite expensive (even more so in bigger cities) cheaper possibilities in big cities are youth hostels and in smaller towns you can often find families renting flats in bed and breakfast style (look for Pension or Zimmer Frei signs) for \u20ac15-25. In the countryside many farmers will rent out rooms for a couple of nights, both officially and unofficially. To find a place to stay, simply knock on the door of a farmhouse and ask - if they don't have a room they'll probably know someone nearby who does.\nYou can also find a lot of camping grounds (some of them are open the whole year round) but while they are exceptionally clean and often provide additional services, they are also a bit more expensive than in other countries in Central Europe.\nAustrian law requires anyone to register at their resident address, even if it's only for one night and even if it's a campsite.\nHotels will therefore ask you to hand over your passport or driving license and may refuse to give you accommodation if you don't have any ID on you. Don't worry too much about handing over your passport. In many countries, such a practice would raise concerns, but in Austria, it's a standard procedure. Your passport will be returned. If you stay in private accommodation for longer than about two weeks, you should obtain a document of registration (Meldezettel) from the local registration authority (Bezirksamt or Meldeamt), usually located in the town hall. This document needs to be signed by the owner or tenant of your accommodation. Failure to present this document upon departure could cause difficulties if you have stayed in the country for more than two or three months.\n\n\nLearn\nAustria has many great universities, the majority of which are located in Vienna, Graz, and Innsbruck. A development in tertiary education is the Fachhochschulen (Universities of Applied Sciences), vocational colleges that typically focus on engineering and business education with less emphasis on research than traditional universities, but a stronger view toward practice.\nIf you plan to study in Austria go here: [1] to see the requirements. If you need advice, you can contact the national students union at [2].\n\n\nWork\nCitizens of European Union member states or EFTA member states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Norway) may work in Austria without any restrictions. Everyone else, however, needs a work permit to work in Austria. \nWith an unemployment rate of 5%, finding a job in Austria should not be difficult for those with the right qualifications and skills. Bear in mind a lot of jobs in Austria require a good knowledge of German. Graduates of Austrian universities have an edge in the Austrian job market. \nQualified third country nationals (Non-EU and Non-EFTA citizens) may apply for a Red-White-Red Card, which enables someone to stay in Austria for two years and work at a specific company. \nThere is plenty of unskilled work available in the tourism industry. As long as you have a work permit, finding a job can often be as easy as simply turning up at a hotel and asking. Seasonal work in large ski\nresorts is the most promising option.\n\n\nStay safe\nAustria is one of the safest countries in the world. According to the OECD Factbook of 2006, levels of robbery, assault, and car crime are among the lowest in the developed world, and a study by Mercer ranks Vienna as the 6th safest city in the world out of 215 cities. Violent crimes are extremely rare and should not concern the average tourist. Small towns and uninhabited areas such as forests are very safe at any time of the day.\nBeware of pickpockets in crowded places. Like everywhere in Europe they are becoming increasingly professional. Bicycle theft is rampant in bigger cities, but virtually absent in smaller towns. Always lock your bike to an immobile object.\nRacism can also be a problem and make your stay an unpleasant experience. Just like anywhere else in Central Europe, there might be instances of glaring, hostile looks; even unprovoked questioning by the police in big cities like Graz or Vienna is not uncommon. However, racism is almost never seen in a violent form. In more remote parts of Austria, non-white people are a rare sight. If you see elderly locals giving you strange looks there, don't feel threatened. They are probably just showing curiosity or a distrust of foreigners and have no intention of doing any physical harm. A short conversation can often be enough to break the ice. Muslim visitors should note that the burqa and niqab are illegal in Austria.\nDo not walk on the bike lanes (especially in Vienna) and cross them like you would cross any other road. Some bike lanes are hard to recognize (e.g. on the \"Ring\" in Vienna) and some cyclists drive quite fast. Walking on bike lines is not only considered to be impolite, but it may also happen that you are hit by a cyclist.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\nAustria has an excellent healthcare system by Western standards. Hospitals are modern, clean, and well-equipped. Healthcare in Austria is funded by the Krankenkassen (Sickness-funds), compulsory public insurance schemes that cover 99% of the population. Most hospitals are owned and operated by government bodies or the Krankenkassen. Private hospitals exist, but mainly for non-life-threatening conditions. Doctor's surgeries on the other hand are mostly private, but most accept patients from the Krankenkassen. Many Austrians choose to buy supplemental private health insurance. This allows them to see doctors that don't accept Krankenkassen and to stay in special hospital wards with fewer beds (which often receive preferential treatment).\nIf you are a traveller from the EU, you can get any form of urgent treatment for free (or a small token fee) that is covered by the Krankenkassen. Non-urgent treatment is not covered. Simply show your European Health Insurance Card and passport to the doctor or hospital. When going to a GP, watch out if the street sign says \"Alle Kassen\" (all Krankenkassen accepted), or \"Keine Kassen\" (no Krankenkassen accepted), in which case your EHIC is not valid. Supplemental travel insurance is recommended if you want to be able to see any doctor or go to the special ward.\nIf you are a traveller from outside the EU, and have no travel insurance, you will need to pay the full cost of treatment up-front (with the exception of the emergency room). Medical bills can be very expensive, though still reasonable when compared to the USA.\nAustria has a dense network of helicopter ambulances that can reach any point in the country within 15 minutes. Beware: Mountain rescue by helicopter is not covered by your EHIC, or indeed most travel insurances. If you have a medical emergency while you are in the mountains (e.g. you break a leg while skiing), the helicopter will be called on you regardless of whether you ask for it or not, and you will be billed upwards of \u20ac1000. Mountain sports insurance is therefore highly recommended; you can obtain this from your health insurer or by becoming a member of the Austrian Alpine Club (\u20ac48.50 for one year of membership, automatic insurance for mountain search-and-rescue costs up to \u20ac22000).\nCertain regions in Austria (Carinthia, Styria, Lower Austria) are affected by tick borne encephalitis. For those who plan on doing outdoor activities in spring or summer a vaccine is strongly recommended. Also be aware that there is a small, endangered population of sand vipers in the south.\nTap water is of exceptional quality and safe to drink in Austria (except in some parts of lower Austria, where it is recommended to ask about the water quality first!). The quality of water in Vienna and Graz is supposedly comparable to that of Evian.\n\n\nRespect\n\nAustrians take formalities and etiquette seriously and good manners (Gutes Benehmen) can take you a long way in a social situation.\n\nWhen entering and leaving public places Austrians always say hello (Guten Tag or Gr\u00fc\u00df Gott) and goodbye (Auf Wiedersehen). When entering a small shop, one should say \"Gr\u00fc\u00df Gott\" to the shop keeper when entering and \"Wiedersehen\" when leaving (the \"Auf\" is normally left off). Phone calls are usually answered by telling your name, and finished with Auf Wiederh\u00f6ren.\nDo not raise your voice, lose your temper, or shout in public; in Austria this is highly frowned upon.\nWhen being introduced to someone, always shake them by the hand, keep the other hand out of your pocket, say your name and make eye contact. Failure to make eye contact, even if out of shyness, is considered condescending.\nIt is a custom to kiss one's cheeks twice when friends meet, except for Vorarlberg, where people kiss each other three times as in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Fake air kisses work too. When you're not sure whether this is appropriate, wait until your counterpart starts the greeting.\nWhen drinking alcohol you don't drink until you have toasted (\"ansto\u00dfen\"). Say \"prost\" or \"cheers\" and most importantly make eye contact when toasting.\nSmoking is prohibited in most indoor venues and certain outdoor spaces as well. Since 2019, there is a complete smoking ban in gastronomy (restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s, etc.) as well as hotels, certain public areas, government facilities, public transport (as well as e.g. train stations, which may offer \"smoking areas\") etc.\nIf you have drunk all your wine and want more it's okay to pour some more into your glass, but only after you've kindly asked everyone around you at the table if they need any more.\nIf you really want to show your manners while eating, let your unused hand rest on the table next to your plate and use it occasionally to hold your plate while eating, if necessary. Austrians use generally European table manners, that is, they hold the knife in the right hand and the fork in the left hand, eating with both utensils. It is polite to let your wrists or hands rest on the table, but not your elbows.\nIn most Austrian households it is customary to take off one's shoes.\nAustrians really love to use honorific titles. Many books have been written on the subject of Austria and its Titelwahn (title craze). There are over nine hundred titles from many categories such as job descriptions, academic degrees, honorary titles, official titles, etc. People who think of themselves as being respectable always expect to be addressed by their proper title, be it Prof., Dr., Mag. (Master's), Dipl.Ing. (Master's in Engineering), Ing. (Graduate Engineer) or even B.A. This is especially true of older people. Younger people are generally much more relaxed in this regard. The Titelwahn is something to be aware of but it is also often a subject of satire and self-deprecating humour so it should not be taken too seriously. Foreigners are not expected to understand or care about (all of) it.\nIn German you should always use the Sie form when speaking with strangers or older people. Du is mainly reserved for friends and family. Younger people generally address each other with du. Misusing those forms is considered rude, although people most likely understand that as a foreigner you don't know better. Switching between the forms can be very irritating to English speakers, but it is good to use the right form for the right situation. However, if you slip, people will excuse that as due to your limited language skills. In Tyrol the du form is used more frequently than elsewhere.\nPerhaps surprisingly for a rather conservative nation, Austria's attitude towards nudity is one of the most relaxed in Europe. The display of full nudity in the mainstream media and advertising can be a shock for many visitors, especially those from outside Europe. It is not uncommon for women to bathe topless in beaches and recreational areas in summer. Though swimming costumes must normally be worn in public pools and beaches, when bathing \"wild\" in rivers and lakes is normally OK to take one's clothes off. Nudity is compulsory in Austria's many nude beaches (FKK Strand), health spas and hotel saunas. Like in Germany, do not wear bathing suits into saunas.\n\n\nHelpful hints\nAustrians are their own people; referring to them as \"Germans\" is incorrect and may cause offense. The customs of Austria differ from those of Germany and other German-speaking nations.\nIn business settings, business communication tends to be formal and political. Your Austrian counterparts will normally be very careful about what they say.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nCalling Austria\nThe international code for Austria is +43.\n\n\nPhones\nPublic phones are available in some postal offices. Phone boxes are getting rare. Phone boxes usually operate with prepaid cards which can be obtained from postal offices and kiosks (German:Trafik).\nPhone numbers have an area code followed by the phone number itself. Toll-free numbers are denoted by 0800, service lines priced like local calls are setting off with 0810 whereas numbers starting with 0900, 0901, 0930 or 0931 are expensive service lines charging up to \u20ac3.63 per minute. 05 is \"shared cost\" (usually a bit more expensive than landline/mobile), beware of the exception 05133 though which is the Austrian federal police prefix. 0720 is VOIP/virtual - usually billed at landline rates regardless of location.\nTo enjoy cheap international calls from Austria you can use low-cost dial-around services such as austriaphone [3] or fuchstarife [4]. Dial-around services are directly available from any landline in Austria. No contract, no registration is required. Most dial-around services offer USA, Canada, Western Europe and many other countries at the price of a local call so you can save on your phone expenses easily. They also work from public payphones.\n\n\nCell phones\nAustria has good GSM and 3G (UMTS) network coverage of nearly 100%. Be aware that some remote areas (especially mountainous areas) do not have network coverage, though this rather the exception than the rule. Even the Vienna underground lines do have coverage.\nAustria has three network operators: A1, Magenta and Drei. Also, there is a big number of providers, which will operate in one of these three networks.\nThe cheapest (discounter) providers are HoT, spusu, bob and yesss.\nYou may often purchase a prepaid SIM card for Austria before you depart from an online vendor [5] which can be convenient as you get instructions in English and your cell phone number before you depart.\n\n\nInternet\nInternet cafes are common in bigger cities. Hotels in cities do normally have internet terminals, more expensive hotels provide internet access directly in the rooms. There are many free WiFi Hotspots (\"Gratis WLAN\"), each McDonald's has free Wifi (unlimited Time and Traffic) and for example in Mariahilferstrasse in Vienna\nMobile broadband providers in Austria are some of the cheapest and fastest in Europe, and 3G coverage is excellent most populated areas. Several providers offer pay-as-you-go plans that are open to non-residents, don't require registration, and can be topped up with vouchers available in stores, at the ATM, or online.\nBob offers a SIM or Micro-SIM with 1 GB of traffic on a pay-as-you-go plan. Additional traffic can be booked on a data plan (\"Datenpaket\" [6] at a rate of \u20ac4 per GB. Beware of higher rates for traffic (\u20ac0.068/MB) if no data plan is booked. Available at all post offices and some supermarkets. (Ask for \"Bob Breitband Startpaket\", \u20ac14.90). SIMs come with a working cell number, and are also available bundled with a USB Modem without a contract. (2011)\nYesss (an Orange subsidiary) offers SIM or Micro-SIM-cards with 1 GB of traffic for \u20ac9.90 and a pay-as-you go plan. Additional traffic can be bought for \u20ac20 for 2GB. Available at Hofer Supermarkets (ask for \"Yesss startpaket\" at the cashier). SIMs come with a working cell number, and are also available bundled with a USB modem without a contract. (2011)\nA1 offers mobile internet prepaid data SIMs \u2014 Internet mit Wertkarte \u2014 via their webshop for delivery to any address in Austria. (pickup at your hotel) Payment can be made using credit card and they also provide package tracking. Prices start at \u20ac10 for 3GB/30 days with 4/2 Mbit/s. (2013)\n\n\nCope\n\n\nToilets\nPublic toilets are free in most cities. In more touristy areas and train stations, however, fees are normal. Prices range between \u20ac0.20 and \u20ac1, which must either be handed to a toilet attendant or inserted into a slot. Public toilets can always be found in city centers (normally on the main square), in train stations, and near major tourist attractions.\n\n\nLaundry\nHouseholds without washing machines are almost unheard of in Austria. As a result, laundrettes are few and far between, and may be completely absent from smaller cities. However, most hotels, youth hostels, campsites and even B&Bs normally offer laundry facilities for a small charge.\n\n\nPeople\nPeople in Austria are friendly and helpful. Most Austrians are very polite and treat tourists well.",
