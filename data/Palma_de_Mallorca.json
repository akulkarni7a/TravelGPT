  "extract": "Palma de Mallorca is the chief city of the island of Mallorca, and the capital of the entire Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean. With a population of 423,000 in 2022, it's home to half the people of Mallorca, and in summer feels like it contains half the people of Europe. A swathe of boxy hotels stretches out for 20 km on either side, and its airport is the entry point for all the resorts on the island. Yet for all the modern mediocrity, Palma retains a fine Old Town, with the highlights its cathedral and royal palace.\nPalma is also the admin centre for the uninhabited Cabrera islands 20 km south of Mallorca. They're a national park; boat trips visit but they're not described here. \n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThis island has been settled since 2500 BC, and the city of Palma was founded by the Romans in 123 BC. They used it as their port for trade with mainland Spain and North Africa, while Pollentia was their port for Rome, Greece and the east Med. Their rule lasted almost eight centuries but as their power waned, Mallorca was attacked by Vandals and by the Arabs of North Africa. In 902 AD it fell to the Emirate of Cordoba. In 1229 it was conquered by King Jaime I, ruler of Valencia and Aragon, who made Palma the seat of his Kingdom of Majorca. In the 16th century it was ravaged by attacks from Turkish and Berber pirates and through plague. An era of stability began from 1716 when the Bourbon royal dynasty came to power, and the city was boosted by trade with the Caribbean.\nMallorca has sometimes been a place of refuge, for instance from Napoleonic forces in the early 19th century. At the onset of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 it was held by the Nationalists; the Republicans landed in strength and fought their way 12 km inland, but Nationalist air power drove them out within a month. \nTourism had begun in the 1880s, but only blossomed from the 1950s as the Balearics came within range of flights from north Europe, and a rash of hotels spread along the coast. In spite of these, the city retains much of its ancient splendour, centred on its cathedral and palace. Palma is an all-year destination but the holiday peak is May through September. The sea breeze keeps the temperature in check, seldom much above 25 \u00b0C, and you might need a jacket in the evening.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n\n\nBy plane\n1 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI  IATA) (9 km southeast of Palma), \u260f +34 913 21 10 00. A large busy airport, with daily flights from many European cities, the UK, North Africa and within Spain. Opened in 1960, it shares its two runways with Son Sant Joan air force base. For practical purposes it operates as a single terminal, then after check-in and security your departure is from one of four \"modules\". Typically Module A is non-Schengen, B is small planes to Ibiza and Menorca, and C is Schengen, but check the screen. The airport has the usual facilities including car hire.   (updated May 2024)\nOnward transport: EMT buses are blue, white and green and run year-round. Bus A1 runs to city centre (Porta des Camp, Sindicat Interchange, Railway Station, Alemanya Interchange and Passeig Mallorca) every 15 minutes from 06:15 to midnight then at 01:00, 02:00 and 03:00. Bus A2 runs southeast to S'Arenal hourly from 06:15 to 22:15. In 2024 the single adult fare for either is \u20ac5. You can pay on board; buying from the machine in the terminal costs the same but is also valid for one transfer. Bus 34 runs hourly from the airport to the north suburbs and Son Espases, but you're unlikely to use it. \nTIB buses are red and yellow, and run April-Oct to other towns:\n\nA11 goes west to Portals Nous, Costa d'en Blanes, Son Caliu, Palmanova, Magaluf, Santa Pon\u00e7a, Galatz\u00f3, Peguera and Camp de Mar.\nA32 goes northeast to Inca, Sa Pobla, Alc\u00fadia, Platja de Muro and Can Picafort.\nA42 goes east to Algaida, Montu\u00efri, Vilafranca, Manacor, Portocristo, S'Illot, Sa Coma, Cala Millor and Cala Bona.\nA51 goes southeast to S'Arenal, Llucmajor and Campos.\nA taxi ride to city centre costs \u20ac28 daytime, \u20ac34 midnight to 05:00, and takes 15 minutes in normal traffic. See Welcome Pick-ups for rates to other towns - these are usually the best option for families or groups.\n\n\nBy boat\nFerries sail to Palma from Barcelona (7 hr), Denia (5 hr) and  Valencia (7 hr). Inter-island ferries sail to Palma from Ibiza (2-4 hr), Formentara (4 hr) and Mahon on Menorca (6 hr). \nFerry lines are Trasmed, Bale\u00e0ria and GNV. There are no ferries to Mallorca from France, Italy or North Africa.\nCruise liners often call at Palma as they tour the Med.\n2 Palma de Mallorca ferry port is 2 km southwest of town centre.\n\n\nBy road\n\nAll roads and routes converge on Palma from around the island. About the furthest point you could come from, Cala Ratjada on the east coast, is 83 km and takes 70 min. TIB buses run the out-of-town routes and EMT within Palma. \nThere are no road links from the other Balearic islands, nor plans to build any.\n\n\nBy train\n3 Estacio Intermodal is the main train, bus and metro station, underground at Pla\u00e7a d'Espanya. Metre-gauge trains run to Inca, Sa Pobla and Manacor, see TIB for timetables and fares. \nFerrocarril de Soller is the quaint wooden electric train (914 m gauge) to S\u00f3ller - these depart from across the street at C d'Eusebi Estada. See Tren de S\u00f3ller for timetables and fares. At S\u00f3ller a tram continues to the coast.\n\n\nGet around\nBuses within Palma city and its beach strip are run by EMT and are frequent. Bus CC orbits city centre M-F every 40 min and is free. Standard fares in 2024 are \u20ac2 within the city, \u20ac3 to the sea port and \u20ac5 to the airport, pay on board, no transfers permitted. A prepaid card for ten trips within the city is \u20ac15. \nTrains to Inca and the Metro to Son Sardina and UIB make several stops in the north suburbs, but these are residential and industrial areas of no interest to most visitors.\nThe inner streets are too narrow and crowded for comfortable cycling, but bike is a good option further out along the beach. There are eight bike rental shops in city centre and half-a-dozen more down the eastern strip beyond the airport.\nTaxis wait at the port, airport and bus & railway station.\n\n\nSee\n\nA total  solar eclipse on Wednesday 12 Aug 2026, starting at 20:31 and lasting 90 seconds. The chances of a clear sky are 65%, and you need a clear view to the northwest horizon, as the sun will be setting over the sea.\n\n\nCity centre\nEl Casco Antiguo is the historical centre, encompassing most city sights such as the cathedral and Royal Palace. It's a pleasant area to stroll, with narrow shady streets and glimpses of private courtyards. It's bounded by city walls (Dalt Murada) with an inner elevated plaza, while the ring-road outside zig-zags past the Vauban fortifications.\n1 Palma Cathedral (La Seu), Pla\u00e7a de la Seu, \u260f +34 971 713133, info@catedraldemallorca.org.

It was started in 1229 but only completed in 1601, in mostly Gothic style; Gaud\u00ed had a go at improving it but quit in a strop. The Royal Chapel is the resting place of kings Jaime II and III. You can ascend the tower for an extra \u20ac15, but it's a lot of steps. The standard ticket includes Museo de Arte Sacro (aka Museu Dioces\u00e0), with religious paintings and silverware; this has a separate entrance east. Adult \u20ac10.   (updated May 2024)\nSes Voltes is the plaza south side of the cathedral. It has views over Parc de la Mar and sometimes hosts events.\n Royal Palace of La Almudaina (west side of cathedral).

(updated May 2024)\nSanta Eul\u00e0lia is an attractive gothic church 100 m west of Sant Francesc, but many visitors feel it's not worth the \u20ac5.\n3 Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March Palma, C de Sant Miquel 11, \u260f +34 971 710428.

An unusual circular castle enclosing a courtyard, built in the 14th century over a Moorish fort.

Its hilltop site commands good views of the city and the bay. Adult \u20ac4, conc or child \u20ac2.

Flower girls, street touts and other \"distractors\" may be working in cahoots with them.\nOld Town and El Terreno can be sleazy at night. There are lots of drug misusers, and drink-spiking is not uncommon.\nThe people of Mallorca regard themselves as Catalan, not Spanish. Respect this, though your roto attempts to speak mainland (Castilian) Spanish will earn more kudos than insisting on English.\n\n\nGo next\nAll the rest of Mallorca is within an hour or so of Palma. S\u00f3ller is a charming small town, reached on the rinky-dinky wooden train.\nFerries sail to the other Balearic islands, and  Ibiza city is within a day trip.\nFerries also sail to the Spanish mainland.",
