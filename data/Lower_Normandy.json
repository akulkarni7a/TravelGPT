  "extract": "Lower Normandy (French: Basse-Normandie) comprises the western half of Normandy in northern France.\nAdministratively, the region was divided into three departments whose borders are shown on the map: Manche on the west, Calvados east of that along the coast, and Orne inland on the south side. The northern part of Manche is the Cotentin Peninsula, also called the Cherbourg Peninsula,\nThis part of France saw intense fighting during the Second World War; the D-Day beaches, where the Allies landed in June 1944, are along the coast in Calvados, and the fighting soon extended to other parts of the region.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Caen \u2014 capital of the region\n2 Alen\u00e7on\n3 Argentan\n4 Arromanches-les-Bains\n5 Avranches\n6 Bayeux \u2014 location of the famous Tapestry\n7 Cherbourg - port with ferries to UK and Ireland\n8 Deauville \u2014 beach resort\n9 Falaise \u2014 birthplace of William the conqueror\n10 Granville\n11 Honfleur \u2014 17th-century harbor; stay a few day or see at least the impressive wooden church\n12 Lisieux \u2014 birthplace of Ste Therese and pilgrimage city\n13 Mont Saint Michel - UNESCO World Heritage Norman Benedictine Abbey on an island rock isolated by the high tide.\n14 Ouistreham\n15 Saint-L\u00f4\n16 Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise\n17 Sallenelles\n18 Trouville-sur-Mer\n19 Vire\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 D-Day beaches of the Normandy landings near Caen. D-Day circuits are signposted, and take you around Normandy retracing the history of the 1944 events in the Region. Details can be obtained through the Official Site.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nTalk\nFrench is the official language, and all the locals will speak it. Some may use some non-standard expressions, but most will make the effort not to use them if you are foreign.\nLocal expressions you might encounter are 'Tant\u00f4t' (Soon), meaning either this morning, this afternoon, tomorrow morning/afternoon or yesterday morning/afternoon, depending of the speaker, so ask for details.\nAs Normandy is a premium tourist destinations, many of the younger people will speak English, and will be willing to speak it. Spanish, Italian, and German are also quite widely studied at school.\nAlthough there are Norman languages, they are mostly dying out, and the speakers will also speak French. You may also meet the occasional speaker of the neighbouring regions' local languages, such as Breton or Picard, but in any case, a stranger would address you only in French (or maybe English if you were in a tourist area).\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy boat\nThere is a ferry-port in Ouistr\u00e9ham, with ferries to Portsmouth with Brittany Ferries. Another popular option with the locals is the crossings run by LD Lines to Le Havre and Dieppe from Newhaven and Portsmouth, which are sometimes substantially cheaper. Cherbourg, Calais and Saint-Malo are also within driving distance.\nBrittany Ferries\nLD Lines\nA Ferry To: Price Comparison site\n\n\nBy train\nRail is the most commonly used public transport in France for inter-regional travel. It is cheap, fast and reliable. Check out reductions for under-26, over-25 and group travellers. Tickets can usually be bought abroad, on the internet, at stations; in advance or on the day.\nCaen is the main station, alongside Lisieux, Bayeux, Trouville-Deauville and Cabourg-Dives. There are also stations in Lison, Le Molay Littry, Audrieu, Bretteville Norrey, Fr\u00e9nouville Cagny, M\u00e9zidon, Moult Argences, St Pierre sur Dives, Coulib\u0153uf, Le Grand Jardin, Pont L'\u00c9v\u00eaque, Blonville Bennerville, Villers/Mer, Houlgate and Dives Port-Guillaume.\nTrains go towards Saint-L\u00f4 (Cherbourg and Rennes), Paris (2 hours away), Alen\u00e7on (Le Mans), and Rouen.\nSNCF website\n\n\nBy car\nRoads in France are good.\nThe main motorway is the A13 to Caen from Paris (225km / 139 miles). It then continues to Cherbourg (although it is not always a motorway). Some of it is toll, but quite cheap. The A84 goes from Caen to Rennes. You can also take the RN13 from Paris, which is free.\nTo cross the Seine, you can use the Pont de Normandie between Le Havre and Honfleur. Toll is \u20ac5 for a car. A popular site in itself, the bridge, which opened in 1995, at the time was the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world, and had the record for the longest distance between piers; these records were lost in 1999 and 2004 respectively.\nThere is a free bridge further south at Tancarville, and more bridges as you go further south (where the Seine isn't as wide).\n\n\nGet around\nA very common method of getting around Normandy in general is to go by car, since distances between the beautiful sights that Normandy has to offer are far from another. While travelling on own terms, a road atlas will come in very handy. Car rentals are a common and convenient method of travelling, while other means of transportation such as train, car pooling or even coach do count as a valuable alternatives.    \nSeveral comparison sites such as vivanoda [1] fromAtoB [2]  may provide helpful assistance in deciding how to arrive at a certain sight in Normandy.\n\n\nDrink\nThe Calvados region produces a famous, and very potent, apple brandy which is usually just called Calvados. It is readily available anywhere in France and widely exported, but may be cheaper or better here. Guided tours are also available at some distilleries, for example Chateau de Bruil near Lisieux.\n\n\nGo next\nUpper Normandy\nBrittany\nPays de la Loire\nCentre-Val de Loire",
