  "extract": "Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes is a large region in southeastern France. It is popular with all kinds of visitors, from mountaineers and winter sports enthusiasts, to gastronomes, wine buffs, and those looking for a city break. To the west, Auvergne is a mostly rural area of medium volcanic mountains (the Massif Central) and an abundance of interesting churches. Visitors to the Rhone Valley in the centre of the region can enjoy a temperate climate, rocky canyons, extensive vineyards and the urban area of Lyon, one of France's most important cities. In the east, the stunningly beautiful French Alps are havens for all manner of outdoor activities, not least skiing.\n\n\nSubregions\n\n\nCities and towns\n\n1 Lyon \u2014 capital of the region and one of France's largest cities\n2 Annecy \u2014 charming old town and stunning lake, with a wealth of canals\n3 Aurillac \u2014 the end of August brings the annual street theatre festival\n4 Chamb\u00e9ry \u2014 once the capital of the Duchy of Savoie, and the birthplace of the Rights of Man\n5 Chamonix \u2014 the heart of Alpine France; the natural base for exploring Mont Blanc\n6 Clermont-Ferrand \u2014 a city of modern industry ringed by extinct volcanoes\n7 Grenoble \u2014 large academic centre surrounded by mountains\n8 Saint-\u00c9tienne \u2014 perhaps best known to football fans, this is a topographically interesting city\n9 Samo\u00ebns \u2014 a charming and typical example of a French mountain village\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Le Grand Massif - one of France's top skiing areas at a relatively low altitude.\n2 Mont Blanc - at 4,810 m, is the highest summit in the European Union.\n3 Portes du Soleil - international skiing destination on the Franco-Swiss border.\n4 Puy-de-D\u00f4me - stunning rock pinnacle topped with antennae, often hidden in clouds. Look out for eagles.\n5 Vanoise - a massif on the French-Italian border with large ski resorts.\n6 Vercors - a prealpine massif with diverse landscapes and some wilderness areas away from the pistes.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAuvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes has a huge diversity of landscapes due to its climactic and topographic variation. The topography of the region consists of two areas of high elevation, divided by the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, which runs north-south. The western mountains are part of the Massif Central. It is an area of high hills and plateaux, mostly made of old, acidic metamorphic rock. There are several recently extinct (geologically-speaking) volcanoes in this range. East of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley are the Alps. These tall, young mountains are themselves very diverse, and should be divided into at least two groups. A central part of the region is occupied by a north-south line of well-defined mountainous massifs: from north to south, Bornes, Bauges, Chartreuse, Vercors and Baronies. These mountains are mainly made of limestone and are becoming a karst landscape. Another, less prominent valley divides this central area from the eastern part of the region, the Alps proper, which contains some of Europe's highest mountains, most notably Mont Blanc. These mountains are made of acidic rocks such as granite.\nThe diverse climate of the region is due to a blending of four weather influences: Mediterranean in the south, Alpine in the east, Continental in the north, and Atlantic in the west. The region is well-known overseas for its agriculture, and particularly its wine industry. Lyon is considered the culinary capital of France, if not of all Europe, and there are many dishes of great renown from all around the region; see the Eat and Drink sections for more information on this.\nAuvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes was created in 2016 with the merger of the old regions of Auvergne and Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, as part of the national territorial reform. Unlike elsewhere in France, local politicians were unable to agree on a brand new name for the larger region (other exciting proposals included \"Auvergne-Alpes\" and \"Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes-Auvergne\"), so the provisory alphabetic amalgamation of the old names stuck.\n\n\nTourist information\n Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Tourisme. \n Office in Lyon, 11 bis quai Perrache. \n Office in Clermont-Ferrand, 59 boulevard L\u00e9on Jouhaux. \n\n\nTalk\n\nFrench is the first language of nearly everyone living in the region, and locals will appreciate all efforts at speaking French even if your proficiency is not great. Like elsewhere in France, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes has its own regional languages which still cling on despite an almost complete lack of support from the government. Native to the Alpine region and northern Rhone valley, Arpitan (or Franco-Proven\u00e7al) is a close relative of French, but the two are not mutually-intelligible. In the Auvergne and more southerly parts of the region, Occitan is spoken, as it is across the rest of southern France. Here, the local dialect of Occitan is called Auvergnat.\nVisitors with limited or no grasp of French should be able to cope in large towns and cities and in the ski resorts, which are all popular with international tourists. As well as English, locals and tourist professionals may be conversant in German and Italian. Like elsewhere in the country, if you venture off the tourist trail into more rural parts, you may find it more difficult finding people who speak your language.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n\n\nMajor airports\nGeneva International Airport (GVA IATA), though not in either Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes or even France (it is just over the border in Switzerland), Geneva has by far the widest range of international flights of any airport in the area, due to its important role in world diplomacy. The airport welcomes flights from pretty much everywhere in Europe and the Middle East, as well as transatlantic crossings from New York JFK, Newark and Washington Dulles and a solitary far-eastern link to Beijing Capital. Passengers on 'domestic' flights from France leave the airport on the French side, without ever having to officially enter Switzerland, while all other passengers must leave on the Swiss side. As Switzerland is a member of the Schengen agreement, this should pose no additional visa troubles.\nLyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport (LYS IATA), named for pioneering aviator and Lyon native Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, handles flights from all over Europe and North Africa. The only transatlantic flight is an Air Canada service from Montreal Trudeau.\n\n\nMinor and seasonal airports\nChamb\u00e9ry Airport (CMF IATA) operates in winter for the annual skiing season. It receives flights from plenty of European cities, including several competing services from Moscow Domodedovo. Outside of winter, don't expect to be able to fly there.\nClermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport (CFE IATA) serves a limited number of regular flights from around France (including Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly) and Europe (Amsterdam Schiphol, London Luton, London Stansted and Porto)\nGrenoble Is\u00e8re Airport (GNB IATA) is also pretty much entirely seasonal. During the winter ski months, there are direct services from many British and European airports, and even from as far afield as Tel Aviv Ben Gurion, while the rest of the year, only Ryanair offers regular flights from London Stansted.\n\n\nBy train\n\nParis to Lyon was the first TGV (Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse, high-speed train) route to be unveiled all the way back in 1981, and it is still the SNCF's flagship route. Journey times from the appropriately named Paris Gare de Lyon are an impressive 2 hours, much quicker than driving. Lyon is also only 1 hr 45 from Marseille, and around 3 hours from Lille, which has many connections all over northern Europe. Many other destinations in the eastern half of the region are accessible from Paris at around the 2-3 hour mark as well.\nThe western half of the region is not yet on the high-speed rail network, so Intercit\u00e9s journey times from Paris Gare de Bercy to Clermont-Ferrand and the rest of the Auvergne are a more leisurely 3-4 hours. From parts further west (e.g. Bordeaux, the Loire Valley), train connections are poor, with very few direct city to city services, though there is a daily Intercit\u00e9s service from Nantes, Tours and Bourges.\nFrom the United Kingdom, Eurostar now travel direct from London St Pancras and Ashford to Lyon Perrache up to five times a week, taking a respectable 4 hrs 41 mins from London and 4 hrs 12 mins from Ashford. There is also a winter (Dec\u2013Apr) ski service, also from London and Ashford, to Bourg-Saint-Maurice, Mo\u00fbtiers and Aime-la-Plagne. Despite the rather gruelling 7 hour journey time, these services are popular with the English winter sports crowd. Eurostar sells through tickets to many other places in the region, where travellers are required to change onto the local network at Lyon.\n\n\nBy car\n\nFrom Paris, Lyon is around 5 hours in good traffic on the A6 autoroute (motorway), while Clermont-Ferrand is around 6 hours via the A10 and A71 autoroutes. The A89 brings traffic from the west - Bordeaux and the rest of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, while the A7 is the main highway bringing traffic from the south, that is to say Marseille and the rest of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur. There are two tunnels through the Alps from Italy, both leading from Turin. The A6 passes near Dijon, which is a hub for autoroutes from the east of France and ultimately Germany.\nIf you're driving from the United Kingdom, count on 7-10 hours non-stop from Calais, traffic depending. Many people doing this journey like to stop overnight, often in Reims or Troyes.\nFor more detail on the region's autoroute system, see Get around below.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\nThe main motorways (autoroutes, denoted by A##) and routes nationales (denoted by N##) of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes are:\n\nA6: Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9, from Beaune/Paris, M\u00e2con, Lyon (A42, A43, A46), continues as A7\nA7: continuation of the A6 Lyon, N88, Vienne, Valence (N532), Mont\u00e9limar, Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, towards Marseille\nA40 / N205: from A6 near M\u00e2con, A39, Bourg-en-Bresse, A42, Geneva (A41), Cluses (for Samo\u00ebns,  Le Grand Massif, Portes du Soleil), (continues as N205), Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, Chamonix, Mont Blanc Tunnel, Italy towards Aosta and Turin\nA41: Geneva, A40, Annecy, Aix-les-Bains, A43 (W), Chamb\u00e9ry (runs as N201 and A43 around Chamb\u00e9ry), A43 (E), Grenoble (A48, A51)\nA42: Lyon (A6, A7, A43, A46), A40 near Bourg-en-Bresse\n\nA43: Lyon (A6, A7, A42, A46), A41 (N), Chamb\u00e9ry (runs as N201 around Chamb\u00e9ry), A41 (S), Vanoise, Fr\u00e9jus Tunnel, Italy, towards Turin\nA46: passes east of Lyon, as a bypass to the A6 and A7 which go through the city centre.

Toll motorways are marked by the word p\u00e9age.\n\n\nBy train\n\nAside from the TGV, which links the main cities and ski resorts in the eastern half of the region (i.e. the former Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes), the main provider of rail services is TER Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The network is extensive, as you can see on this network map, but the service can be rather slow if you're going a long way. You will find the train to be very good value, however. The few towns which don't have direct rail access are served by SNCF buses (autocars) which link in with the train network and use the same tickets and fare system.\nThis being a mountainous region, many of the rail journeys are scenic. Highlights include the Mont Blanc Express which makes the spectacular climb from Saint-Gervais-les-Bains to Chamonix, before tunnelling under the Alps and heading down to the Swiss town of Martigny. While this and other gorgeous journeys are integrated into the regular rail network, there are also lines which are purely destined for the tourist market, such as the AGRIVAP Discovery Trains which operate a mixture of steam and electric trains with panoramic and open-top carriages through the Livradois-Forez Natural Regional Park between Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand.\n\n\nSee\nMountains! There are literally hundreds to explore, across two primary ranges:\n\nIn the west, the Massif Central is a medium-height range with lush green slopes and extinct volcanoes to explore. In fact, the Auvergne is the largest volcanic region in Europe, though the volcanoes themselves are all dormant or extinct. The Puy-de-D\u00f4me is the most well-known of these. You can also visit an interactive volcanic theme park, Vulcania.\nIn the east, the majestic Alps tower white and grey into the sky, culminating in Mont Blanc. The highest point in western Europe, the 'White Mountain' can be easily viewed from the mountain town of Chamonix. In the summer months, the slopes of the Alps are places to linger among sweet-smelling grass and wildflowers, listening to the tinkle of cow and goat bells and perhaps enjoying a picnic of local produce.\nThe region is liberally sprinkled with fascinating Romanesque churches, often dating to before 1000 AD. Visit, and you will quite likely hear some beautiful music, and definitely see a lot of gorgeous stained glass, set in stone dripping with history. Many parish churches have their pillars painted the way they were when they were built.\n\n\nDo\n\nIn the summer, the region is well known for paragliding, hiking, climbing and canoeing. Particularly attractive are the areas around the Ard\u00e8che, Mont-Blanc, Vanoise and Vercors.\n\n\nWinter sports\nIn the winter months, this is the heart of skiing in France, with many of the largest and most well developed resorts located here. Wikivoyage has split them by area:\n\nAnnecy area - pistes within spitting distance of a cultured city\nChamonix area - hosted the first Winter Olympics in 1924 and has been a winter sports capital ever since\nLe Grand Massif - low altitude resorts that still get plenty of snow\nMeg\u00e8ve area - another low altitude resort in the foothills of the Mont Blanc Massif\nLes Portes du Soleil - a transnational ski area that extends into the Swiss canton of Valais\nSavoie area - otherwise known as the Espace Killy after Jean-Claude Killy. Also includes Les Trois Vall\u00e9es, which claims to be the largest ski area in the world.\n\n\nEat\nSee also: French cuisine\n\nLyon is known as the capital of French gastronomy, and since France has a highly credible claim at possessing the greatest national cuisine in the world, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes is undoubtedly one of the best places for a bite to eat. The regional cuisine is heavily influenced by the mountains, both in the types of product historically available and the need to provide comfort and warmth through the winter. Expect plenty of smoked meats, sausages and of course cheeses. Some of the most well-known regional dishes include:\n\nFondue - A steaming vat of melted cheese (traditionally gruy\u00e8re) that diners consume by dipping small chunks of bread or croutons using an extremely long fork. Fondue, which literally means molten in French, is the classic apr\u00e8s-ski supper, and a national dish of Switzerland. It has, however, become seasonally popular all over France and many restaurants around the country use their own local cheeses in place of gruy\u00e8re. Simply divine.\nGratin dauphinois or pommes de terre \u00e0 la dauphinoise -  Thinly-sliced potato roundels slowcooked in a casserole pot in the oven with milk or cream and garlic. A similar dish, gratin savoyard is made in the Savoie with onions and cheese instead of cream.\nPizza \u00e0 la savoyarde - While pizza is undoubtedly an Italian creation, a recipe which is popular throughout France is made with reblochon and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche as a base topping (i.e. instead of the customary tomato sauce and mozzarella), garnished with lardons, potatoes, onions and an egg.\nPot\u00e9e auvergnate - Cabbage stew, Massif Central style. Made with ham hock, sausages, lard, carrots and the ever-present potatoes. Try it, love it.\nRaclette - Cheese melted by an open fire or on a special electric table-top grill; the melted part is then scraped onto your plate, and served with small firm potatoes, gherkins, pickled onions and charcuteries. A real treat even by local standards, and often reserved for special occasions such as Christmas.\nRavioles - More commonly known in English as ravioli, French ravioles are smaller than those you may be used to, and stuffed with emmental or comt\u00e9 cheese. They serve as the base ingredient for many a tasty dish, including gratins and salads.\nTartiflette - Another potato gratin, oven baked with lardons, onions and melted reblochon.\nTruffade - A sort of gratin-cum-pancake made with sliced potatoes, melted salers cheese and sometimes served with Auvergnat ham. Using similar ingredients but prepared differently is aligot, which uses creamy garlic mashed potato rather than roundels, and thus is closer to a pur\u00e9e. This often acts as an accompaniment to local sausages - French bangers and mash!\nYes, nearly everything is made with melted cheese, potatoes and onions! The key to French cuisine lies in a small number of high quality locally-sourced ingredients cooked in extraordinary ways, and Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes fits neatly into this groove, presenting fabulously simple cooking beloved by many a traveller. Unusually for France, most of the signature dishes are (or can be, with minimal modification) vegetarian friendly, but vegans and those intolerant to gluten or lactose will probably be disappointed with the preponderance of dairy.\n\n\nCheeses and p\u00e2t\u00e9s\nThere are numerous kinds of local cheese. In Auvergne, the most celebrated are bleu d'Auvergne (blue and pungent), cantal (firm and ancient in heritage), and saint-nectaire (the \"holy nectar\", semi-soft). The Alpine regions are known for producing gruy\u00e8re although in France this is generally called comt\u00e9 to avoid upsetting the Swiss, who claim gruy\u00e8re as their own. Reblochon is an extremely soft and creamy cheese used in cooking. American cheese aficionados may particularly wish to seek this one out as, due its unpasteurised status, it is banned in the United States. Finally, tomme is a generic name for circular cheeses produced all over the region, and which can be made from cow's, ewe's or goat's milk. You may see such varieties as tomme de montagne, tomme de Savoie and tomme de Beaujolais.\nP\u00e2t\u00e9-wise, it should come as no surprise that one of Auvergne's chief recipes is p\u00e2t\u00e9 aux pommes de terre; potato p\u00e2t\u00e9! Elsewhere, caillette de Chabeuil is an excellent little p\u00e2t\u00e9 made of liver and pork meat flavoured with herbs and spices.\n\n\nSweet dishes\nBourriols - an Auvergnat version of cr\u00eapes made with buckwheat, accompanied with the standard cr\u00eape toppings and flavours.\nChocolate fondues - fruit or sweet pastry replace the bread, while the gruy\u00e8re's role is naturally filled by melted chocolate. Yum.\nClafoutis - cherry flan, enjoyed in Auvergne and neighbouring Limousin.\nNougat de Mont\u00e9limar - white nougat made with sugar, honey, egg white, vanilla, almonds, and pistachio nuts or crystallised fruit\nPogne de Romans - a large brioche made with eggs and flavoured with orange flour and rum. The origins of this dish lie in the Middle Ages.\nValrhona - a high-end brand of chocolate manufactured in Tain-l'Hermitage near Lyon since 1922.\n\n\nDrink\n\nThe regional wine scene is dominated by the Rhone Valley (C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne). Wines of this appellation generally use Grenache grapes for reds and ros\u00e9s, and Grenache blanc for whites. More premium varieties have a legally-required higher Grenache content, because the French government has its priorities sorted. The superior versions are called C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne Villages, while the very best are known as Crus, which use the name of their home village rather than the Rhone label. Rhone bottles are known for their longer than average necks, meaning nerdy oenophiles can pick out such a wine without even reading the label.\nOther important appellations of the region are Beaujolais (see infobox), C\u00f4tes d'Auvergne, C\u00f4te roannaise and vin de Savoie. With the exception of Beaujolais, you will most likely only find the best of these in their home areas, as production isn't as extensive as with the better known French labels.\nThe Is\u00e8re is known for its extremely strong (40-55% alcohol content) herbal liqueurs collectively known as Chartreuse. The most common variety is a kind of pea green colour, and is made with no fewer than 130 species of plant. As with many of Belgium's finest beers, Chartreuse production is in the hands of local monks! How the hours of prayer and contemplation must fly.\nThe health-conscious, teetotal or hungover may prefer to sample some of the region's excellent mineral water. Volvic is bottled at source in the volcanic massif of Puy-de-D\u00f4me, while \u00c9vian comes from the town of the same name on the south shore of Lake Geneva.\n\n\nSleep\n\nThe accommodation base in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes is extensive and varied. Every town has at least one hotel, while large cities such as Lyon and resorts such as Chamonix have dozens. The self-catering (g\u00eete) options are abundant as well, from cozy cottages and urban apartments to luxury chalets. The French are keen campers, and so most villages in even vaguely touristy areas have campsites with hookup points for caravans and campervans. Much more information can be found on individual destination articles.\n\n\nStay safe\nThis is a relatively low crime area, one notable issue being occasional theft of expensive ski gear during the winter sports season. The usual\nprecautions should be taken when venturing into the mountains, and avalanches are a recurring and well-publicised threat to safety in the Alps. All the volcanoes in the region are dormant or extinct, but should one decide to wake up, you will have plenty of warning.\n\n\nGo next\n\n\nNeighbouring French regions\nBourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9 - Prosperous agriculture producing some of France's most well-known dishes, and cities worthy of the Burgundian dukes.\nCentre-Val de Loire - Land of luxury ch\u00e2teaux and vineyards lining the majestic river Loire's journey west.\nNouvelle-Aquitaine - Across the Massif Central, France's gorgeous south west and, eventually, the Atlantic coast.\nOccitanie - The Midi of your imagination; sun-drenched plains, Mediterranean resorts, wild Pyrenees.\nProvence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur - Much more than just the French Riviera, Provence's culture and class will enchant, from the peaks of its Alps to the Camargue's soggy bottom.\n\n\nNeighbouring regions in other countries\nNorthwest Italy - for the Italian Alps and Lake District, Piedmont's gastronomy, the Cinque Terre, and Milan\nValais - In Switzerland, discover the Rhone's glacial source, juggle two phrasebooks at once, or conquer the mighty Matterhorn.\nWestern Switzerland - Most of Francophone Switzerland, home of the United Nations, \"real\" fondue, and the Helvetic watch industry.",
