  "extract": "Bel\u00e9m is a city of 1.3 million people (2023) near the mouth of the Amazon River in northern Brazil. It is the gateway to the Amazon River with a busy port, airport, and bus/coach station. Bel\u00e9m lies approximately 100 km upriver from the Atlantic Ocean, on the Par\u00e1 River. It is the capital and largest city of the state of Par\u00e1.\n\n\nUnderstand\nBel\u00e9m is on the banks of the Bay of Guajar\u00e1, which is formed by a set of islands and river mouths on the estuary of the Amazon river. Its river port helps putting into motion the Northern region of Brazil.\nThe city was established in 1616, after the construction of \"Forte do Pres\u00e9pio\", today \"Forte do Castelo\", on the banks the Par\u00e1 river. Bel\u00e9m is, in a way, a synthesis of the culture and the history of Par\u00e1 and the Amazon with native Indian influence in the food and culture. It became an extremely wealthy city with the Rubber Boom at the end of the 19th century and many beautiful colonial buildings from this era are still visible.\nEvery year, on the second Sunday of October, Bel\u00e9m features one of the largest Catholic parades in the world, C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9.\n\n\nClimate\n\nBel\u00e9m is 1.4 degrees south of the equator, in the east of the Amazon rainforest. The city is very hot all year round and it rains almost daily, mostly in the form of sudden afternoon thunderstorms of less than half an hour, at about 15:00. However, between December and May, when most of the rain falls, it can rain for several hours and several times a day. In addition to one of the rainiest, Bel\u00e9m is one of the sunniest cities of Brazil. The average maximum temperatures are around 32\u00b0C, while the minimums are around 23\u00b0C, quite stable throughout the year. Due to humidity, the temperatures can feel significantly higher.\nWith the sunny and humid tropical climate, be prepared to change your clothes frequently and be well hydrated. It is useful to bring an umbrella, to protect you from the sun and rain.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy bus\nHuge bus terminal a few kilometers east of the center. Many local buses pass here.\nIt is possible to travel by air-conditioned coach to Bel\u00e9m from most major points in Brazil. However, due to its relative isolation, travel times can be quite lengthy (Example 27 hours to Fortaleza) - especially from the south.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Val de Cans International Airport (BEL  IATA). Has regular international flights linking Bel\u00e9m to Cayenne, Georgetown, Paramaribo, Lisbon and Miami, and many direct domestic flights linking Bel\u00e9m to Brasilia, Fortaleza, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Macap\u00e1. Bus Pratinhas to/from Presidente Vargas, and Marex to/from Pr\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica. Taxi to center R$20\u201330 (negotiate!).   \n\n\nBy boat\nPassenger terminal at the north end of the docks. Many daily boats to nearby islands, including twice to Rio Branco.\nAlso to Macap\u00e1, Santar\u00e9m Belem and Manaus, with connections further north and west. Locals sling hammocks to sleep but air conditioned cabins are available on the larger boats. This is a great way to travel see (and hear) the river, and meet people.\nBeware, as soon as you leave the boat you will be greeted by friendly taxi drivers who'll offer you a flat price for the way to your accommodation - their friendly offer is 2 to 3 times the regular fare. Just get out on the street and hail a taxi there.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\nThere is one major long distance coach terminal at S\u00e3o Braz. There are many local busses travelling all over the city at often exhilarating and reckless speeds. The number of buses passing Avenida Presidente Vargas is nothing short of astonishing, and you can get virtually anywhere within Greater Bel\u00e9m from here. The challenge lies in finding the right bus, and also getting on board, as it will stop anywhere on a stretch of some 200\u2013300 metres, or attempt to pass straight. Do as the locals: wave and run for it!\nAnother transport \"hub\" is in front of the bus terminal, next to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1z, only slightly less chaotic.\nMost buses run until about 23:00, but minibuses go virtually around the clock on major roads.\n\n\nBy taxi\nThere are many taxis in the city.  Many taxi drivers are willing to negotiate a fair flat-rate price based on where you want to go.  The taxi fares are far more expensive than the bus fares but if you need to get somewhere fast without waiting or dealing with packed busses, it's a good option.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nIf you for some strange reason find yourself in possession of a bike while in town, there are actually a great number of cycle lanes along the main avenues.\n\n\nSee\n\nBel\u00e9m is a lively and friendly city but it can look quite unappealing at first sight. There are a lot of modern high rises, but between them particularly in Cidade Velha and Campinas there are a vast number of well preserved colonial buildings, from the rubber boom and earlier. Many of the grander ones now house official bodies and there has been a drive to preserve them.\nBel\u00e9m has many attraction, here are some of many attractions the city offers.\n\nMercado Ver-o-Peso (See-the-Weight Market) - by the waterfront, the first and foremost tourist attraction of the whole Par\u00e1 state. The old fish market, a large and lively traditional market, pre-built in England in the 19th century. Here you will find fish, fruit, vegetables, regional items and offers a good insight into traditional local culture.\nEsta\u00e7\u00e3o das Docas (Revitalised docks with bars, shops, music etc. next to Ver O Peso)\nComplexo Feliz Lusit\u00e2nia (Complex Happy Portugal)\nCasa das Onze Janelas (House of Eleven Windows)\nMercado Ver-o-Rio (See-the-River), bars and a boating lake.\nForte do Castelo The old fortress in the oldest part of town.\nCatedral da Se The oldest church in Belem.\nPra\u00e7a Batista Campos (Batista Campos Square)\nMuseu de Artes de Bel\u00e9m (Bel\u00e9m Arts Museum)\nMuseu Emilio Goeldi (Em\u00edlio Goeldi Museum). The zoo.\nPra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica (The Square of the republic). The main square with statues and the Teatro da Paz.\n Teatro da Paz (Theater of Peace), Pra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica. Tu-F 09:00-17:00, Sa 09:00-14:00. Rivals the Manaus opera house as a symbol of the rubber boom's riches. Guided tours every hour on the hour last 30 minutes. R$4, Tuesdays free. \nBosque Rodrigues Alves (Botanical Garden Bosque Rodrigues Alves). A large section of the original forest (with some a lake, fish, animals and a cafe) perhaps a square kilometer in area, ten minutes by car from the city centre.\nMangal das Gar\u00e7as - the region's vegetation, animals and food can be appreciated in this large park for tourists, just off the city centre.\n\n\nDo\nMany of the city's highlights can be taken in with a walk along the rivers edge, starting with the docks and continuing to the old fort. Numerous old churches along the way are worth a look, and the bustling market life is not to be missed.\n\n\nEat\nBel\u00e9m has a range of regional specialties. See Par\u00e1 for the full menu.\n\nRegional Ice Creams: made with fruits like A\u00e7a\u00ed, Cupua\u00e7\u00fa, Tapereb\u00e1, Bacur\u00ed, Graviola, etc. Best ice cream maker is Sorveteria Cair\u00fa, several branches around town, including at Docas (Station of the docks).\nTacac\u00e1: a delicious soup made with shrimp, tucupi (a broth made with wild cassava) and jambu (Acmella oleracea). It must be served extremely hot in a cuia and it can be served with pepper or not.\n\nCaldeirada Paraense: is made with fish, shrimp, eggs, onion, potatoes, tomatoes, red pepper, tucupi and jambu. It must be served hot with rice and pir\u00e3o.\nMani\u00e7oba: is made with leaves of Manihot, salted pork, dried meat and some smoked ingredients, such as bacon.\n\nPato no Tucupi: is made with duck (pato), jambu and tucupi, the same liquid used to prepare Tacac\u00e1.

Single R$55. \n\n\nStay safe\nBel\u00e9m is now a large city, take care when walking after nightfall along  Presidente Vargas and the back streets that lead off from it. Although no worse (and perhaps better) than other Brazilian cities there is still a lot of poverty so try not to have jewellery or cameras on show when walking around. The city is generally safe and friendly during daytime. Estacao das Docas is always a safe if rather touristy option. The Umarizal area has up market local bars and restaurants. Avenida Joao Paulo Segundo (previously called Avenida Premeiro de Dezembro) has some more \"down to earth\" and very local bars. Generally there is a lot of night life Thursday, Friday and Saturday ask for advice. Although worth a visit try and avoid Estacao da Docas which is really only for tourists.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\n\nGo next\n\nIlha do Mosqueiro is the closest beach area (after Outeiro) to Bel\u00e9m, some 80 km away. The island is surrounded by sandy river beaches (some developed more than others) with fresh water and because of the size of the estuary often large waves. Buses at least every half hour from the bus station. Boats on weekends and high season.\nIcoaraci some 25 km north of the centre offers a pleasant bayside walk with quite a few bars and restaurants. Car ferry for Ilha do Maraj\u00f3 leaves from here. Local buses from downtown.\nSalin\u00f3polis or Salinas offers the nearest sea beaches. It is a beautiful place with nice beaches (Atalaia, Ma\u00e7arico, Farol Velho etc...), a three hours from Bel\u00e9m, and it is a good place to visit/stay (at least one night). The original town is Salinopolis. Atalaia and Farol Velho are beautiful beaches except at weekends and holidays when they can resemble car parks with thousands of visiting cars from Belem. If you drive along the beach far enough you will get away from the crowds, but if you have a car be careful of soft sand and the tide!\nIlha do Maraj\u00f3 is possible as a day trip, but consider spending at least one night. Many agencies offer packages, but you can mostly get along cheaper on your own. [1]\nIlha de Algodoal is a beautiful Island, and there is one of the most preserved beaches in the North of Brazil in there (Princess beach).\nCrispim is possible a day trip.\nSantar\u00e9m two hours from Bel\u00e9m by plane. But do consider a two- or three-day boat journey up river (rather less when coming back down with the current).",
