  "extract": "Cape Breton Island is the northernmost island in Nova Scotia. It is a beautifully rugged island, populated by the descendants of Scottish immigrants,  by Acadians, and by the Indigenous Mi'kmaq people. The island is known for its traditional fiddle music, and flourishing Celtic culture.\n\n\nCities and towns\n\n1 Sydney \u2014 largest city on the island\n2 Glace Bay \u2014 the second largest urban area and situated on the east side of the island\n3 North Sydney \u2014 end of the Trans-Canada Highway with ferry connections to Newfoundland\n4 New Waterford  \u2014 former mining town\n5 Sydney Mines  \u2014 a former coal mining town\n6 Pleasant Bay \u2013 the whale watching capital of Cape Breton Island\n7 Port Hastings \u2014 east end of the Canso Causeway\n8 Port Hawkesbury  \u2014 a town on the southwestern end of the island\n9 Baddeck \u2014 summer resort area and convenient starting/finishing point for the Cabot Trail\n10 Ch\u00e9ticamp \u2014 centre of Acadian culture on the Cabot Trail\n11 Louisbourg \u2014 one-time French colonial town best known for its reconstructed fortress\n12 Ingonish \u2014 on the Cabot Trail and adjacent to the Cape Breton Highlands National Park\n13 Arichat  \u2014 a village of Acadian culture on Isle Madame\n14 Mabou  \u2014 fishing and farming community on the west side of the island\n15 St. Peter's \u2014 a small village and the \"Gateway to the Bras d'Or\"\n16 Eskasoni  \u2014 (Eskasoni First Nation) the largest Mi'kmaq community in Nova Scotia\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Cape Breton Highlands National Park \u2013 Atlantic Canada's first national park\n\n\nUnderstand\nCape Breton Island was a separate colony until 1820 when it was merged into Nova Scotia against its will. It is the only place in North America where Gaelic is still spoken, a legacy of the large immigration (about 50,000) from the highlands of Scotland in the first half of the 19th century.  There are also pockets of French, remnants of the Acadian history described in the Longfellow epic poem \"Evangeline\", in towns such as Margaree and Ch\u00e9ticamp and on Isle Madame.\nWith 5 Mi'kmaq communities in Cape Breton (4 are around the Bras d'Or Lake) there is a strong island identity and sense of community, which increasingly unifies the Mi'kmaq population of the island.\nThe island has consistently lost industrial investment and jobs in the past ten years. However, the closing of the coal and steel industry coupled with the presence of the Cape Breton Highlands National Park, which buffers the pristine northern half of the island from its more commercialized southern half, have no doubt contributed to the island's very positive ratings for ecological stewardship and spectacular scenery.  An excellent reference site for the incredibly beautiful northern tip of Cape Breton can be found at the \"Top of the Island\" site.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nThe most common way to get into Cape Breton is by car via the Trans-Canada Highway (Hwy 104) at the Canso Causeway from mainland Nova Scotia.  Cape Breton is approximately 12\u00bd driving hours from Boston, 14 from Hartford and 16 from New York City.\n\n\nBy bus\nMaritime Bus runs between Truro and Sydney with onward connections to much of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\nShuttle service is provided between Halifax and Sydney and environs by several companies who travel at various times throughout the day.  Excellent value.\n\n\nBy plane\nCape Breton Island is served by Sydney Airport (YQY IATA).  \n\n\nGet around\nCape Breton is most accessible by car.  The main roads are the Trans-Canada Highway (Hwy 105) and Highways 104 and 4, which connect Sydney on the east coast with the causeway to the mainland on the west. Highway 125 forms a ring freeway around Sydney, connecting Highways 105, 4, 22 and 28.  You can rent a car in Sydney if necessary.  Like any place, you see more if you get off the main road, and the Nova Scotia government has been helpful in this regard by creating a number of scenic drives.  These include the:\n\nCabot Trail - mountainous, windy and sometimes foggy, this drive alternates between hugging the ocean and crossing the rugged Cape Breton Highlands.  Considered one of the top drives in North America, it should be considered more a destination than a drive for the variety of activities available around this 400-km (190-mile) loop.\nFleur-de-Lis Trail - covers the southern French-influenced part of the island.\nCeilidh Trail - covers the western part the island with its strong Scottish influence.\nBras d'Or Lake Scenic Drive - follows the shoreline of Bras d'Or Lake.\nRoad maps and additional information on the island is readily available at any tourism information centre (located at entry points and any major towns and cities) and a number of private operators offer trip planning services.\n\nA more adventurous option to get around the island is to cycle.  The roads tend to be narrow and windy, so prior experience is recommended.  Bike rental and trip planning are available through Sea Spray Outdoor Adventures.\nHiking trails abound in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, and the above-mentioned Sea Spray Outdoor Adventures offers guided hikes to little-known remote areas north of the national park.\nRegardless of your mode of travel, watch out for moose on the roads.\nThere are many small cable ferries between the islands. They usually go every few minutes and charge $5.\nSalty Bear Adventure Travel - an excellent alternative to renting a car, Salty Bear offers budget adventure tours around the Cabot Trail. Run by passionate travellers who aim to provide a true Cape Breton experience, their trips include roundtrip transportation, accommodation, guide with full commentary, guided hikes, National & Provincial Park access, ferry passes, wildlife encounters, barbecues, bonfires. Discounted optional activities of kayaking, sailing, and whale watching.\n\n\nSee\n\nCape Breton is noted for its unique and vibrant traditional Scottish violin music incubated by its relative isolation over the years- so much so that music lovers from Scotland come here for a taste of their own past. Typically a duo of violin and piano play hearty dance music that can be seen at community halls throughout the island. The early-evening tourist-targeted concerts are well advertised; later at night you can find ones that draw the entire local community. Some of the most important musical centres are Judique, Margaree Valley and Ch\u00e9ticamp.\nThe island ranked second in the world in a National Geographic study of ecotourism conducted in 2002 and 2003.\nCape Breton Highlands National Park. The Cabot Trail runs through the national park. There are many short hiking trails starting along the Cabot Trail.\nScenery is a major reason to visit Cape Breton. Plan to stop along the many spectacular lookoffs on the Cabot Trail - this will lengthen your travel time between destinations. Since the Cabot Trail is more a destination than a drive, visitors seeking to truly experience this environmental masterpiece should plan on staying a minimum of two days in the villages around the Trail. A number of private operators offer trip planning services to assist visitors in taking advantage of the best attractions both on and off the Trail, some offering all-inclusive multi-day packages.\nThe Fortress of Louisbourg is a reconstruction of the 18th-century fortified French town whose presence plagued the British colonies of New England. Its busy harbour was once one of France's most significant economic and military assets in North America. If you enjoy the colonial restoration at Williamsburg in the United States, don't miss Louisbourg.\nThe Bras D'Or is a brackish lake with unique ecological characteristics, and some islands in that lake are sacred to the Mi'kmaq.\n\nBay St. Lawrence and Meat Cove are two scenic fishing villages featuring whale tours, fresh seafood and unique accommodations along the rugged cliffs north of the Cabot Trail. Turn north at Cape North.\n\nJoe's Scarecrows at Cheticamp on the Cabot Trail. Scary gallery of scarecrows with Halloween masks. Entrance is free, but they ask for a small donation.\nLes Trois Pignons in Cheticamp is a museum of Acadian culture based on collection of antiques.\nThe Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site in Baddeck has  exhibits, photos and videos relating to the life and work of the inventor of the telephone.\nThe Cape Breton Miners Museum in Glace Bay has an underground mine tour, and a mining history museum with modern exhibits. Stroll through a historic village. \"Men of the Deeps\" miners' choir offers performances (several times per season.\n\n\nDo\nThere are eight golf courses scattered about the island that will challenge even the most discriminating among you. The views planes alone are worth the walk: coastal links, highland links, and several of the Bras d'Or Lakes.\nThe east side of the island have some of finest beaches in the world but without the crowds. Hiking or lounging are the favourite activities as the water is never very warm. You'll see sea birds, shore birds, seals and surf with nothing between you and Africa but water.\nThe Celtic Colours Festival spans hundreds of events across dozens of towns in early-to-mid-October. The music options at Celtic Colours are not solely Celtic but include folk and some Acadian Zydeco (Acadeco) and jazz, and world music.\nTake a whale watching tour: there are boat tours along the coast from Cheticamp north and around to Englishtown. Sighting of whales is almost guaranteed, especially at the northern tip of the island. Tours takes two hours or more, and the scenery alone is worth the price.  Oshan Whale Cruises and Captain Cox's Whale Tour operate at the northern tip of the island.\nMany people think that biking the Cabot Trail is the best way to see it. Featured in an issue of Bicycling magazine, as \"North America's Best Ride\". Pedal and Sea Adventures can arrange a tour.\nThere is lots of self-guided hiking in the Cape Breton Highlands National Park.\nEagle North and Sea Spray both offer guided kayak tours, in the large tranquil harbours at the top of the island and in the whale-rich Atlantic.\nThe Top of the Island, north and northeast of Cape Breton Highlands National Park, is the most spectacularly scenic region of Cape Breton. It offers a combination of historic, cultural and environmental activities, featuring whale watching, guided hiking, cycling, and paddling tours, museums, artists' studios and galleries and seven miles of the most significant beaches north of the Carolinas. The region is home to Cabot's Landing Provincial Park, the site of John Cabot's landing in 1497.\n\n\nBuy\nMany of the smaller communities have only a general store that sells a very limited selection of groceries and sundries, often also operating as a local post office. Better to stop in a bigger centre like Baddeck or Cheticamp for groceries, although the Top of the Island area has two Co-op grocery stores (somewhat smaller than the Co-ops in Baddeck and Cheticamp) and a couple of independents that, taken together, do a reasonable job.\n\nThe Wreck Cove General Store (pictured) is open year-round and sells things a traveller might need, from fuel to weather-appropriate clothing to snacks. Their \"World Famous Lobster Sandwich\" is highly recommended and can be bought during the summer season. Located on the Cabot Trail between Baddeck and Ingonish.\n\n Floras, Point Cross, \u260f +1 902 224-3139. Handcrafts. Especially traditional Acadian rug-hooking made by locals.

Instructions are given on signs at the entrance of hiking trails, teaching how to proceed when encountering these species that may feel threatened by you. Respect those instructions for your own good. \nCrime is almost non-existent and the weather can be a factor of danger especially in the winter due to its tendency of quickly changing.\n\n\nGo next\nIf you want to do a bit of island-hopping Atlantic Canada-style, you can take one of two ferries from North Sydney to Newfoundland.  The ferry to Port aux Basques on Newfoundland's south-west coast is the shorter of two and runs daily throughout the year. The ferry to Argentia is much longer (about 14 hours) and only runs in the summer, three times a week. Ferry services are provided by Marine Atlantic.",
