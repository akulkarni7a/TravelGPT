It's an incredibly culturally rich and diverse state, blending characteristics of the Portuguese, indigenous and African cultures present in most of Brazil, with those of varied immigrant groups such as German, Polish, Syrian-Lebanese and Japanese.

At the border with Argentina is the National Park of Igua\u00e7u, considered by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. 40 km from there, at the border with Paraguay, the largest dam in the world was built, the Hidroel\u00e9trica de Itaipu (Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam). \nBefore the arrival of European settlers, indigenous populations inhabited the region for thousands of years. They included the Carij\u00f3 in the lands closer to the sea, from the Tupi group, and the Caingangues in the interior, who belonged to the J\u00ea group. In the 1940s, the northern part of the state was settled as a result of the expansion of the S\u00e3o Paulo coffee industry. \nThe main economic activities are agriculture, industry (agribusiness, automotive, and paper) and plant extraction (wood and yerba mate). In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of soybeans, maize, wheat, sugarcane, cassava, beans, tomato, orange and yerba mate.\n\n\nGet in\nAfonso Pena International Airport CWB IATA in Curitiba\nFoz do Igua\u00e7u International Airport in IGU IATA in Foz do Igua\u00e7u\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\nThe Atlantic Forest South-East Reserves \u2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
