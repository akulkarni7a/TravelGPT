  "extract": "Campinas is a city in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil, and the core municipality of the Grande Campinas, a metropolitan area with 2.8 million people, the second largest in the state after Grande S\u00e3o Paulo. Campinas is a major center of industry, services and research, holding the 11th highest GDP of Brazil and being responsible for 15% of all scientific research of the country. The city is home to State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), considered (QS Ranking 2012) the second best university of the country and the third best of Latin America.\nFor a visitor, besides the obvious business/academic opportunities, Campinas offers the shopping, gastronomy and nightlife typical of a large city, but with ease of access to the beautiful landscape and the scenic towns of the Mantiqueira mountain range. Campinas also hosts a considerable historical heritage from the late 19th century, associated with the prosperity of coffee farming during this period.\n\n\nDistricts\n\nThe main district of Campinas contains two high-rise areas: Downtown, the oldest part of the city and main shopping area and transport hub, and just next to it, Cambu\u00ed, an affluent neighborhood with several restaurants, bars and hotels. The rest of the main district is mostly composed of low-rise suburbs of different social profiles, with points of interest relatively spread.\nSousas and Joaquim Eg\u00eddio, adjacent to each other, offer lots of nature and a charming historic center. Several gated communities have also popped up in this area.\nBar\u00e3o Geraldo is the district that contains UNICAMP, plus several companies and research centers. It is basically a collection of calm suburbs, but with good infrastructure of commerce and services, and a substantial number of restaurants and bars.\nNova Aparecida is a more industrial/suburban district and should not be of interest to a visitor.\n\n\nUnderstand\nCampinas is certainly not a main tourism destination, attracting more business travellers, international students and research visitors than conventional tourists. It offers however a number of interesting things to do for the casual visitor, such as exploring the city's coffee farming heritage and its lively nightlife.\n\n\nHistory\n\nCampinas started as a simple outpost for Portuguese settlers on 1774. It became a municipality on 1797, with the name of Vila de S\u00e3o Carlos. The city grew and prospered in subsequent decades with sugarcane farming, followed by coffee farming by the end of 19th century. After the decline of the coffee farming, Campinas started to re-emerge after the 1930s by means of industry development and more diversified exported-oriented agriculture. It eventually became the center of Brazil's major important industrial areas, which includes nearby municipalities such as Paul\u00ednia, Americana and Valinhos, collectively forming the Campinas metropolitan area. The creation of State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in 1966, also resulted in the city becoming one of the country's most important centers of research and technology, hosting several research institutes and technology startup companies.\n\n\nCulture\nCampinas' culture can be described as a mix of the urban, cosmopolitan S\u00e3o Paulo city and the rural, caipira culture of the countryside of the S\u00e3o Paulo's state. The city's many bars and clubs play international pop music as much as sertanejo music. Demographically speaking, Campinas is similar to S\u00e3o Paulo, with a strong Portuguese and Italian heritage as well as a sizeable population of descendants of Japanese as well as migrants from the Northeast of Brazil.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nCampinas has its own an international airport, but many international and domestic visitors arrive from S\u00e3o Paulo's airports.\n\n\nBy Viracopos International Airport\n1   Viracopos International Airport (VCP  IATA).   (updated Dec 2021) Viracopos Airport is one of the main airports in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo and the main hub of the airline Azul Brazilian Airlines. It has flights to Fort Lauderdale, Lisbon and Orlando, and seasonal flights to Punta del Este.\nTo arrive from the airport to the city, one can use the following options:\n\n Taxi. Taxi prices from the airport are either by meter or by fixed price according to the destination. Fixed prices are not mandatory - taxi users have always the option of choosing to use the meter, but generally there is not much difference between both. By fixed price, as of Oct 2015, a trip to UNICAMP would cost R$ 141 (flag 1) or R$ 181 (flag 2). To the intercity bus terminal , R$ 81 (flag 1) or R$ 103 (flag 2). The full list of destinations can be found in the EMDEC website. \n Local bus. Every 30 min, from 06:10 to 00:08. The cheapest option. Line 193, that has a 30 minutes time delay and cost R$4,50, this line stops at the main Campinas streets and at the main local bus station, from which you can get buses to other points of the city and to other local bus stations without extra cost. R$4,50, to be paid on board. \n  Lirabus Shuttle Bus, \u260f +55 19 3234-1000. Every hour. The shuttle bus operated by LiraBus is a cheap option and good if you have luggage. It stops at Largo do Par\u00e1 Square (city center) and at the intercity bus station, where you can get a bus to other Brazilian cities or a taxi. One way R$9. \n Rent a car. There are two car rentals at the airport and the prices for economy class cars are close to R$70 a day. \n\n\nBy Guarulhos/Congonhas airports\nThe airports of Guarulhos and Congonhas are both about 1:40 minutes away by car. Cab trips are somewhat pricey but you can take a shuttle from Lirabus   that goes directly to Campinas and take about 2 hours. It costs R$40 from Guarulhos, R$35 from Congonhas, and will leave you at Largo do Par\u00e1 Square, one block from Hotel Ibis, or at Terminal Multimodal Ramos de Azevedo (Rodovi\u00e1ria). From there you can get buses or taxis to other points of the city.\nA far less attractive option is to use the Airport Bus Service from EMTU [1] that goes to Terminal Rodovi\u00e1rio Barra Funda and stop at Terminal Rodovi\u00e1rio Tiet\u00ea, where you have to take an intercity bus to Campinas. This option is both more expensive and takes a longer time (about 3 hours) than the LiraBus direct bus, so it would typically only be used in an emergency.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom S\u00e3o Paulo, via the SP-330 Anhang\u00fcera or SP-348 Bandeirantes highways.\nFrom Vale do Para\u00edba, via SP-65, Dom Pedro I highway.\nFrom the Macro region of Mogi-gua\u00e7u, via SP-340, Adhemar de Barros Highway.\nFrom South (Valinhos and Vinhedo), via SP-91 (Campinas - Valinhos)\nFrom the Macro region of Sorocaba, via SP-75, Santos Dumont Highway)\nFrom the Monte-mor, via SP-101 (Campinas - Monte-mor)\nFrom Valinhos, via SP-83, Anel Vi\u00e1rio Magalh\u00e3es Teixeira\nFrom Indaiatuba, via SP-73, Lix da Cunha Highway (access for the Royal Palm Plaza)\nFrom Morungaba, via SP-81, Estrada das Cabras\nFrom Vinhedo, via SP-324, Miguel Melhado Campos Highway\nFrom Paul\u00ednia/Arthur Nogueira, via SP-332, General Milton Tavares de Souza Highway\n\n\nBy bus\n\nBuses to Campinas arrive at Terminal Multimodal Ramos de Azevedo (Rua Dr. Pereira Lima - Centro), in (Botafogo). Bus tickets can even be reserved and purchased by Internet for the main bus companies. You would need to check on the bus station which company serves to a certain destination in particular.\nBuses from S\u00e3o Paulo are however quite frequent (4-5 departures per hour) and reserving in advance is seldom necessary. The two companies that operate buses from S\u00e3o Paulo are Via\u00e7\u00e3o Cometa and Lirabus . The ticket costs R$25 and the trip takes about 1 hr 20 min (often more because of traffic in S\u00e3o Paulo).\nHowever, do not use such buses if you just want to get to the Viracopos airport (there are buses from S\u00e3o Paulo that go directly to the airport).\n\n2 Multimodal Terminal Ramos de Azevedo (Terminal Multimodal Ramos de Azevedo), R. Dr. Pereira Lima, 85.  (updated Aug 2020)\n\n\nBy train\nThe only passenger train operating in Campinas is the weekend touristic ride to and from Jaguari\u00fana (see #Do section). At some point in the future, Campinas is expected to be linked by high speed train to S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and by commuter train to S\u00e3o Paulo and Jundia\u00ed.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nDowntown Campinas, containing most of the city's shopping and historical buildings, is a relatively large area but still easier to be explored on foot, given the large amount of traffic. The center of Sousas/Joaquim Eg\u00eddio is also an excellent area to walk.\nOther areas of Campinas don't offer much in terms of sightseeing, but calm, green suburbs like Parque Taquaral, Nova Campinas, and Cidade Universit\u00e1ria (in Bar\u00e3o Geraldo), can offer a nice leisurely stroll.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nCampinas has a very limited network of cycleways; there is for instance one that links the center of the Bar\u00e3o Geraldo district with the UNICAMP, and another surrounding Parque Portugal. It is better to cycle in calmer suburbs, with small amount of traffic. Cycling is a popular means of transport for the students of UNICAMP.\n\n\nBy bus\nDespite being a city with more than 1 million inhabitants, Campinas does not have any mass rapid transit system, although a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is under implementation. Buses are hence the only option of public transport; check the EMDEC company website for routes and itineraries.\nAs with most large Brazilian cities, buses are confusing, and can be overcrowded and slow (as they often get stuck in traffic), but they are relatively frequent and reach practically everywhere.\nAlthough it is not easy to find where are the bus stops and which bus to catch, people on the street will be glad to help if they can understand you. There are several main bus terminals, where you can transfer from one line into another. Some urban buses even go to neighbor cities as Jaguari\u00fana and Paul\u00ednia.\nCampinas has adopted a prepaid smartcard for paying buses, the Bilhete \u00danico, that allows you to take multiple buses in a 2-hour period paying only a single tariff (R$3,30 as of May 2013). A visitor can obtain a Bilhete \u00danico for free in the main bus terminals, by bringing an identity document and charging as little as R$9,00 (two tariffs).\n\n1 Central bus terminal (Terminal Central). The central bus terminal, most local and regional routes stop here. (updated Aug 2020)\n\n\nBy car\nIf driving a car, be aware that some avenues have been converted to one-way streets to form a ring around downtown. Sometimes it can be tricky to find your way back and be careful not to get into the wrong way on one of those avenues.\nAfter 22:00 until 06:00, some traffic lights are turned off and just blink yellow. Don't be scared, this is not effect of a Martian invasion. For safety reasons, you are not supposed to be stopped at red lights late at night.\nBe aware, however, that during normal hours red lights and speed are enforced by cameras everywhere in the city, so stick to the speed limits and don't cross red lights.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDowntown\n\nLike many others large Brazilian cities, Campinas' Downtown suffers from urban degradation. However, it contains several buildings of historical and architectural value, many associated with S\u00e3o Paulo state's glorious coffee farming era between the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n1 Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of the Conception (Catedral Metropolitana de Campinas), Pra\u00e7a Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio, \u260f +55 19 3231-2085.

Even if you are not interested in mineral springs, it is still worth a visit as it is a scenic area with cozy and charming towns, offering also options for radical sports and ecotourism.\n\n\u00c1guas de Lind\u00f3ia \u2013 90 km. One of the most popular mineral spring towns of the state\nAmparo \u2013 70 km. The largest city of the Water Circuit, with an impressive XIX century heritage\nJaguari\u00fana \u2013 30 km.

Tranquil mineral spring town\nHolambra - 40 km \u2013 The Brazilian \"Little Netherlands\", famous for its annual floral exposition\n\n\nBuy\n\n Downtown. Downtown Campinas is the main shopping area of the city, and you probably can find cheaper products here than in the suburbs or shopping malls. A good place to start your shopping is the pedestrianized Rua Treze de Maio (where the Catedral Metropolitana sits), that contains all major chain stores like C&A, Pernambucanas and Americanas. Downtown streets shops are typically open M-F 08:00-19:00, Sa 08:00-17:00. During December, before Christmas, working hours are generally extended. \n Central Market (Mercad\u00e3o), Av. Benjamim Constant, Pra\u00e7a Carlos Botelho - Centro, \u260f +55 19 3232-3679. Nice place to find exotic food and to feel the charm that Campinas had in its past. It is downtown close to two main bus stations, which takes some of this beauty away but makes the local easily accessible. It is a great spot for people watching. \n Hippie Fair (Feira Hippie), Pra\u00e7a Imprensa Fluminense, no number - Cambu\u00ed (at Centro de Conviv\u00eancia), \u260f +55 19 3232-4168. Sa Su 09:00-14:00. The art crafts fair now is officially called \"Feira de Arte, Artesanato, Antiguidades, Esot\u00e9ricos e Quitutes de Campinas\" but with such a long name, all the locals still call it by its old and more charming name: Feira Hippie. The fair started in the 1970s and since then a lot has changed: its location, size, and products, and today actual hippie vendors are rare. This is a must-do in Campinas. It is possible to buy all kinds of arts and crafts: paintings, jewellery, clothes, house articles, shoes, bags, etc. The food section is an amazing trip through local and Brazilian cuisine: pasteis (fried dumplings), empanadas, and pies share space with regional food and as well as dishes brought by immigrants and fully adopted by the Brazilians, such as yakisoba and sushi. \n\n\nShopping malls\n\nLike any decent-sized city in Brazil, there are a number of American-style shopping malls, typically including a food court, movie theater, and a variety of shops.\n\n Campinas Shopping, intersection of the Anhanguera and Santos Dumont Highways, \u260f +55 19 3727-2300.

With 37 shops. \n\n Shopping Parque D. Pedro, Av. Guilherme Campos, 500 - Jardim Santa Genebra, \u260f +55 19 3756-7500. M-Sa 10:00-22:00, Su 12:00-22:00 (Food Court stays open an hour later). A very popular mall, not only for Campinas's citizens but for the whole region- tour buses arriving with visitors from neighboring cities is not uncommon. You can find pretty much anything you need in the almost 400 stores, but come prepared to walk. There are around 40 options of places to eat, 15 movie screens, bowling alley, gym and night clubs. If you are not inclined to crowds, try to avoid visiting it during weekends and holidays. Kids love this mall, where they can play in the themed resting places. The area where the mall was constructed was part of the Santa Genebra forest and some of the centenary trees that were cut down or found dead during construction were preserved through chemical processes and are now exhibited inside the mall. It is routine to see people taking pictures with the dead trees as background since the artist who worked on them really did an amazing job. \n Shopping Unimart, Avenida John Boyd Dunlop, 350 - Jardim Aur\u00e9lia, \u260f +55 19 3241-1071. Shopping mall of more modest size, located not far from the city center. With 133 shops. \n Parque das Bandeiras Shopping, Av. John Boyd Dunlop, 3900, \u260f +55 19 3728-4000. M-Sa 10:00-22:00, Su 12:00-22:00. The newest shopping mall of Campinas, the first constructed in the populous Southwest suburbs. With 280 shops. \n\n\nEat\n\nWhile, like most of the state, Campinas has the fairly typical paulistano range of Italian, Japanese, Middle Eastern, and standard Brazilian food, it doesn't have anything much that might be called campineiro food. The two most notable things might be the local penchant for arugula salad (salada de r\u00facula) and the local lancherias' habit of serving their sandwiches cut into bite size pieces, dubbed the \"angel-mouth cut\" (corte boca-de-anjo). Among desserts, you should not miss the torta holandesa (Dutch pie) which, despite its name, was invented in Campinas.\n\n\nMain district\n Almanara, Av. Iguatemi, 777 (in Shopping Iguatemi, 3rd floor), \u260f +55 19 3255-0477.

Be sure to ask for the \"Parmegiana\" the most famous dish in the house: deep fried breaded beef, taken to the oven covered with cheese and tomato sauce, served with rice and french fries. \n  Chef Theo, Rua Sampaio Ferraz, 175 - Cambu\u00ed, \u260f +55 19 3255-4333. \n Kilimanjaro Galleria, Rodovia Dom Pedro I, km 131.5 (in Galleria Shopping, 1st floor), \u260f +55 19 3207-3332. \n Kilimanjaro Iguatemi, Av.

Maria Tereza Dias da Silva, 664 (Estrada da Rhodia), \u260f +55 19 3289-6400. Hamburguer restaurant. \n\n\nDrink\nWhile in terms of cultural options, Campinas is not quite what you expect from a metropolis, its nightlife will surely not disappoint you. Cambu\u00ed is the \"city center\" of bohemian life, but good bars can be found everywhere, Bar\u00e3o Geraldo including.

During the day, most of the city is considerably safe - exceptions are the \"Crackland\" area in the Botafogo neighborhood (Downtown) and some lower class suburbs. Fortunately, the intercity bus terminal has been moved from Botafogo, so there is no need anymore for a visitor to wander this area.\nThe Downtown area is not safe during the night and should be avoided. Cambu\u00ed and most affluent suburbs are relatively safe during the night, but take a cab or drive yourself if you have to walk anything more than a few blocks. If you just want to fool around during the evening, a safer bet is to go to one of the city's shopping malls.\nThe districts of Bar\u00e3o Geraldo, Sousas and Joaquim Eg\u00eddio are safer than the main district, but crime does happen and staying alert to your surroundings during the night is always a good idea.\n\n\nGo Next\nYou find hostels and private rooms in ...:\n\n\nin the east:\nBragan\u00e7a Paulista \u2013 65 km.

Attractions of the city include a charming riverside area, historical heritage and Tyrolese villages. You can do boat trips on the river.\nBoituva \u2013 110 km. The \"National Skydive Capital\". It's also known for ballooning.\nBotucatu \u2013 220 km. It is known as the Land of Adventure. There are more than 70 waterfalls in its region, some with easy access, others with extreme difficulty. For those who enjoy extreme sports, this is the right place to venture out.\nBauru \u2013 260 km. The city is the hometown of Marcos C\u00e9sar Pontes, the first Brazilian in space. It is also the town where Pel\u00e9 grew up and learned his football skills.\n\n\nin the south:\nS\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 The cosmopolitan state capital, with endless options of gastronomy and culture, is easily accessible from Campinas by bus",
