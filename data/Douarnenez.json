  "extract": "Douarnenez is a port town in Finist\u00e8re, Brittany, France.\n\n\nUnderstand\nDouarnenez is historically a sardine-fishing and canning town. Today, fishing has slowed, and tourism is instead a focus.\nThe locals are often very friendly and will happily start a conversation with strangers.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses come in from Quimper every day, BreizhGo line 51. The 1 bus terminal is in the city centre.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Quimper, Douarnenez is half an hour away via the D765. It is signposted the whole way.\nFrom Brest, it is about 1h30 away. Either take the N165 towards Quimper until exit 60 (sign says Douarnenez), and follow the signs; or take the N165 all the way to Quimper, get off at exit 56, and follow the signs.\n\n\nBy train\nThe train station in Douarnenez was closed in the 1970s. The closest train station is in Quimper.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy foot\nThe town is not large and can be walked about with ease. Some streets can be very steep though, watch out for those if you are out of shape.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere is a bus service. \n\n\nBy car\nEasy to park. Watch out if you're driving a large car, streets in the city centre can be very narrow!\n\n\nSee\n1 The Harbour Museum (Le Port Mus\u00e9e).  \n2 Tristan Island (L'\u00cele Tristan). A small island just 200 metres off the coast. It gave its name to the town: Douar an enez, meaning \"Land of the island\" in Breton. When the tide is low, a dune appears connecting the island and the mainland. It is closed to visitors most of the year but opens up for a few days every year.   \n3 Plomarc'h Farm (La ferme des Plomarc'h). \n\n\nDo\n Festival du cin\u00e9ma. Usually the last week of August. A yearly film festival with a focus on promoting and featuring marginalised cultures. (updated Oct 2019)\nFor a spiritual experience, try walking up 1 Rue Monte au ciel (Ascend to heaven street). Then, you could try walking down to 2 Place de l'Enfer (Hell Square).\n\n\nBuy\n.\n\n\nEat\n1 Au Go\u00fbter Breton, 36 rue Jean Jaur\u00e8s. A cr\u00eaperie with a delightfully decorated interior. Very popular. (updated Oct 2019)\n2 Le Bigorneau Amoureux (on the waterfront at the end of the Port-Rhu). (updated Oct 2019)\n\n\nDrink\nLike many ports of the region,  Le Port du Rosmeur is peppered with bars and brasseries.\n\n\nSleep\n G\u00eetes des Plomarc'h, \u260f +33 2-98-92-75-41. \n\n\nConnect\n.\n\n\nGo next\nQuimper\nLocronan",
