  "extract": "Foz do Igua\u00e7u is a major city in the Cascavel region, Brazil. It is a gateway to Paraguay and Argentina, and home of the famous Igua\u00e7u Falls. Together with the cities of Ciudad del Este (Paraguay) and Puerto Iguazu (Argentina), it forms part of one of the largest cultural tourism areas in South America.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nFoz do Igua\u00e7u sits at the mouth of the Igua\u00e7u river, discharging into Paran\u00e1 river, near the borders of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. The word Igua\u00e7u means \"large water\", in Tupi-Guarani. Despite hosting one of Brazil's major tourist attractions, the city has a rather un-touristy feel, and other than the large number of hotels and occasional tri-lingual signs, it looks like any other medium-sized Brazilian city - there are practically no \"tourist shopping streets\" and like. There is however a large shopping mall being constructed at Avenida das Cataratas, to provide additional convenience to visitors in terms of night-time shopping and gastronomy.\nIn the past, Foz do Igua\u00e7u formed with a tourism pole together with the nearby city of Gua\u00edra, which hosted the Gua\u00edra Falls (Sete Quedas). After the construction of the gigantic Itaipu Dam in the early 1980s, the Gua\u00edra Falls were inundated, leaving Foz do Igua\u00e7u as the only major traveller destination in the southwestern border of the Paran\u00e1 state.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Iguazu Falls Cataratas International Airport (IGU  IATA). Close to the city. There are frequent flights from Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Santiago, etc. ATMs are available on the ground level next to Arrivals. Internet terminals and WiFi are available in the upstairs restaurant area but the WiFi can only be purchased in a 24 hour package for R$25 which is quite expensive.When flying out of Foz do Igua\u00e7u, if you're going to Rio de Janeiro, request a window seat on the right side of the plane\u2014don't miss the views!   (updated Jun 2018)\nDirect flights are available to Foz do Igua\u00e7u/Cataratas International Airport from the following cities\n\n  '    Rio de Janeiro Gale\u00e3o' International Airport with a travel time of 1 hr 55in m\n'S\u00e3o Paulo Guarulhos Inter'national Airport with a travel time of 1 hr 50 min \n\n\nBy bus\n2 International Bus Station (Rodovi\u00e1ria Internacional) (northeast of the center). Most connections and bus companies go from/to this bus station. (updated Jun 2018)\nBus transportation is available to and from the most important cities in the country, and even to Argentina:\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 About 15 hr, with at least three daily connections between both cities in the early and late afternoon, R$230-260.\nRio de Janeiro \u2013 About 25 hr, with connections in the morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon, around R$300.\nCuritiba \u2013 About 11 hr, early and late connections with Catarinense, R$190-240.\nCuiaba \u2013 About 28 hr with Eucatur.\nCampo Grande \u2013 About 14 hr with Medianeira, Integra\u00e7\u00e3o or Unesul.\nBelo Horizonte \u2013 About 32 hr, one connection per day, R$380.\nFlorianopolis \u2013 Several late afternoon and evening connections, R$170-350.\nSantos \u2013 With at least one daily connection.\nBonito\nBuenos Aires \u2013 With at least three departures weekly from Igua\u00e7u on Sundays at 13:30, and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 17:00.\n\n\nBy freight bus company\nThe two companies below transport goods and passengers to S\u00e3o Paulo for merchants buying in Ciudad del Este, what makes them so cheap but a little chaotic and different at the same time. They take a while with the boarding, which is also why there is always a restaurant nearby, which they probably own. Also, the journey includes a 30-min stop at a restaurant just 4 hr after leaving Foz do Igua\u00e7u. Furthermore, the bus might be checked a little closer by police, but as a regular tourist that is nothing of your concern, because you do not carry any taxable goods. You and your luggage will also be checked by the bus company for any tradable goods. So, if you have anything still packaged and in uncommon amounts, this might be a problem. As of May 2018, the journey time is 15\u00bd hr, of which 2\u00bd hr are being stuck in S\u00e3o Paulo traffic. Entry and exit points are their local offices. The buses seats are semi-cama. It is probably a good idea to call ahead for reservation or availability of seats, or ask your ho(s)tel.\n\n3 Trans Muleke, Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Rua Assis 124, \u260f +55 4535250606, +55 999993461. 17-18:00 to/from Sao Paulo, but you should get your ticket already at 15:00 or the day before. R$130. (updated Jun 2018)\n4 MD Tour, Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Av. Carlos Gomes 564, \u260f +55 4599636188, +55 4535223186, +55 45999644579. 17-18:00 to/from Sao Paulo, but you should get your ticket already at 15:00 or the day before. R$130. (updated Jun 2018)\nAs with all bus companies, always keep an eye on your luggage\u2014drug smuggling is not unheard of in Brazil. Some people say these buses are smuggler buses, because some people do not pay import taxes on their goods, but this is none of your concern.\n\n\nBy tour company\nIn Igua\u00e7u you can find many tour companies that make the trip from/to Paraguay, Argentina or any other point of interest.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Curitiba, access is over the BR-227 (Curitiba - Asuncion) highway. There are 632 km of highway. Foz do Igua\u00e7u is in the extreme west of Paran\u00e1, 640 km from Curitiba.\nMain highways:\n\nFrom Curitiba: BR-277\nFrom S\u00e3o Paulo: BR-116/BR-277\nFrom Rio de Janeiro: BR-116/BR277\n\n\nGet around\n\nYou can cross the international borders to Paraguay and Argentina by public bus, taxi, car, tour car, moto-taxi, or foot. Non-car options are better because you can skip a large part of the line at immigration on both sides. Waits of 1-2 hours are common for cars.\n\n\nBy bus\nFozTrans operates most local buses. Schedules are here, but expect delays. The cash fare is R$5 each ride. Links to route maps are at the bottom of each schedule PDF. Fare is free for those ages 60 and over: show your ID to the bus driver then board through the rear. The official website is not very functional when it is offline so the best alternative is to check the bus route and schedule on the website.\nBus 120 is the most convenient connection, running from the TTU (city center urban transport bus station), through the city center, to the airport, the bird park, and finally the national park.\nThe airport is 15 km south of the city center and 3 km northwest of the national park.\nThe airport bus stop is a short 20 m outside the main entrance (to your left when exiting the terminal).\nAt the airport, be sure to ask the driver so you know which direction the 120 bus is going, as it stops two times at the airport - one time on its route to the bird park and then visitor's center in the park, and then again while returning back from the park to the city center.\nBy bus, the park visitor's center is 10 minutes from the airport, while the city center is 40-60 min, depending on traffic.\nCiudad del Este, Paraguay is across the western Paran\u00e1 River via the Friendship Bridge.\nPuerto Iguazu, Argentina is across the southern Rio Igua\u00e7u.\nRio Uruguay (officially Transporte Tr\u00eas Fronteiras SA) departs from a stop on the northwest corner on the street immediately north of the TTU on the Brazilian side. Google Maps\nDon\u2019t forget your passport or Mercosul ID.\nThe fare is 700 Argentinian pesos or R$15 Brazilian reais each way as of January 2023.\nPaying in pesos is usually better; ask around and lots of commercial folk around the borders like the bus driver or news stands will exchange (\u201cc\u00e2mbio\u201d) currency or point you to an exchange.\nFirst departure 6:30am, last departure 6:30pm, 45 minute ride.\nBuses depart the TTU every hour on the half hour to the \u201cTerminal [de Buses de] Puerto Iguaz\u00fa\u201d (Google Maps) on the Argentinian side, where you can take another paid bus transfer to the falls.\nThe bus will stop multiple times, including an optional stop at Brazilian immigration (you can skip it if you will return and don\u2019t feel strongly about an outgoing stamp) and a mandatory stop at the Argentinian immigration (\u201cmigraci\u00f3nes\u201d).\nBuses return from Terminal Puerto Iguaz\u00fa also every hour on the half hour. First return 7:30am, last return 6:30pm.\nAlways check with the driver for seasonal changes to schedule.\n\n\nBy rideshare\nPrices vary. As of January 2023, expect:\n\nR$10\u201315 for 10 minute rides within the city center\nR$45\u201365 for 45 minute rides between the city center and the airport or parks. These rides can be hard to find because local companies discourage ride share drivers from waiting near these destinations.\nTo get the best price and maximize your chances of getting a ride, use multiple apps:\n\nUber is available but is not the most popular or cheapest app. Drivers may message you asking to pay out-of-app in cash; this is normal. Say \u201cCombinado\u201d to accept. Say \u201cN\u00e3o d\u00e1\u201d to reject. Either way, say \u201cFavor cancelar no app\u201d to ask them to cancel the ride so you can stop or continue your ride search without Uber cancellation fees.\nR\u00e1pidocar (iOS, Android) is the most popular local rideshare app. It is best for travel within the city center. You may have to change your App Store region to Brazil to download it.\n99 (iOS, Android) [pronounced no-VEIN-ta EE no-VEE] is a national rideshare app that is also popular locally.\n\n\nBy taxi\nCoopert\u00e1xi Cataratas taxi stands are widely available at most tourist destinations. You can also hail them using their Android app. Ask if they accept credit cards (\"Aceita cart\u00e3o?\").\nAs of April 2022, fares are at most R$5.10 + R$4.62/kilometer. Expect around R$75 between the city center and the airport or Brazilian falls. Trips exiting the city have different rates.\n\n\nSee\n1 Igua\u00e7u Falls (Cataratas do Igua\u00e7u) (Bus 120), \u260f +55 45 3521 4400. Ticket booth 8AM-4PM daily, last return shuttle bus 5:30PM. One of the most famous attractions in Brazil, the falls on the Igua\u00e7u River have a flow capacity equal to three times that of Niagara Falls. The falls are shared between Brazil and Argentina, and each side has its own network of trails and viewpoints. The National Park on the Brazilian side runs a shuttle bus between the Visitors' Centre, the falls, and numerous outdoor tour operators, including boat rides run by Macuco Safari out to the bottom of the falls. Luggage lockers available (+R$20/day). You can buy your ticket onsite with a ticket vending machine, or online. Your ticket comes with an entry time (and date). If there're much people, expect to wait 30 min just to buy the ticket. Then even if you've bought the ticket onsite, you might need to wait another 2-4 hours, depending on the entry time you get (maybe buy online in advance, then you know at least your entrance time). Expect at least another hour queuing up for the actual entrance and shuttle buses, if the queue already starts outside the building in the tents. On the way back, expect another 30 min queuing time for the shuttle bus on very busy days. R$100.   (updated Sep 2023)\n\n2 Parque das Aves (Birds Park) (Bus 120), \u260f +55 (45) 3529-8282 (WhatsApp), atendimento@parquedasaves.com.br. Ticket booth 8:30AM-4:30PM. It is very close to the entrance of the falls, you can take a self-guided tour of the park to come in close contact with all different types of exotic birds. There may also be chances to hold and take pictures with the birds. The Birds Park is considered an ecological sanctuary. It is located near the Igua\u00e7u National Park in a 16-hectare area of native woods. A paved trail leads visitors to the enormous aviaries that blend in with the forest and allow you to know approximately 900 birds from 180 species. The Park also has a butterfly section with 25 species and a reptile section as well. All of these animals can be seen from a distance of only a few meters. The park also has luggage lockers (+R$10), a parking lot, a souvenir shop and a snack bar. R$80.   (updated Jan 2023)\n3 Itaipu Dam (Itaipu Binacional) (Bus 101/102), \u260f +55 45 3576-7000, info@turismoitaipu.com.br. Panoramic bus: 8:30AM-5PM, every 20 minutes. The Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant is the largest electric power generator in the world and was considered to be one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineering. Booking in advance is recommended for special tour and/or on weekends/public holidays. There are many tourism attractions available, but the panoramic tour and of the dam is a must. Panoramic bus R$56. Special/Engineering R$160. Zoo R$40. Night R$48. Bike access R$50.   (updated Jan 2023)\nIf you are keen to save some money, head over to the Paraguayan side of the dam. They offer the same tours for free, some requiring registration one week ahead, but some days might work as well if it is not high season. Take the border bus (R$5.50) to Ciudad del Este center and the nearby 5 Terminal bus urbano, from where the bus to Hernandarias and Itaipu is going. You will probably need to change some money into guaranis for the bus to and from the dam. Use the exchange opportunities explained for Ciudad del Este. Also, read more on how to get to the dam under the Ciudad del Este article.\n4 Three Borders Landmark (Argentina\u2013Brazil\u2013Paraguay tripoint) (Bus 110). 13:30-21:00 (Tuesday - Sunday). The place where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet. Each side has its own Marco (landmark). Have a look at Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, all in the same glimpse of the eye while there are cargo freighters making their way slowly along the water. Bus line 110 leaving from the Downtown Terminal whose final destination is the landmark. There is a new visitor center and a museum on the Brazilian side. It has a wall around it, so you cannot see the Brazilian border mark without paying. It's now a tourist attraction with live shows in the evening.Argentinian border mark is easily accessible even by walk from the center, or by bus. Paraguayan mark is quite far from the city, accessible by buses from the centre (Av. General Bernardino Caballero), take a bus labelled Tres Fronteras (destination, not the company name) and ask for La Balsa (the ferry), ask to get out in front of the huge gate. Argentina: Free, Brazil: R$49, Paraguay: free.   (updated Jan 2024)\n5 Paraguay Border Market (take the border bus for R$5.50). The border markets close very early at around 16:00 in local winter and 17:00 in local summer, right before sunset. Shopping is the main business of the visitors. The main shopping streets are San Blas and Camilo Recalde, where you can buy almost anything. Many people come for electronics. Otherwise, get some Paraguayan Chipa and/or exchange your dollars here. You probably do not need to get your passport stamped if you return to Brazil afterwards, as long as you have a valid visa for Brazil. (updated Mar 2019)\n\n\nDo\n Salto do Macuco (Tinamou Drop) (Macuco Saf\u00e1ri) (Inside Igua\u00e7u Park). 9AM-5PM. On this tour, the visitor takes trails in an open, electric vehicle, accompanied by trilingual guides over 3 km of jungle. The vehicle stops at the beginning of a 600-m trail that leads to the Salto do Macuco \u2013 with its crystal clear waters that fall from a height of 20 m over rocks, forming a tiny lake. Those who do not want to descend on foot can take the same electric car to where they embark on the inflatable boat. It is an exciting adventure as the boat navigates over a canyon\u2019s waters and gets very near the huge Garganta do Diabo falls and then receives the \u201cwet blessing\u201d from the Three Musketeers Falls. To get there take the Cataratas Highway to km 23, already inside the Igua\u00e7u National Park. A hint: if you don\u2019t want to get soaked, take a raincoat. R$362 + park entrance. (updated Jan 2023)\n Helicopter Tour. 09:00-17:00. This 10-minute tour provides a beautiful aerial view of Igua\u00e7u National Park. It is the best way to understand the real dimensions of the Falls. Another option is to fly over the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant. For the flight over the Iguacu falls, you need a minimum of 3 people (the helicopter can take 7 people + the pilot), but you can wait around and will usually find another group of one or two people. R$435. (updated Apr 2017)\n Po\u00e7o Preto (Black Well). This excursion is made in a special vehicle \u2013 over a rustic 18 km trail - through the exuberant vegetation of the National Park.

It is located on km 18 of BR 469 \u2013 the Cataratas Highway. \n\n\nBuy\nFoz do Igua\u00e7u is not a shopping destination. Brazilians generally go to the neighbouring cities of Ciudad del Este in Paraguay for cheaper imported goods, or to Puerto Iguazu in Argentina for Argentinean wines and alfajor.\n\n Downtown. Downtown shopping is mostly found at Av. Brasil (between Av. Jorge Schimmelpfeng and Av. Rep\u00fablica Argentina) and its surroundings. Shops there are mostly aimed at locals, not tourists, and do not open on evenings or Sundays. \n Cataratas JL Shopping, Av. Costa e Silva, 185 - P\u00f3lo Centro. 11:00-23:00. A typical Brazilian-style shopping mall which offers the conveniences of late evening shopping and a decent food court. Contains a branch of the Brazilian department store Havan. The mall is definitely not tourist-oriented, but has trilingual signs. 113 shops. \n\n\nMoney\nChanging money in Ciudad del Este is considerably cheaper than in Foz, even when getting Brazilian Real. The bus ticket to Ciudad del Este is just R$5.50 one-way. See article: Ciudad del Este#Money.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nBudget\n1 Star Restaurante, R. Rui Barbosa, 1032 - Sala 64.

Fancy rooms, gourmet dining rooms, outdoor pool and tennis place. 203 rooms.   \n\n\nStay safe\nCrimes have happened to pedestrians walking across the Friendship Bridge. Tourists with cash and shopping products attracts criminals, and an attack is particularly easy because the walkway on both sides is narrow and enclosed by metal fencing on both sides, making escape impossible. One common attack is a group of 2-4 men with pistols who encircle groups of walkers, stealing all wallets, phones, and merchandise. Generally, the criminals throw their booty into bags and then leave towards the Paraguayan side (supposedly they bribe the Paraguayan police to allow them to pass unobstructed). Moto-taxis also participated in the attacks in 2018. Although there are border agents and police on both sides of the bridge, the bridge has no security, which further exacerbates the risk. Attacks in September 2018 were featured on TV news because of the severity. Despite the risk, many people, particularly daily commuters who work on both sides, still prefer to walk across the bridge in order to avoid the traffic jams and the expense of the bus. Realistically, the odds of being attacked if you walk across during the day are low, but it's important to be very cautious because attacks can and do happen every month. If you're at all concerned, hide your valuables, do not walk in groups but with locals, or simply take the bus.\n\n\nGo next\nIgua\u00e7u Falls \u2013 Obviously the most important attraction nearby Foz do Igua\u00e7u. The world-famous falls.\nPuerto Iguazu \u2013 On the Argentinian side of the border, offers access to the Argentinian side of the falls and a number of casinos and shopping. Buses go from behind of Local Bus Terminal every 30-60 minutes and costs R$4. If you are staying for longer than a day you need to get off at each border and pass through immigration. Bus will not wait for you, so you will have to wait for the next bus, that you can board with the original ticket. As it is not far and buses do not go often, walking may be faster.\nCiudad del Este \u2013 On the Paraguay side of the border, it is a rather chaotic mid-size town that serves as a shopping destination for Brazilians and Argentinians looking for low-tax imported goods.\nSome taxis will take you to Puerto Iguazu and wait for you to pass through the two customs but are quite expensive. For example, taking the taxi only to the Argentinian border from Foz de Iguacu costs around R$40. You need to agree with the driver on a price before boarding as they don't want to use the meter for these sort of trips.",
