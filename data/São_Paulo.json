  "extract": "S\u00e3o Paulo, or Sampa as it is also called, is the largest city in Brazil, with a municipality population of 12.1 million, and about 21.3 million in its metropolitan region - the most populous of the Americas and the Southern Hemisphere. It is the capital of the Southeastern state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and also a beehive of activity that offers a jovial nightlife and an intense cultural experience.\nS\u00e3o Paulo is South America's major economic center and possesses the 10th largest GDP in the world, though poverty, especially in the suburbs, is still widespread due to the blatant social inequality. Historically attractive to immigrants and to Brazilians from other states, it has a unique cultural identity formed by combining Portuguese and African roots (common to the entire country) with other influences, in particular Italian, Arab and Japanese.\nS\u00e3o Paulo is probably one of the most underrated cities tourism-wise, often overshadowed by other places in the Brazilian sun & beach circuit such as Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. It is in fact a great city to explore, with an impressive (and almost intimidating) skyline, unpredictable neighbourhoods and architecture, a vibrant culture and arts (in particular street art) scene, not to mention the world-class restaurants and diverse regional and international cuisine available to all tastes. If there is a major attraction to this city, it is the excellent quality of its restaurants and the variety of cultural activities on display.\nJust south of the city lies the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar (part of the Atlantic Forest South-East Reserves, a UNESCO World Heritage Site), a mountain range covered by lush rainforest that faces the coast and provides various ecotourism options.\n\n\nSubdivisions\n\n\nUnderstand\nS\u00e3o Paulo is the most visited city of Brazil, but mostly because of business and event tourism, with many of the visitors not taking much effort to explore the city. Those who do so may, however, discover one of\nthe most complex and fascinating cities of the world, where even nearby areas may look and feel like a different city, due to S\u00e3o Paulo's staggering social inequality and variety of cultural influences, and its hard to understand urban planning.\nFor instance, if you walk from one end to another of Rua Augusta (which later becomes Rua Col\u00f4mbia and Avenida Europa), starting from Downtown, you will pass through:\n\nOne of the city's hottest nightlife areas in Baixa Augusta\nA vibrant cultural and business area surrounding Avenida Paulista\nA variety of shopping options in the area surrounding Rua Oscar Freire\nThe green, affluent low-rise neighbourhood of Jardim Am\u00e9rica\nA stream of expensive car shops in Jardim Europa\nThe modern business district in Av. Faria Lima and the ultra-affluent neighbourhood of Itaim\nAlthough the first impression might be that of a grey concrete jungle, soon it becomes apparent that the city has a great number of pockets of beauty, and fantastic places (and not always expensive) to dine, drink and hang out.\n\n\nHistory\n\nNative American Chief Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 and the Jesuit priests Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta and Manuel de N\u00f3brega founded the village of S\u00e3o Paulo de Piratininga on 25 January 1554\u2014Feast of the Conversion of Paul the Apostle. Along with their entourage, the priests established a mission named Col\u00e9gio de S\u00e3o Paulo de Piratininga aimed at converting the Tupi-Guarani native Brazilians to the Catholic religion. S\u00e3o Paulo's first church was constructed in 1616 at the site where the P\u00e1teo do Col\u00e9gio stands now (metr\u00f4: S\u00e9 or S\u00e3o Bento station).\nS\u00e3o Paulo was designated a city in 1711. In the 19th century, it experienced a flourishing economic prosperity, brought about chiefly through coffee exports, which were shipped abroad from the port of neighbouring city Santos. After 1881, waves of immigrants from Italy, Japan, and other European and Middle Eastern countries, such as Syria and Lebanon immigrated to S\u00e3o Paulo State due to the coffee production boom. Enslavement of Africans was coming to an end, due to British pressure, as the British Empire wished to introduce its machinery and industrialized products to Brazil. The government was also concerned with the fact that the population of black people was greater than that of whites, and, in an effort to \"bleach the race,\" gave incentives to European nationals of countries such as Italy, Germany, Lithuania, Ukraine, Poland, Portugal, and Spain to immigrate. Thus, after Emancipation, with the influx of European labor and failure on the part of the racist system to include African-Brazilians, black people became increasing unemployed and discriminated against. By the beginning of the 20th century, the coffee cycle had already plummeted due to, among other factors, a sharp decline in international coffee prices and competition from other nations. The local entrepreneurs then started investing in the industrial development of S\u00e3o Paulo, attracting new contingents of overseas immigrants to the city. Many of those entrepreneurs had Italian, Portuguese, German, and Syro-Lebanese Christian descent such as the Matarazzo, Diniz, and Maluf.\nHowever, due to competition with many other Brazilian cities, which sometimes offer tax advantages for companies to build manufacturing plants in situ, S\u00e3o Paulo's main economic activities have gradually left its industrial profile in favour of the services industry over the late 20th century. The city is nowadays home to a large number of local and international banking offices, law firms, multinational companies, advertising firms and consumer services.\nMany major international and Brazilian companies have offices in S\u00e3o Paulo, and the Bovespa stock exchange index (Ibovespa) is considered one of the most important Latin American market indices abroad.\n\n\nPeople\n\nDon't be surprised at the diversity of Paulistanos. For example, S\u00e3o Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside of Japan. It is not uncommon to see businesses and churches being conducted by Chinese and Korean-Brazilians in Liberdade, which began as an Italian district, became Japanese, and is now heavily populated by Koreans and Chinese. The city's Italian influence is also very strong, with about 6 million people in the metropolitan area having Italian background. The large Arab and Jewish communities are also well represented in all levels of society, from art to real estate businesses, and notably in politics.\nThe citizens of S\u00e3o Paulo have a reputation as hard-working and industrious or shallow money-grubbers. It is common to hear that the people in S\u00e3o Paulo work while the rest of Brazil relaxes; even though many say this, it is plainly wrong. It is a fact, nonetheless, that the city of S\u00e3o Paulo alone actually contributes 15 percent of the country's gross national product (45 percent if the entire S\u00e3o Paulo state is taken into account).\nBut when Paulistanos are not working, they are clubbing. The city nightlife is as intense as it gets, which makes going to a club a total must-do.\n\n\nOrientation\nS\u00e3o Paulo's basic spot for orientation should be Avenida Paulista. From there, it's pretty easy to reach every single spot in town, be it by bus or underground transport. It lies between the neighborhoods of Bela Vista and Jardim Paulista. Av. Paulista is also within walking distance to Centro and Ibirapuera Park, which makes it the perfect place to start a walking tour.\nHowever, central S\u00e3o Paulo is a very large area, and travelling from one spot to another may require that you take a cab or public transport.  To find out the general direction where you are, see the street signs, as it is colour-coded:\n\nS\u00e9/Rep\u00fablica (in Downtown): White street plate.\nAll other areas have blue street plates, and a bottom stripe on the following colours:\n\nExpanded Center: Grey (Expanded Center means the area limited by the Tiet\u00ea river on the North, the Pinheiros river on the West, Avenida dos Bandeirantes on the South and Avenida Salim Farah Maluf on the East)\nNorthwest: Light Green\nNorth: Dark Blue\nNortheast: Yellow\nEast: Red\nSoutheast: Dark Green\nSouth: Light Blue\nSouthwest: Purple\nWest: Orange\nTo find the direction of Downtown (most precisely Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9), just follow the direction of decreasing street numbers. That doesn't work, however, in the Santo Amaro subprefecture (South Central), neither in the Far South region; in these areas, decreasing numbers lead to Largo 13 de Maio.\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe city of S\u00e3o Paulo has a temperate and highly variable climate. Like in Melbourne, in Australia, the locals say that all the four seasons can be enjoyed in a day in S\u00e3o Paulo. Despite being on the Tropic of Capricorn, S\u00e3o Paulo is located at 760 meters (2493 ft) high, which makes the city cooler than normal. Ocean winds keep the air always humid during the year.\nRainfall is heavy in the summer, causing flooding in parts of the city and some rivers overflowing at that time. January is the wettest month, with an average of 237 mm (9.3 inches) of rainfall. The driest month is August, with an average of 40 mm (1.6 inches) of rainfall.\nDue to the city's altitude, temperatures are not usually very hot. In February, the hottest month, temperatures are between average highs of 28\u00ba C (82\u00ba F) and average lows of 19\u00ba C (66\u00ba F). In winter, temperatures are average minimums of 12\u00ba C (53\u00ba F) and average highs of 22\u00ba C (71\u00ba F) in July. However, due to the high concentration of buildings, it may seem warmer in some regions of the city. \n\n\nGet in\nCheck the official Brazil tourism website and the get in section of our article on Brazil for general information regarding visas and customs, and the Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo homepage for updated events and art exhibitions around town.\n\n\nBy plane\nS\u00e3o Paulo (SAO  IATA) has three major airports: Guarulhos International (GRU IATA) and Viracopos (VCP IATA) for international and some domestic arrivals, and Congonhas (CGH  IATA) for most medium and short haul domestic flights.\nIf the flights to S\u00e3o Paulo are high-priced, you can check flying to the airports of Campinas, Rio, Curitiba, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto or Belo Horizonte. From there you can take an intercity bus to S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\nGuarulhos International Airport\n\nSee also: S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport\n1 S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport (GRU IATA) (Located 40 km (25 mi) from the city centre in Guarulhos), \u260f +55 11 2445-2945. If flying into S\u00e3o Paulo from abroad, you'll mostly likely land at Guarulhos International Airport, also known as Cumbica. The airport has three terminals that are served by Brazilian airlines LATAM, Gol and by international airlines United, Delta, American, Air Canada, Air France, British Airways, Lufthansa, Avianca, TAP, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Swiss, and many others.   \nNon-airline shuttle buses are available from Guarulhos to Congonhas Airport (CGH  IATA), Pra\u00e7a da Rep\u00fablica (Downtown), Paulista/Jardins region, Barra Funda bus station and Tiet\u00ea bus station (fastest access to the subway). All lines except Congonhas connect to the Metr\u00f4. R$42 one-way.\nLine 257 is a regular urban bus, which goes every 15-20 min to and from Tatuap\u00e9 Metro station (line 3, red). The ride takes about 35 min and costs R$6.15 (Feb 2018), paid as you board. The bus driver provides change. Exit on the arrivals level at any terminal and follow the signs for the bus. The bus starts at Terminal 2 before heading to Terminal 3 and then 1, and it's recommended to board at Terminal 2 during peak times. Less comfy than the shuttles, but can prove faster way to Paulista (and elsewhere) on days with dense traffic, as it goes for the closest Metro station. While the bus has baggage racks, you might be denied access with luggage that won't fit on your lap.\nLATAM, Gol and Azul, the three main Brazilian airlines, offer free shuttle buses for their passengers with flights to/from Guarulhos International Airport and Congonhas Domestic Airport. Check the schedules for LATAM and Gol. If you're on a budget trip and have enough time, you can ride those buses to Congonhas airport (you must show your boarding pass or printed reservation to the bus driver) and then get a taxi to your destination. It will be much cheaper than getting a taxi directly from Guarulhos airport. The trip between those airports takes between 1 and 1\u00bd hours. No reservation is required.\nA taxi co-operative, Guarucoop (tel: +55 11 2440-7070), has a monopoly on cabs leaving Guarulhos. They are plentiful and the queue is outside the arrival terminal. Credit-card users can pay for their journey in advance at the booth, although it's useful to have local currency as not all international credit or debit cards will work at all businesses in Brazil. Passengers can ask to see the tabela, which shows the fares for each neighbourhood. A taxi ride into the city can take up to two hours during peak times, or around 45 minutes late at night or early in the morning.\nAlso, you can use the \"Airport Express\" direct service to/from Luz station. Railway station is not right near the terminals of the airport. Take a   free shuttle bus.\n\n\nCongonhas Airport\n\n2 S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport (CGH  IATA) (is in a very central region, 15 km (9.3 mi) from downtown). This airport handles most of the domestic flights, including the S\u00e3o Paulo - Rio (Santos Dumont) hop, nicknamed Ponte A\u00e9rea. As it was built in the 1930s, its simple but glamorous architecture is worth seeing.   \nThe easiest (and cheapest) way to get to Congonhas is by taking any of the \"Aeroporto\" regular line buses that run along Avenida Paulista. After some 40-60 min in modest traffic you'll be dropped right in front of the airport and the fare is the regular R$4 (Bilhete \u00danico accepted). It is mostly faster to take the metro to the S\u00e3o Judas subway station, and then the bus from there (10 min). Take bus number 609J/10 just outside of S\u00e3o Judas station to the airport and when getting off at the airport you walk just outside and look for the 607J bus stop.\nCab drives from downtown or Paulista should be used after checking how is the out of control S\u00e3o Paulo traffic. Check the CET website (only in Portuguese), which is the traffic administration department of the city.\n\n\nViracopos International\nViracopos International (CPQ or VCP) is in Campinas, 100 km (62 mi) from downtown S\u00e3o Paulo. It is sometimes used when weather conditions prevent landing in Cumbica. Brazilian airline Azul has its hub here and they offer free bus transport to S\u00e3o Paulo for their passengers, it might be convenient depending on your exact location. TAP flies from Lisbon three times a week to S\u00e3o Paulo.\nAir taxi  Rotorfly is an air taxi company located at the Carapicu\u00edba Helipark in S\u00e3o Paulo. Transport by air by helicopter throughout S\u00e3o Pauo. Could be a great option for quick commutesR. Fortunato Grilenzone, 417 - Sala 8 - Helipark, Carapicu\u00edba - SP, 06333-230 - Telefone: 0800 591 9056\n\n\nBy bus\n\nThere are three main bus terminals in S\u00e3o Paulo, all of them served by the Metr\u00f4 (Subway) network.\n\n Terminal Rodovi\u00e1rio do Tiet\u00ea, Av. Cruzeiro do Sul 1.800, Santana (Tiet\u00ea metro station, Blue line), \u260f +55 11 3235-0322 (reachable from 06:00-23:30). Tiet\u00ea bus terminal is the second largest terminal in the world, hence an enormous building, but there is an information desk in the middle of the main lobby. Buses arrive in S\u00e3o Paulo from destinations throughout Brazil and from international destinations including Asunci\u00f3n in Paraguay (20 hr), Buenos Aires in Argentina (36 hr), Montevideo in Uruguay (30 hr), Santiago in Chile (56 hr), and Lima in Peru (108 hr). Guarulhos International Airport shuttles also depart and arrive from this terminal. \n Terminal Rodovi\u00e1rio da Barra Funda, Av. Auro Soares de Moura Andrade 664, Barra Funda district, Expanded Center (Barra Funda metro station, Red Line), \u260f +55 11 3392-1878. It's west of S\u00e3o Paulo's downtown, and carries departures and arrivals to and from western cities in the S\u00e3o Paulo state, to Mato Grosso, Foz do Igua\u00e7u (15 hr, R$230-260, around 13/19:00) and west Paran\u00e1 cities. About 30 min from Paulista Ave by Metr\u00f4. You can also reach it by boarding the \"Barra Funda\" (875P) bus in Paulista Ave. Guarulhos International Airport shuttles also depart and arrive from this terminal. \n Terminal Rodovi\u00e1rio de Jabaquara, R. dos Jequitib\u00e1s s/n, Jabaquara district, South Side (Jabaquara metro station, Blue Line), \u260f +55 11 3235-0322. The Jabaquara Terminal serves cities in S\u00e3o Paulo state's south coast such as Guaruj\u00e1, Santos and Bertioga. It is 30 minutes away by Metr\u00f4 from downtown. There is a baggage storage (Guarda Volumes) in the Jabaquara Metro. \nAn inexpensive alternative (R$130) for bus travel between Foz do Igua\u00e7u and S\u00e3o Paulo are freight bus companies that handle freight of merchants buying in Paraguay and bus travel at the same time. See the Foz do Igua\u00e7u article for more details. From S\u00e3o Paulo, call ahead to find out from where they start. The companies are the following:\n\n MD Tour, S\u00e3o Paulo, Rua Jo\u00e3o Teodore 628, \u260f +55 11959068201, +55 1138071157. 17-18:00 to/from Sao Paulo, but you should get your ticket already at 15:00 or the day before. R$130. (updated Jun 2018)\n Trans Muleke, S\u00e3o Paolo, Rua Carlos de Souza Nazar\u00e9 526, \u260f +55 1132270461, +55 1122071921, +55 11985805021, +55 11997299818. 17-18:00 to/from Sao Paulo, but you should get your ticket already at 15:00 or the day before. R$130. (updated Jun 2018)\n\n\nBy train\nBesides the extensive commuter rail system, there are no passenger trains of any kind into S\u00e3o Paulo. A proposal to relieve the extremely busy S\u00e3o Paulo - R\u00edo de Janeiro air route through a high-speed rail link is being planned. It is also expected that Brazil's first intercity passenger train will link S\u00e3o Paulo to Campinas by 2031.\n\n\nGet around\nTransport in S\u00e3o Paulo can be anything from joyful to complicated. Usually, the fastest and less stressful way to get around is by bicycle and public transportation, while the experience with cars can be hellish. Peak hours are normally roughly 06:00-09:00 and 16:00-19:00, but since city roads are constantly at maximum capacity, any little incident can cause major queues and delays. The cheapest way for tourists to get around is to use the subway/metro, trains and buses/trolleybuses as much as possible, and then take a taxi for shorter distances. Even these means of transport can be uncomfortably crowded during peaks, and only a very limited carry-on is recommended. You can check the SPTrans website, which is the city's transport administration department. There you can get itineraries using all the city's public transportation options. S\u00e3o Paulo has an extensive network of cycleways and a strong bicycle culture, and riding bikes can be quite enjoyable. Walking can also be very enjoyable depending on the routes.\n\n\nBilhete \u00danico\nThe Bilhete \u00danico is a transport smartcard that is used for paying fares on buses, subways, and trains. In essence, a single billing of the card grants a person up to four trips in S\u00e3o Paulo's public transportation system with free transfers between the subway system and buses within 3 hours. Since September of 2021, only personalized Bilhete \u00danico cards are accepted in the entire transport system. Online emission of cards is only available for Cadastro de Pessoa F\u00edsica (CPF) holders, which means foreign tourists can only obtain a Bilhete \u00danico by going to a SPTrans store with a passport in hand. The stores are listed here. To check if a store can emit a card click on \"Ver servi\u00e7os dispon\u00edveis neste posto\" (Check available services) and look for \"Emiss\u00e3o da 1\u00aa e 2\u00aa via\". But be wary that your card might not be available immediately, so plan accordingly. \nFare charging rules are as follows:\n\nOn buses: upon boarding a bus, you'll be charged R$4.40 and can board up to three other buses in a three-hour period without being charged a second time.\nOn the Metro or CPTM trains: for a single trip in the underground train system, you'll be charged R$5.00.\nFirst Metro/CPTM train then bus: you'll be charged R$5.00 when passing by a Metro or CPTM station's turnstile. Once you board a bus, you'll be charged an extra R$3.20 and will be able to board two other buses in a two-hour period - starting from the first validation at the train station - without any further payment.\nFirst bus then Metro/CPTM train: once you board a bus, R$4.40 is charged from your card. Upon entering the Metro or CPTM systems, you'll be charged a further R$3.80. It's possible, after leaving the Metro or CPTM system, to board up to two other buses without any further payment in the two-hour period that starts from the first validation, depending on whether you boarded one or two buses before entering a train.\nThe discounts do not typically apply to intermunicipal buses (usually in blue and operated by the EMTU company), although there are some exceptions.\n\n\nBy metr\u00f4 and train\n\nThe rail network, composed of metr\u00f4 (subway) and surface trains, is the method of transportation a tourist is likely to use the most while visiting S\u00e3o Paulo. The metr\u00f4 is modern, safe, clean and efficient; the quality of surface trains varies, but those in more tourist areas area as good as the metr\u00f4. An up-to-date map of the rail network can be found in this link.\nLines 1-5 and 9 are probably most useful for tourists.\nThe metro lines are operated by ViaQuatro (Line 4), ViaMobilidade (Line 5), or Metr\u00f4 (all other lines):\n\nLine 1 (Blue): Runs north-south through the Historical Center. Also serves Tiet\u00ea and Jabaquara bus terminals.\nLine 2 (Green): Runs west-east through Avenida Paulista. An extension is under construction.\nLine 3 (Red): Runs west-east (north of Line 2) through the Historical Center. The Barra Funda bus terminal is on the west end of this line.\nLine 4 (Yellow): Connects the Historical Center to the West (mostly south of Line 2), passing through the western portion of Avenida Paulista.\nLine 5 (Lilac): Connects the southwest regions (including Cap\u00e3o Redondo and Santo Amaro) to Lines 1, 2, and 9.\nLine 15 (Silver): A rapid transit monorail line, runs in the eastern suburbs.\nIn addition to the metro, there are a number of suburban trains operated by ViaMobilidade (Lines 8 and 9) and CPTM (all other lines):\n\nLine 7 (Ruby): Serves the northwest suburbs, ending at Luz station downtown.\nLine 8 (Diamond): Serves the west suburbs, ending at J\u00falio Prestes station downtown.\nLine 9 (Emerald): Runs north-south (west of Line 1), crossing the entire West. Does not enter the city center.\nLine 10 (Turquoise): Serves the southeast suburbs, ending at Bras station downtown.\nLine 11 (Coral): Serves the eastern suburbs (parallel to Line 3). Ends at Luz station downtown.\nLine 12 (Sapphire): Serves the eastern suburbs, ending at Bras station downtown.\nLine 13 (Jade): Connects Guarulhos Airport to Line 12, which you can then take to downtown. Also offers an express service directly to Luz station from the airport and back, with one train departing every full hour from each termini.\nSurface trains can also be used to reach a number of other cities in the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo and even beyond. The fee is the same, making some of these trips incredibly cheap depending on where you want to go.\n\n\nFare and hours of operation\n\nIf you don't have a Bilhete \u00danico smart card (see above), trains use a simple flat-price ticketing scheme - you can get only one-trip tickets, which cost R$4.40, and allow you to go as far as you wish. Free train transfers appear as white links on the map; paid transfers as black links; grey links are free transfers during off-peak hours only.\nThe single tickets can be bought at the counters or automatic machines, which can be found in every station. Buying multiple tickets will not save you money but will save time locating a vending machine or waiting time in line, which can both be bothersome. Single tickets are available in paper format or as a QR code. The former is only sold at the counters inside the stations, while the latter can be bought from the automatic machines inside the stations, which are labeled TOP, or from the app with the same name. The app, however, only accepts registrations for Cadastro de Pessoa F\u00edsica (CPF) holders, meaning foreign tourists cannot but them through the app. If you plan to take buses together with trains, using a Bilhete \u00danico card is highly recommended.\nThere are plans to add contactless payment with credit and debit cards on every station, but as of March 2024 only a few turnstiles are enabled for contactless payments in a minority of stations. These can be identified by the global contactless symbol and a list of accepted networks.\nTypical operating hours for trains are Sunday to Friday, from 04:40-00:00 (or Sa to 01:00) or, depending on the station, up to 00:40. Connections on the network operated by Metr\u00f4 are guaranteed only for boardings before midnight (Sa 01:00), regardless of the station. Check the operating companies' website for more updated information.\n\n\nPeak hours\nDaily use of public transport may be quite stressful to Paulistanos; many take more than 2 hours to get to work or school! As a consequence, manners are often left aside on train and metro, and on peak hours, pushes are common. When boarding, walk as far as possible into the train after the door opens, and if you wish to wait for the next train, step outside of the boarding area immediately. Otherwise, you may end up being forcefully pushed into the train.\nInside of the train, it is not uncommon to have a lot of people blocking the way to the door, even if they are not leaving the train in the next station. Unless it is a hub station, politely ask Vai descer aqui? (\"are you going to step out here?\") to make people move on for you to get out.\nPaulistanos do not typically wait for people to get out of the train before getting in. If you are confronted with a mass of people outside when stepping out, walk vigorously, otherwise they may end up pushing you back.\nDo remember to keep on the right side of a metr\u00f4 escalator in order to give way to other people in a hurry - you may be pushed aside if just standing on the left side of it, especially on the busiest hours. Also, should you sit in the assento reservado (reserved seats), be kind enough to give them up for the elderly, pregnant women, parents with babies and disabled people.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses are the most popular way to get around the city. Even though drivers really step on it through the bumpy streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, buses are not the fastest way to get around. In addition, they can get really crowded. However, unlike the metro/train, they do reach every neighbourhood.\nSome lines around the city are serviced by trolleybuses, which, despite using overhead wires for power instead of diesel, work just like regular buses. Trolleybus line 2002-10 runs in and around the city's historic center, and, for that reason, probably is the most useful for tourists. (If you are going to visit Ipiranga Museum, line 4113-10 is also a trolleybus line, and may be useful for you).\nThe bus lines that serve the city of S\u00e3o Paulo are divided into 9 areas, all with different bus lines and boarding and disembarking platforms, passengers can plan the urban bus trip on the SPTRANS official website, however it is not very functional when this offline, so the best alternative is the Bus Route website.\n\u00c1REA 1 - NOROESTE\nBus Terminal Jardim Brit\u00e2nia Bus Terminal Pirituba\n\u00c1REA 2 - NORTE\nBus Terminal Casa Verde Bus Terminal Vila Nova Cachoeirinha\n\u00c1REA 3 - NORDESTE\nBus Terminal A.

You can pay for the ride inside the bus, or use a Bilhete \u00danico card topped up with credits before boarding. If paying for the ticket on the bus, simply hand over the money to the teller sitting by the turnstile or directly to the bus driver - some lines no longer have tellers -, and he or she will let you pass through. Children under 5 years old are allowed by law to slip under the turnstile for free! If you have the Bilhete \u00danico card, then a single fare payment allows you to take other buses for free for the next 3 hours after touching in the card. Scan the card in front of the card reader, and the turnstile will be released. The fare can also be paid with contactless credit or debit cards in select buses. To see if the fare can be paid this way look for a yellow sticker with the global contactless symbol in the front door of the bus.\nIf you are carrying large suitcases, try to avoid rush-hour traffic as buses can become incredibly packed. It is not always wise to take the bus late at night, especially if you find yourself all alone waiting at the bus stop - consider calling a cab instead, or asking someone you know for a lift. If you really need to use the public transport system at night, especially after midnight, there's a special nocturnal service, called \"Noturno\" SPTrans' Noturno service, with bus lines running close to the rail system, which closes for maintenance at this moment, and other high-capacity lanes, providing service between well-lit bus terminals spread across town.\n\n\nBy bicycle\n\nCycleways in S\u00e3o Paulo have been vastly expanded, and the city has about 500 km (310 mi) of bicycle-only paths. A full map of the city's permanent cycling infrastructure can be found in the CET official cycleway map.\nOne of the most popular cycling routes is the Ciclovia Rio Pinheiros, surrounding the Pinheiros river. It has 21.5 km (13.4 mi) on the East side of the river (it is considerably shorter on the West side).\nThe cycleway is a bit tricky to access - check the cycleway's official website for a listing of access points. The cycleway offers great views of the city, including the city's main business district in Brooklin and Vila Ol\u00edmpia (see S\u00e3o Paulo/West) but the terrible smell of the Pinheiros river can be hard to cope with.\nDespite the growing bicycle infrastructure, S\u00e3o Paulo is hardly one of the easiest places in the world to get around by bike. Many drivers have little respect for cyclists and accidents aren't rare, such that helmets are a must, and extra attention must be taken when making turns or riding outside cycleways. Use bike boxes and dedicated cycling lanes whenever possible. Many cycleways are heavily under-utilised, such that pedestrians rarely pay attention on them when walking, so a cyclist must also watch out for them. Finally, long distance cycleways can lead to dangerous areas of the city; as a rule of thumb, if you won't go to a certain part of the city on foot, don't go with a bicycle! Don't take expensive bicycles to poorer areas of the city or to desolated, sparsely habited areas (like for example the Tiet\u00ea river cycleway in the east of the city), as you might be assaulted.\nFor those without much adventure spirit, a leisure-oriented and safe option is the Ciclofaixa de Lazer on Sundays (see #Do section), where several of the city's main roads are open for cycling.\nCyclists with bicycles are allowed in the metro/train network at the following times:\n\nIn the metro (Metr\u00f4/Via Quatro/Via Mobilidade): Monday-Friday starting from 20:30, Saturday starting from 14:00, Sundays and holidays the whole day\nIn surface trains (CPTM/Via Mobilidade): Saturday starting from 14:00, Sundays and holidays the whole day\nThere are public bicycle parking lots in many metro stations (06:00-22:00 daily), and in some it is also possible to borrow a bike using a credit card. Check the Metr\u00f4 website for an up-to-date list of stations with infrastructure for bicycles. Parking lots (mainly the ones designed for cars) may not accept your bicycle, so if you are to chain yours to a pole, use a good chain with a strong lock. In metro/train stations, cyclists are allowed to put their bicycles on escalators to go up, but not to go down.\nSince May 2012, a scheme called Bike Ita\u00fa, a partnership between the city hall and Ita\u00fa Bank, inspired by a similar initiative in Rio de Janeiro, allows for renting bikes from one of the standing rails for a fee, please check the official website for up-to-date prices. The rental price can be quite expensive, especially if you take one of the service's new electric bikes. Users must first download Bike Ita\u00fa's mobile app to use the system.\n\n\nOn foot\nWalking is certainly the best way of exploring and feeling the urban life of S\u00e3o Paulo. The Historic Center area and Avenida Paulista are definitely places to be explored on foot, but there are many others such as Jardins and Vila Madalena. Check the individual district listings for other nice walks.\nCompared to other metropolises in emerging countries, S\u00e3o Paulo is actually not the hardest place to walk. Pedestrian paths are plenty (although sometimes poorly maintained) as are zebra crossings with semaphores. Zebra crossings without semaphores are completely ignored by drivers. Despite the reasonably good pedestrian infrastructure, care is advised whenever crossing the streets; watch out for cars that may come unexpectedly, even if the pedestrian lights are green. Do not try to cross large roads with a high volumes of car traffic: usually there will be a pedestrian viaduct or bridge at some point in the sidewalk. Some parts of town, especially the Historic Center, can be dangerous to visit on foot, due to a recent rise in street violence (notably 2022). Check with a tour guide to make sure which places are best for you.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxi ranks in S\u00e3o Paulo are white, with a distinctive luminous green \"TAXI\" sign on the roof top. Check out for the white color of the taxi rank (unless it's a radio taxi), the official license sticker with the driver's name and photo on the passenger side of the control panel, and the red license plate.\nThere are two kinds of cabs: cheaper  street-hail and radio taxi. White taxis are often found at stands near city squares and big venues. Radio taxis can be ordered by telephone; ask reception at your hotel for help to call a radio cab, or just call a company. Some companies, such as the radio taxi company S\u00e3o Paulo Airport Transfers, now provide an online, fixed price, quote and book service.  Taxis in S\u00e3o Paulo are relatively expensive compared to other large cities worldwide and, depending on the neighborhood, there is a risk of being overcharged if you're a foreigner.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nS\u00e3o Paulo is covered by some e-hailing services, Uber being the largest of them. Notable e-hailing services in the city, are:\n\nUber (covers neighbor cities, like Guarulhos and Osasco as well)\nCabify\nT81 (Brazilian service)\nEasy (Brazilian service)\n99 Taxi (Brazilian service)\n\n\nBy car\n\nRenting a car in S\u00e3o Paulo is typically neither practical nor cost-effective. The daily rent plus fuel and parking fees typically far exceeds what you would spend with taxis or e-hailing. Even when you can borrow a car for free from a friend or your company, getting around by car is borderline crazy if you're not used to S\u00e3o Paulo. Traffic can be chaotic and parking is a nightmare. It is also not so straightforward to find your way in certain neighbourhoods where streets can get windy. Usually, taxi or e-hailing, or a combination of taxi/e-hailing and public transportation, provides you all the commodity of cars with much less stress, so much that many car owners in S\u00e3o Paulo prefer to leave their cars at home during weekdays. However, if you plan to visit places outside the S\u00e3o Paulo city proper (in the Grande S\u00e3o Paulo or beyond), renting a car might be worthwhile.\nIf you're comfortable enough to adventure yourself and feel more like a paulistano, feel free to explore the city from behind a steering-wheel. There is some information about driving in town that you should know beforehand:\nRotating transit policy (Rod\u00edzio): In order to reduce the congestion and the air pollution in S\u00e3o Paulo, the city council has adopted a mandatory rotating transit policy: cars whose license plate number ends in 1 and 2 cannot circulate on Mondays; if it ends on 3 or 4, Tuesday is off; 5 or 6, stay home or take a cab on Wednesdays; 7 or 8, Thursday is the unlucky day; 9 or 0, on Fridays you can walk. The prohibition is valid only on the so-called Expanded Center (blue street plates with grey bottom stripe), and for peak hours: 07:00-10:00 and 17:00-20:00. During the remaining hours, cars are allowed to circulate freely.\n\nParking fees (Zona Azul or \"Blue Zone\"): The city council charges a parking fee of R$5 for up to two hours parking in several points of the city, the so-called \"Zona Azul\" areas, so be careful not to be fined for not paying the charge. Parking tickets for Zona Azul can only be obtained digitally, by purchasing credits via the DigiPare, Vaga Inteligente and SP Cart\u00e3o Azul Digital Android/iOS apps, and filling the car plate number. Credits can also be purchased via several authorised shops, newspaper stands, and snack bars typically located near the Zona Azul parking spots.\nDriving at night: Buses stop at 01:00 (except for the Noturno service) and the metro around midnight, so it can be tricky to get to many of the famous bars and night clubs unless you take a taxi, or... drive. If you go out at night by car, expect to pay a small fee to unofficial \"car keepers\" in order to park your car along the streets. This is a common use in many busy outing hubs around town, which may seem unfair given that parking your car in the streets is free of charge after 19:00, but they occasionally may check your car against stereo robbers (and may damage your car if you refuse to pay). If the neighbourhood seems a bit dodgy or deserted, try to find a parking lot rather than parking on the streets.\nValet services: Most bars and restaurants offer non-compulsory parking and valet services to customers, for which you will be charged a fee. These services are often covered by insurance, nevertheless, whenever using valet services, do not leave valuables such as handbags, wallets, electronics and sunglasses in the car, as these items are usually not covered by the insurance policies in parking spaces.\nSee Driving in Brazil for other useful information.\n\n\nTalk\nAs in the rest of Brazil, most Paulistanos are effectively monolingual Portuguese speakers, although a number of well-educated people will have some command of English, especially in main business areas like Avenida Paulista, Faria Lima and Berrini. English is generally spoken at main hotels, youth hostels, upmarket bars and restaurants and tourism-related businesses, although a menu in English is a rare find. Spanish is generally nonexistent.\nMost Italians, Japanese and Arab descendants are not able to fluently speak the language of the country where their ancestors came from, with the exception being generally the older generation. Many younger Japanese-Brazilians can speak or understand some Japanese but are unable to read or write it. Later immigrants like Koreans and Chinese are more likely to speak their language of origin.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nAvenida Paulista\nMain article: S\u00e3o Paulo/Paulista\nAvenida Paulista (Paulista Avenue) is one of S\u00e3o Paulo's most popular postcards, as it is the pride of Paulistanos. It is one of the largest business centers, and probably the largest cultural region in the city. Its architectural contrast reflects the fact that the avenue is located between the \"old\" and \"new\" parts of the city.\nThe avenue and its surroundings, such as Rua Augusta, Alameda Santos and Rua Oscar Freire, contain numerous shop galleries, art galleries, theatres, movie theaters, pubs, hotel, coffee shops, bookstores, and gourmet restaurants. Gay nightlife is intense on Consolacao and Haddock Lobo Streets.\n\n\nHistoric center\n\nMain article: S\u00e3o Paulo/Downtown\nS\u00e3o Paulo's Historic Center met a period of degradation, but it is gradually recovering with recent projects and investments. Even through it still has some problems, it is an area to not be missed due to its historical and cultural value for the city. Here you can find many constructions and landmarks from glorious moments of S\u00e3o Paulo's history, ridiculously crowded commercial areas, and a multitude of theatres and cultural activities.\n\n\nRio Pinheiros river area\nMain article: S\u00e3o Paulo/West\nThe Pinheiros river crosses the West of S\u00e3o Paulo in North-South direction, and although heavily polluted, the neighbourhoods surrounding the river are among the most beautiful and interesting areas of the city. The East shore is filled with skyscrapers that compose the business centers of Faria Lima, Brooklin Novo and Vila Ol\u00edmpia, and contains the longest cycleway of the city, as well as one of the most vibrant nightlife areas. The West shore is home to University of S\u00e3o Paulo and exhibits a stereotypical portrait of S\u00e3o Paulo's social inequality, contrasting luxurious apartments and mansions with low class suburbs and favelas. In the middle of the river, stands the magnificent Ponte Octavio Frias, more known as Ponte Estaiada. The Line 9-Emerald train line runs alongside the river, making all spots quite easy to reach.\n\n\nParks\n\nAlthough S\u00e3o Paulo is commonly associated with gray, concrete, and lack of green space, the Atlantic rainforest still covers large portions of the city and even of the municipality. These green areas are constantly under threat by irregular occupation, so the government has turned many of them into public parks in order to better protect them.\nParks in the city can be divided into three types:\n\nLeisure parks are those with plenty of recreational, sport and cultural facilities, but do not contain considerable amounts of original vegetation. Parque Ibirapuera (see S\u00e3o Paulo/South Central) is certainly the most famous park of this type in the city, hosting various museums, monuments, and cultural activities. There are also plenty of activities for tourist with guided tours for birdwatch, tree's identification and a general and popular one Discovering the Ibirapuera Park, all managed by Parque Ibirpauera Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o;\nEcotourism parks are those which are mostly covered by the Atlantic rainforest and other natural ecosystems, and contain limited recreational facilities. They are suited for those seeking an adventure. These include Parque Estadual da Cantareira (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Northeast and Guarulhos), APA Capivari-Monos (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Far South) and Parque Estadual do Jaragu\u00e1 (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Northwest).\nMixed parks are a mix between the two above types: they have both leisure facilities and preserved nature areas. They are a nice option if you think that nature is best enjoyed with the company of other people, or if you want to do something more relaxing and less adventurous. These include Parque do Carmo, Parque Ecol\u00f3gico do Tiet\u00ea (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Far East) and Horto Florestal (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Northeast).\nCheck the individual district listings for a more comprehensive list of parks and more detailed information.\n\n\nMuseums and cultural centers\nAs the art center of the country, S\u00e3o Paulo offers many museums and cultural centers.\nTwo museums to not be missed, due to their size, architecture, and historical importance, are Museu do Ipiranga (Southeast) (closed as of May 2019) and Memorial da Am\u00e9rica Latina (West).\nAppreciators of art should also check Museu de Arte de S\u00e3o Paulo (Paulista), Pinacoteca do Estado (Downtown), Instituto Tomio Ohtake, Museu de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea (West) and Museu de Arte Moderna (South Central).\nCheck each district section of this guide for a comprehensive list of museums.\n\n\nPanoramic views\nS\u00e3o Paulo is a beautiful city seen from above, so spare some time to go to one of the few points where you'll be able to see how far this city extends to, specially at sunset.\n\n Banespa Tower, Rua Jo\u00e3o Br\u00edcola, 24, Centro. S\u00e3o Bento Metr\u00f4 station, \u260f +55 11 3249-7180. M-F 10:00-17:00. The observation deck is on the 34th floor, 160 m above ground. For many decades, it used to be the highest building in town. There is a small museum on the top of the building.  Make sure and bring ID (passport) because it is required for entrance. 35R$. \n Restaurant Skye, Hotel Unique, Avenida Brigadeiro Luiz Ant\u00f4nio, 4700. On the rooftop of posh Hotel Unique, Skye serves excellent fusion food under the supervision of chef Emmanuel Bassoleil. Good for night views of the area around Ibirapuera Park. Free. \n S\u00e3o Paulo Jockey Club, Av. Lineu de Paula Machado, 1263. There are two bars and a couple of posh restaurants with a great view of the River Pinheiros, especially around 18:00, when you can go straight from work or a busy day walking about to watch the sun set above town. Free. \n\n\nDo\n\n\nTheaters and concert halls\n\nThe two most important concert and opera houses of the city are Theatro Municipal and Sala S\u00e3o Paulo (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Historic Center). S\u00e3o Paulo has a great number of theaters, most of which feature plays in Portuguese. The British Cultural Centre, Goethe Institute, Instituto Cervantes and Alliance Fran\u00e7aise occasionally have plays in English, German, Spanish and French, respectively; check individual District listings.\n\n\nCiclofaixa de Lazer\nThe Ciclofaixa de Lazer (Leisure Cycling Lane) comprises dozens of kilometers of interconnected cycling lanes, in the central, south and west areas of the city, that are available on Sundays and some holidays, between 07:00-16:00. It interconnects most places of interest of the city - Downtown, Avenida Paulista, Parque do Ibirapuera, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Pinheiros river business centers and the Guarapiranga reservoir, although certainly not using the shortest paths. Bicycle borrowing and renting is available at Parque das Bicicletas (in Parque do Ibirapuera) and at Pra\u00e7a do Ciclista (at Avenida Paulista), but try to get a bicycle in advance if possible.\nSince the cycling route is family-oriented, signaling and safety standards are high. The route is strictly intended for recreational, not sportive cycling, so set your speed accordingly in the presence of other cyclists. A full map of the route, as well as other useful information, are available here.\n\n\nFun for the family\nBoth adults and kids are ensured to have fun by seeing the animals in the S\u00e3o Paulo Zoo and in the S\u00e3o Paulo Aquarium (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Southeast). S\u00e3o Paulo also has educative spaces aimed both at adults and children, including Catavento Cultural (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Downtown) and Espa\u00e7o Ci\u00eancia (see S\u00e3o Paulo/West). Finally, Mundo da Xuxa (see S\u00e3o Paulo/South Central) is a theme park only for the small ones.\n\n\nWatch football\n\nFootball (soccer) is an inherent part of Brazilian culture, and S\u00e3o Paulo is no exception, being home of four football teams that generally run in the 1st division: Corinthians, S\u00e3o Paulo, Palmeiras and Portuguesa. The five large football stadiums in the city are Morumbi, Allianz Parque (see S\u00e3o Paulo/West), Pacaembu (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Historic Center), Arena Corinthians (also popularly known as \"Itaquer\u00e3o\") and Canind\u00e9 (see S\u00e3o Paulo/Southeast). A word of warning, however: although most matches are safe and fun events, games between the biggest local rivals (Corinthians, S\u00e3o Paulo, Palmeiras and, to a smaller extent, Santos) have had episodes of violence flaring up (in the majority of cases, such incidents happen outside of the stadium), due to a number of violent fans (ultras). The Derby Paulista in particular being Palmeiras and Corinthians is ranked among the most intense in the world. Going to such games can be a risky proposition. Portuguesa games are safe, have few supporters, and are very peaceful and curious (meets the Portuguese community in the city).\n\n\nCity tours\nS\u00e3o Paulo Historical City Tour is a panoramic tour for those keen to have an introduction to the history, culture, and the lifestyle of the biggest city in the Southern Hemisphere. The city tour takes about 3 hours, during which the visitor will pass by places in S\u00e3o Paulo's Old Centre and get familiar with attractions such as the Cathedral of S\u00e9, P\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio (short stop at the square, the site where the city was founded), Monastery of S\u00e3o Bento, the Banespa Building (S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s answer to the Empire State Building), the Martinelli Building (the first skyscraper in South America), Viaduto do Ch\u00e1 (Tea Viaduct), the Municipal Theater, Sala S\u00e3o Paulo concert hall, Esta\u00e7ao da Luz train station and the Municipal Market.\n TurisMetr\u00f4. Offer a variety of city tours every weekend. These are mostly walking tours but with some use of the metro. The tour is free of charge, but you will need to take some cash with you to buy metro tickets during the tour as necessary. The tours start at the TurisMetr\u00f4 desk in S\u00e9 metro station at 09:00 and 14:00 on Saturdays and Sundays; you will need to arrive half an hour earlier to sign up. The desk is inside the ticket turnstiles, so if you arrive by metro don't exit the station past the turnstiles while looking for the desk or you'll have to pay for an extra ticket to get back in. If you are already around the station, you will have to pay for a ticket to gain access to the desk, although you can use it to make the first journey of the tour so it's not wasted. The guides speak English. \n\n\nEvents\nAccording to the S\u00e3o Paulo Convention & Visitors Bureau, S\u00e3o Paulo hosts 90,000 events a year, from meetings and conferences to sports and cultural events. Events tied to a particular region are listed in the individual district sections. The following events are considered important to the city as a whole:\n\n S\u00e3o Paulo Carnival, Avenida Olavo Fontoura, 1209, Santana (at the Samb\u00f3dromo from Parque Anhembi, near Armenia and Tiete stations), \u260f +55 11 2226-0400. If you're in S\u00e3o Paulo during the annual Carnival, a national bank holiday between the end of February and March. This is where the typical Carnival parade takes place, with dancers dressed up in costumes and musicians play samba songs on the top of fancy cars. If you can afford it, get tickets closest to the \"pista\" (standing area, close to the parade itself). This will give you a premium view of the parade, and the possibility of comfortably sitting down on benches. Waiters pass to and fro selling chocolate, chips, beer, soft drinks and booze. Another option is to visit one of the various samba schools in town, where you can see the rehearsal concerts of musicians and dancers. You can even have the opportunity to join the parade at the time of Carnival holidays by acquiring the costume from a samba school and getting in touch with the people organising the event in one of the schools. However, S\u00e3o Paulo is not a traditional Carnaval destination for Brazilians, like Rio. The city will usually be less crowded on Carnaval then usual, as Paulistanos leave for the Paulista Coast or other states. \n Gay Pride Parade, Avenida Paulista. Every year, during Corpus Christi holidays (usually between May and June), around 3 million people take part in the largest Gay Pride parade in the world. It takes place on a Sunday, and Avenida Paulista is the spot to head to. Floats bustling with electronic music parade from MASP to Rep\u00fablica, while every type imaginable marches along. The drinks are plenty and the rave party feel keeps the paraders dancing way pass sunset. \n Virada Cultural (Downtown). Virada Cultural is a round-the-clock cultural marathon that takes place in various parts of the Historic Center (Downtown), happening yearly around April\u2013May. It is a free event that gathers an audience of several million of people circulating during a 24-hour, non-stop cultural party. Exceptionally, the metro and train work uninterruptedly during the event. During the 2012 edition, there were about 1,300 shows and 15 km (9.3 mi) of streets were occupied. Free. \nBrazilian Grand Prix is a Formula One motor race held at Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace in the  Interlagos district to the south. It's held in November.\n\n\nLearn\n\nUniversity of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) is Brazil's most important university in terms of academic research and international reputation, with its main campus located in the West. It was considered the top university of Latin America according to the QS Ranking. Other important public universities present in the city are Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo (UNIFESP) (see S\u00e3o Paulo/South Central) and Federal University of ABC (UFABC) (see Santo Andr\u00e9).\nThe city also contains many traditional private high education institutions. Check the individual district sections for a comprehensive list of them.\n\n\nInformation for students\n\nBrazil has exchange programmes with many internationally-recognized universities. In order to register at a Brazilian university as an exchange student, you must obtain a student visa at the Brazilian Embassy or Consulate in your home country. After you have arrived in Brazil with a valid student visa, then you must register in the Departamento da Pol\u00edcia Federal (Federal Police Department) within 30 days of your arrival and obtain the RNE (Registro Nacional do Estrangeiro), which is the national ID card for overseas citizens. This is also where you can renew your visa with the Brazilian authorities. It is located at Rua Hugo Dantola, 95, Alto da Lapa, near Ponte do Piqueri (Piqueri Bridge). It is open M-F 08:00-14:00.\nBy bus:From Avenida Paulista to the Policia Federal department, you can take the bus line \"669-A/10 Terminal Princesa Isabel\" in front of Trianon-Masp Metro station (on the same side of MASP museum), get off at the final stop, then take bus \"978-J Voith\" and get off at Rua Hermano Marchete, 1030. Walk up the street until you see the Policia Federal. To return, take the same bus \"978-J\" to Terminal Princesa Isabel. Then, take bus \"669-A/10 Terminal Sto. Amaro\" to return to Avenida Paulista.\nBy train: From Metro station Barra Funda (Linha 3 - Red), take the CPTM metropolitan train (Linha 7 - Ruby) to Lapa station.\n\n\nInstitutions\n British Council, Rua Ferreira Ara\u00fajo, 741, T\u00e9rreo, Pinheiros, \u260f +55 11 2126-7526, fax: +55 11 2126-7564. \n Alian\u00e7a Russa de Ensino Superior, Av.

Imported goods can be expensive, but look out for Brazilian-made bargains in all categories. Spend some time in one of the many \"shoppings\" (as Brazilians call the shopping malls) and also look out for areas with shops catering for specific interests.\nRemember that street shops usually operate 10AM-6PM, including Saturdays (when they close earlier), but are closed on Sundays. The countless shopping malls operate M-Sa 10AM-10PM and Su 10AM-8PM.\n\n\nCentral shopping areas\n\nThe area between Avenida Ipiranga and Parque Dom Pedro II (Downtown) is the closest to what S\u00e3o Paulo has from a \"central shopping area\", with various pedestrianized and non-pedestrianized shopping streets. The exceptionally crowded Rua 25 de Mar\u00e7o, with its diverse range of bargains, is perhaps the most famous commercial street of the area.\nAvenida Paulista and Rua Augusta (Paulista) form a smooth transition between the popular commerce of Downtown and the affluent commerce of Rua Oscar Freire (West).\nS\u00e3o Paulo has also many specialized shopping areas, such as Rua Teodoro Sampaio (West) for furniture and musical instruments, Rua Jos\u00e9 Paulino (Downtown) and Br\u00e1s neighborhood (Southeast) for bargain and wholesale clothing, Liberdade neighbourhood (Downtown) for cosmetics and Asian products, and Rua Santa Ifig\u00eania (Downtown) for electronic equipment.\n\n\nShopping malls\n\nPaulistanos, especially those with higher income, have an indoor shopping culture. The fear of criminality, traffic and S\u00e3o Paulo's unpredictable weather are strong factors to this. Shopping malls in S\u00e3o Paulo are not only centers of \"shopping\" but also leisure areas, typically offering spaces for kids, cinemas, food courts, and sometimes even theatres, expositions, and sport areas. Many shopping malls in S\u00e3o Paulo also offer miscellaneous services such as banks, laundry, repairs, and sometimes even police stations and doctors.\nThe selection of shops of a mall depends on the type of public predominant in the surroundings: at shopping malls located at working-class neighborhoods, it is easier to find bargain department stores, while shopping malls in wealthy areas may be the only way to have access to exclusive designer stores. Check the individual district listings for a comprehensive list of shopping malls in the city.\nSome shopping malls that deserve special mention are Morumbi/Market Place (South Central - with more than 600 shops and dozens of restaurants), Eldorado (West - with an immense food court), Iguatemi (West - the oldest shopping mall of S\u00e3o Paulo, with very upscale profile), JK Iguatemi (West - the newest shopping mall for the wealthy Paulistanos), Cidade Jardim (West - famous for its internal gardens), Aricanduva (Far East - the city's largest and most famous working class shopping mall), and Frei Caneca (Downtown - the favorite of the LGBT public).\n\n\nSuburban shopping areas\nFar from Downtown, there are many suburban shopping areas. The busiest of them is probably the area around Largo 13 de Maio (South Central), the \"central shopping area\" of the former city of Santo Amaro, now part of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nThere are also the open markets (feiras livres) and municipal markets (where you can buy fresh and cheaper fruit, vegetables and meat), supermarkets and atacados (a type of supermarket where you pay less if buy at least a certain quantity, very convenient for families).\nMost of these local commerce centers are not listed in this guide, but they are of extreme importance in the daily life of Paulistanos.\n\n\nCosts\nS\u00e3o Paulo has the highest living cost in the Americas, and it's the 10th most expensive city in the world, according to the Mercer Worldwide Cost of Living 2011 Survey. However, it should be remarked that such rankings are based on averages, which hardly  describe a city as huge and with so many contrasts as S\u00e3o Paulo.\nIt is absolutely possible to enjoy the city's attractions while spending a moderate amount of cash in both accommodations and food. Ask locals for tips how to make the best out of your money if you're on a tight budget.\n\n\nEat\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is home to a superb diversity of restaurants and cuisines, where you can enjoy typical dishes from literally all over the world. The price range is as wide as the diversity of the restaurants in the city, from cheap snacks and meals in simple and cozy restaurants and food tents in popular markets, to the hugely expensive high end cuisine and internationally recognized restaurants, such as D.O.M, which was (in 2012) named the 4th best restaurant in the world and the best in South America by The World's 50 Best Restaurants.\nThe city is also home to a vast array of Brazilian and international fast-food chains, offering varying options ranging from burgers, to sushi and kebab. The fast-food chain Habib's, which originated in S\u00e3o Paulo, is the favorite of lower class Paulistanos due to its cheap \"Arab-Brazilian\" snacks.\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, the ever-present beans-and-rice accompaniment typically involves brown beans instead of black beans, as in Rio. Another local specialty in S\u00e3o Paulo is the Virado \u00e0 Paulista, which consists of rice, tutu de feij\u00e3o (a paste of beans and manioc flour; sometimes made of corn flour, in order to be drier than the manioc flour one), kale saut\u00e9ed with garlic (couve) and pork chops, typically bisteca. It is usually accompanied by pork rinds, bits of sausage, a fried egg and a fried banana.\nOne dish that claims its local character is the bauru sandwich, allegedly created by a druken student from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo's law school at the Ponto Chic restaurant after a long night out. It consists of four types of melted cheese and sliced roastbeef, and it still endures as one ubiquitous snack in padarias (Brazilian-style eateries).\nJapanese restaurants of the rodizio style are found pretty much everywhere, but mainly in the past decade, S\u00e3o Paulo became world famous for its excellent Japan-like and fusion restaurants, including ramen and udon shops and exquisite sushi and sashimi sets, which sometimes even come at a reasonable price. Many of these types of restaurants can be found down rua Tomaz Gonzaga in Liberdade, where connaisseurs of good food have already found their way in. On weekends, these restaurants can be packed, so arrive early to avoid queues.\nAnother typical type of restaurant in S\u00e3o Paulo are the world-famous churrascarias, where an enormous range of meats and cuts comes to your table by the stick; they also offer a range of sides and salads. In those places, you can eat as much as you want. This system is called rod\u00edzio, and it has been very successful in the city, spreading to other types of cuisine like Italian, where you can find the rod\u00edzio de pizza and Japanese, with the rod\u00edzio de sushi.\nThe cuisine of S\u00e3o Paulo shows the influence of European, Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants. The majority of immigrants in S\u00e3o Paulo arrived from Italy, and other European countries like Portugal, Spain and Germany. There are also large numbers of Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants from Japan, Lebanon and many other countries. Therefore, it is possible to find a wide array of cuisines in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. Pizza is a particularly popular dish, which can be found with an endless range of toppings, and paulistas will swear their city has the best pizza in the country, if not in the world.\nWhen eating out, a tip of 10 percent on the value of the bill is usually included. Some restaurants don't include this service charge (when you may come across the message \"Servi\u00e7o n\u00e3o incluso\" at the end of the bill), but unless the staff are upsettingly rude, do pay the standard 10 percent tip as it is usually part of their wages.\n\n\nDrink\n\nYou will have no trouble finding bars in S\u00e3o Paulo, where you can enjoy an ice cold beer, a shot of cacha\u00e7a or a caipirinha - or anything else for that matter. Vila Madalena and Itaim have a very high concentration of bars, and are great spots for an all-nighter. For specific suggestions of bars, check the district section.\n\n\nClubs\nThis city has an unbelievably rich and diverse night life, and is able to provide entertainment for all tastes, from traditional samba-rock live music to electro-pop night clubs, raves and even some fetish clubs. It is worth planning at least one night out while you're in town. On the other hand, S\u00e3o Paulo's nightlife can be quite expensive; most clubs charge an entrance fee.\nThe main areas for nightlife in the city are Vila Ol\u00edmpia, Vila Madalena, and Barra Funda (West), Moema (South Central), Tatuap\u00e9 and Mooca (Southeast), and Santana (Northeast). The Downtown has also experimented an impressive revival of nightlife. Be sure to check the individual District listings.\nVisit this website or buy one of the paper editions to have the latest clubbing updates.\n\n\nSleep\nIf you plan to explore the city and cannot rely on car/taxi, staying near a Metro or train station is a very wise choice. Just be sure to avoid degraded areas. For lists of recommended hotels in the city, see the individual District listings. If you wish to stay close to the airport, please see the article on Guarulhos.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nBy phone\n\nPublic telephone booths can be found on almost every corner of town. They work with phonecards only, which can be bought at any newspaper stand. Regular phonecards allow you to make local and national calls, but the credits fall at an incredible rate if the call is directed to another city or to mobile phones. There is a special phonecard for international calls, so make sure you ask the clerk for the correct one if that's the case.\nThe city code (also known locally as the DDD code) for S\u00e3o Paulo is 11), hence local telephone numbers have the following format: +55 11 0000-0000. If you are making local calls, the +55 11 prefix should be dropped.\nWhen making national calls from SP, you have the option to choose your telephone provider: dial 0 followed by (15) Telef\u00f3nica, (23) Intelig or (21) Embratel, plus the two-digit DDD code and telephone number.\nWhen making international calls from S\u00e3o Paulo to abroad, you also have the option to choose your telephone provider: dial 00 followed by (15) Telef\u00f3nica, (23) Intelig or (21) Embratel, plus the country code and telephone number.\nTo make reverse charge calls within the same city code area, dial 90 90 + the telephone number (do not use the city code (11)).\nTo make reverse charge calls to other cities, dial 90 followed by (15) Telef\u00f3nica, (23) Intelig or (21) Embratel, plus the 2-digit DDD code and the telephone number.\n\n\nInternet\nInternet caf\u00e9s (also called cyber caf\u00e9s or lan houses) can be easily found in every neighborhood.\nAlso, S\u00e3o Paulo has many open WiFi spots\u2014often you just need to login with Facebook.\n\n\nRespect\nPeople from S\u00e3o Paulo kiss on the right cheek once when they say hello, goodbye and nice to meet you. Some will kiss twice, once on each cheek, a kiss in the air. Men kiss women on the cheek and women kiss women as well, but two men won't give the kiss out unless they're gay or with intimate long-time friends or family. If you feel the occasion is a bit formal, especially on business occasions or if you don't know the person too well, a handshake will do the job. However, if a Paulistano takes the initiative to kiss, make sure you turn your face to the left side to avoid embarrassment.\n\n\nBusiness etiquette\nPaulistanos do appreciate if you are on time. However, given the infamous traffic congestion that prevails in town, a 15-30 min delay in a meeting is usually tolerated, and you shouldn't worry too much if you or someone else turns up a bit late. In general, do not plan more than two meetings per day, with a possible lunch meeting in between, due to the traffic delay in getting from place to place.\nOffice hours are usually from 9AM-6PM, and banks are open M-F 10AM-4PM. However, don't be surprised if a meeting is scheduled after 6PM, as the business culture in S\u00e3o Paulo is a bit workaholic.\nSmall gifts are usually gladly accepted, but exchanging presents is not the general rule.\nIt is always safer to first adopt a business attire to a meeting\u2014suit and tie for men, business suit for women\u2014even if you turn out to be a bit overdressed in a more informal business environment.\nBefore a meeting starts, it is not unusual to have some 5-10 min of informal chat, not related to the business to be discussed (traffic, weather forecasts, and football matches are accepted example topics). To cut short this informal chit chat might appear slightly rude and potentially embarrassing.\n\n\nGay and lesbian travelers\nS\u00e3o Paulo is the host of one of the biggest Gay Pride parades in the world, attracting every year about 4 million people. Although paulistanos are relatively tolerant to homosexuality, openly public displays of affection between people, especially of same sex are uncommon and likely to attract attention, with the exception of places such as Frei Caneca and Rua Augusta, and at some bars, coffee shops and night clubs. Such displays of affection should be completely avoided in poorer neighborhoods and on public transport, where prejudice is more likely to be openly manifested.\n\n\nTraffic\nMain article: Driving in Brazil\nWhile most people will drive carefully and respecting the rules, you are sure to see some paulistanos cutting you off, crossing where there's no zebra crossings, using bus-exclusive lanes and taking lefts or rights without signalizing their intentions. Bear in mind that if you do this to someone, they might just not care, but some could sound the horn, show you the finger, or even get out the car to physically confront you. That said, it's always best to avoid arguments.\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nCrime\nS\u00e3o Paulo, once one of the most violent cities of Brazil, has managed to drastically reduce crime during the 2000s. According to the Sangari Institute, S\u00e3o Paulo was the safest capital city of Brazil in 2011, in terms of homicide rate.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't mean that a visitor can really relax about safety, because S\u00e3o Paulo is simply too large and diverse to be described by average statistics. In fact, two of the most visited areas, Downtown and the Pinheiros subprefecture (in the West), have respectively 150% and 50% more violent crime than the city average. Check the individual district listings for safety advice in each area of the city. The general advice is as follows:\n\nVisitors should avoid walking in deserted areas at night, or at least avoid walking alone. Buses are reasonably safe, but waiting alone at a bus stop at night is not. The metro is always safe, but commuter trains that go to peripheral areas can be dangerous late at night. Be extremely careful when using ATMs at night (or better, do not use them if they are in deserted and dark places. If you really need one, try searching in places like shopping malls, theaters and cinemas and gas stations).\nDriving can sometimes also be risky, especially when you are alone and/or in an upscale bars/clubbing area, like Vila Madalena or Vila Ol\u00edmpia. If you are driving at night, when stopping for whatever reason (even at a traffic light), check your surroundings. Keep your doors locked and windows closed during the night. If possible, when going back late to the hotel, take a cab or ride with a group of friends. During the day, keep valuable objects away from the window (even if you are using a taxi).\nSome areas can be dangerous even during the day. These include run-down areas, like favelas and areas populated by drug addicts. The last can be easily recognized by the presence of poorly maintained buildings, bad odor, and dirty streets - there are many of those in the Historic Center. Most drug addicts are harmless, but a few may resort to violence to get money to buy their drugs. Contrary to popular belief, nowadays poor neighbourhoods in S\u00e3o Paulo aren't usually dangerous, at least not more dangerous than an ordinary neighborhood. Still, some of them can be dangerous, so if you are in doubt, don't go or have the company of a local.\nAnd naturally, every safety recommendation that applies to big cities in general also applies to S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\nDon't trust strangers, especially those who seem excessively helpful;\nAlways prefer the help of an identified officer or employee to that of a stranger;\nWatch your belongings all the time in crowded streets or public transportation;\nBe careful with your phone on streets, young people on bicycles can snatch the phone from your hands, when you're inside your phone and aren't paying attention to what\u2019s happening around;\nAvoid withdrawing and carrying large amounts of money;\nAvoid using expensive clothes and jewelry that make you stand out.\n\n\nNatural disasters\nIn the summer, severe storms affect S\u00e3o Paulo and the potential for torrential rain, dangerous lightning, overflowing rivers and the possibility of flooding must be acknowledged.\n\n\nFootball (soccer)\nS\u00e3o Paulo is home to three major football teams in Brazil: Corinthians, Palmeiras and S\u00e3o Paulo FC. There is also a considerable number of Santos supporters. Minor teams include Portuguesa and Juventus.\nWearing one's favorite club's jersey as casual clothing is usual in S\u00e3o Paulo, even when it's not a match day. While walking by someone wearing a rival's jersey means nothing, being in the \"wrong\" place at the \"wrong\" time and with the \"wrong\" jersey during a match day may be extremely dangerous. For example, if you wear a S\u00e3o Paulo jersey and walk by a group of Corinthians supporters when the two clubs are about to face each other, they may provoke you. Some supporters go as far as to schedule street fights on the internet, so it's always best to avoid being near large agglomerations of supporters.\n\n\nTourist police stations\nFamiliarize yourself with the location of the police stations specializing in tourist service and protection. These stations offer information on public safety and are staffed with qualified professionals to meet your needs.\n\nHeadquarters of the Specialized Tourist Police \u2013 Deatur Delegacia Especializada em Atendimento ao Turista. R. Cantareira, 390. +55 11 3120-4417.\n\n\nStay healthy\nNo vaccination is required for S\u00e3o Paulo, unless you are planning to travel to central-western (Mato Grosso) or northern (Amazon) regions of Brazil afterwards, for which you should take a shot against yellow fever, and carry anti-malaria medication (quinine).\nIf you're arriving from Peru, Colombia or Bolivia, the vaccination of yellow fever is required only if you need a visa (i.e., if you are going to stay for longer than 90 days). Check the requirements of any country you will travel to from Brazil.\nTap water in S\u00e3o Paulo is generally safe, at least when straight from the water supply system. However, several buildings can be lacking in the periodic cleaning of their cisterns and water tanks (the locals themselves tend to avoid tap water and drink bottled or filtered water instead).\n\n\nCope\n\n\nElectricity\nIn the city of S\u00e3o Paulo the voltage is usually 127V, unlike many other parts of Brazil and even of the S\u00e3o Paulo state. Most electronic products sold in S\u00e3o Paulo are now bi-volt, but always check carefully.\n\n\nConsulates\n  Australia, Alameda Ministro Rocha Azevedo, 456, 2F, \u260f +55 11 2112-6200, fax: +55 11 2112-6220, consular.saopaulo@austrade.gov.au. 09:00-11:00. \n  Argentina, Ave Paulista, 2313 - sobreloja, \u260f +55 11 3897-9522, fax: +55 11 3285-0748, consarsp@terra.com.br. 09:00-17:00. \n  Canada, Ave Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unida, 12.901, 16F, \u260f +55 11 5509-4321, fax: +55 11 5509-4260, spalo-cs@international.gc.ca.
