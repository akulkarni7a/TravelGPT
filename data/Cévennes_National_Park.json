A stopover lodge and a snack bar managed by the municipality of Valleraugue welcome hikers and tourists from May to November.\nApart from hiking, the mountain is also known for cycling. It can be climbed by many slopes, due to the number of roads that converge in various places on the sides of the climb. The two steepest slopes are the one starting from L'Arboux or the Taleyrac valley via the Col de la Lusette (the latter being 17 kilometres at 6.6% on average), and that of Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Valborgne passing through the Salid\u00e8s pass and the Seixt valley but the Valleraugue slope, not very steep but very long (28 kilometres at 4.3%) is the most popular route taken.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\n1 Le Phenix, Col de Jalcreste, \u260f +33 4 66 32 46 03.
