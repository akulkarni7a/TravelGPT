  "extract": "Arlon (German and Luxembourgish: Arel, Dutch: Aarlen) is the capital of the southernmost Belgian province of Luxembourg. The town counts approximately 30,000 inhabitants and is often seen as the Belgian gate to the country of Luxembourg. Together with Tongeren and Tournai it is one of the oldest cities in Belgium.\n\n\nUnderstand\nArlon was founded due to its location at the crossing of the Roman roads connecting Reims, Trier and Cologne. During Roman times Arlon was called Orolaunum Vicus.\n\n1 Tourist Centre, Rue des Faubourgs 2, \u260f +32 63 21 94 54, info@ot-arlon.be. \n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nArlon is by train fairly easy accessible from the larger Belgian cities of Brussels, Li\u00e8ge and Namur.

The 1 Train Station is located about 300 meters south of the historical centre.\n\n\nBy car\nArlon is located right next to the E25 highway between Li\u00e8ge and the city of Luxembourg.

When arriving from Luxembourg it is more convenient to get off at the Longwy exit already.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe historical centre of Arlon is small and easily covered on foot.
