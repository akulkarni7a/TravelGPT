  "extract": "Dominica is a Caribbean island country. It is referred to as the \"Nature Island of the Caribbean\" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system.  The most mountainous island of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest thermally active lake in the world.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAdministrative divisions. 10 parishes: Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Joseph, Saint Luke, Saint Mark, Saint Patrick, Saint Paul, Saint Peter.\n\n\nClimate\nTropical; moderated by northeast trade winds; heavy rainfall.  Flash floods are a constant threat; destructive hurricanes can be expected during the late summer months and well into the fall.\n\n\nTerrain\nRugged mountains of volcanic origin. Highest point Morne Diablotin 1,447 m\n\n\nHistory\nDominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Kalinago people (called \"Caribs\" by Europeans). France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia Charles, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Kalinago Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.\n\n\nTourist information\nDominica\n\n\nTalk\nLanguages : English (official), French patois.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Roseau \u2014 Capital\n2 Portsmouth \u2014 The second largest town in Dominica.  Ross University, a large American medical school was situated nearby but moved to Barbados after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and has not yet returned.\n\n3 Scott's Head \u2014 Beautiful village at the end of the road on the southwest corner.  Scott's Head wraps around the lip of a gently curved bay that happens to be the ancient crater of a volcano.  Luckily for divers you can bring your own snorkel or scuba gear and walk out and admire what remains, a 160 meter deep coral lined hole that stretches for hundreds of meters.  Several quaint shacks serve decent fare for decent prices.  Villagers are curious as visitors are few.  The main road ends at a small point on a  hill that provides stunning views of both Scott's Head below and Roseau to the north.\n Calibishie \u2014 Stretching from the rugged mountains of Pennville, through the picturesque fishing village of Calibishie to the crashing surf of the Marigot beaches, the Calibishie Coast is one of the few areas in the world where you can travel from the seashore to the littoral forest to the rain forest in little more than a mile. Experience palm-fringed beaches, freshwater rivers with secluded bathing pools, tumbling waterfalls and the soft wonder of the rain forest with its exotic birds and lush vegetation, all in a days' walk.\n St. Joseph \u2014 Situated halfway up Dominica's West Coast, St. Joseph is one of the more urbanised villages on the island. Historically called \"Senjo,\" the village is known for its fishing, cricket playing and vibrant festivals. While not typically on the tourist trail, it is near the popular Mero Beach and Layou River. St. Joseph was featured in the 1988 Demi Moore movie, The Seventh Sign.\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Marigot (Dominica) Melville Hall\nHampstead (Dominica)\n\n2 Morne Trois Pitons National Park \u2014 A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it contains many attractions such as the Boiling Lake, the Freshwater Lake, Boeri Lake and Middleham Falls. Boiling Lake is a 12-mile round trip hike (8 hours), very steep mostly on steps and switchbacks.  A guide is recommended for inexperienced back country hikers, the terrain is rough especially when wet (which it almost always is).  The trail is well marked most of the way.  The trail is indistinct in the Valley of Desolation but picks up again where vegetation begins. The hike is stunning and the bare volcanic mountain tops make for unforgettable views of rolling mountain tops and steamy volcanic vents.  Trail ends at the Boiling Lake, a 100 meter wide lake that is being heated by a volcanic vent and is boiling.\nChampagne \u2014  A snorkelling spot on the southern coast, underwater volcanic vents emit continuous streams of bubbles making the place feel like a giant glass of champagne. The fish and coral are slightly below average.\nGlassy \u2014 An incredible and short 2-3 hour day hike in the southeast of the island.  The trail begins nicely enough through some farm land and then plunges into a deep jungle valley then approaches the coast skirting steep cliffs to one side (not for those with vertigo). The trail ends on an old volcanic flow that juts into the ocean, waves roll all around crashing on all sides, little ponds collect some of the water from the crashing waves and some coral and fish make the ponds their home.  When approaching the edges of the cliffs be aware waves have been known to throw people against the rocks or worse yet pulled them into the ocean to their certain death.\nJaco Steps \u2014  Ford the creek in Belles and hike into the a rain forest up the side of a nearly inaccessible forest plateau. In 30 minutes you will reach the Jaco Steps.  There is not a clear consensus of why these steps were constructed many decades ago. To do a circular route by following the river upstream will add an hour at least to your journey and will involve multiple crossings of the river en route.\nCentral Region \u2014  The lushly forested and hand-farmed central region is sparsely populated and considered by many to be the most beautiful region.  It consists of several villages:\nBelles\nPenrice\nDleau Gommier\nWet Area\nStone Hill\nJacco Estate: a rain forest with a few small farms, previously a coffee plantation, and prior to that, the headquarters of the Maroons.\n\n\nGet in\n\nThe following persons do not need a visa to enter into the Commonwealth of Dominica:\nPersons from the following countries wishing to enter into the Commonwealth of Dominica for a period not exceeding six months:\nMember States of the Commonwealth, CARICOM member states, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, United States of America;\nPersons from the following countries wishing to enter into the Commonwealth of Dominica for a period not exceeding three months: Argentina, Belgium, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, \nGreece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico\nNetherlands (including Netherland Antilles), Norway, People's Republic of China, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, United Kingdom and Venezuela\nPassengers on tourist vessels, or any in-transit passenger or bona fide tourist, who is in possession of a return ticket and satisfies the Immigration Officer that he/she does not intend to remain in Dominica for longer than 21 days, are also exempt from visa requirements.\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are two airports in Dominica, Melville Hall (Douglas\u2013Charles Airport) (DOM IATA) and Canefield (DCF IATA). Most commercial flights land at Melville Hall. However, the airport cannot accommodate jet aircraft.  The island can be accessed through San Juan,  Antigua, Barbados, St. Maarten, Martinique, Guadeloupe and other Caribbean hubs.\n\n\nBy boat\nThe most extensive official service is operated by Express des Isles, which runs services to Martinique and Guadeloupe ferries on most days of the week. Arrival in Roseau. E.g. one way to Martinique (July 2019) is \u20ac69 online + EC$86/US$33/\u20ac35 harbour tax payable in cash only at ferry terminal.\nCruise ships increasingly visit. A large pier serves many directly in front of the downtown area. If already occupied, ships dock at the industrial port about 1.5 miles away.\n\n\nGet around\nAs far as freedom of movement and exploration a car can be invaluable. Though small, the island's tightly turning mountain roads make for relatively long journeys and a hair-raising experience.  Driving is on the left hand side of the road and there are various car rental agencies at both airports.\n\nHonk horn on hairpin turns especially during the day.\nBeware of large trucks as their width forces other drivers off the road.\nWatch for large pot holes and crumbling asphalt as roads can be in very poor condition.\nAsk directions if lost, the locals are very friendly and informative.\nWhen in mountains in torrential rains, consider stopping for a bit or at least going very slowly.\nA compact is sufficient for most situations but a small 4x4 might also be nice.  A large 4x4 would be cumbersome on the small streets.\nOther travel options include bus or taxi. If you are on a low budget and have plenty of time then hitch-hiking or the bus will be fine (except on Sundays), although sitting in a bumpy bus for long trips on winding mountain roads is not the most comfortable thing to do. Taxi is more comfortable than the buses and may not be expensive, particularly if the fare is shared with 2 or more travellers. Whether you use the bus or taxi, make sure that you clearly agree to the destination and price before you start the trip.\n\n\nSee\n\nThis lush Caribbean island is called \"the nature island\" for a reason. Its beautiful, tropical natural riches are by far its main attraction. Where other Caribbean destinations pride themselves most on their white, palm-lined beaches, Dominica shows another side of the region. Head to the mountain village of Laudat for a hike through the UNESCO listed Morne Trois Pitons National Park. It encompasses some of the island's finest mountainous terrain in a 17,000-acre protected area. A proper hike will reward you with gorgeous misty lakes, waterfalls, rivers, hot springs and fumaroles in a setting of volcanoes and thick jungle. Enjoy the sight and take a swim at the Emerald Pool or explore the Titou Gorge.\nFrom the gorge, true hikers should set out for the challenging six-hour hike to the boiling lake, the second-largest of its kind in the world and an amazing sight.\nThe capital of Roseau is a pleasant place to explore, with many restaurants, small shops and wonderful views of the mountains (to the east) and the Caribbean Sea (to the west). The town hums with the sounds of vehicles, Caribbean accents, and minor commerce (e.g. sidewalk BBQs, vendors selling clothing in street stalls). Head to the Botanic Gardens to get away from the hussle or sip a coffee in a gallery.\nAn old British Fort is on the north-west coast at Portsmouth. A small fee may be charged. Expect to spend 1-2 hours at the site. A guided tour through the recreated village of Kalinago Barana Aut\u00ea in the Carib Territory gives an interesting insight in traditional Kalinago culture.\nScotts Head is a small isthmus on the southern tip of the island. It is also the name of the small community that is there. It takes about one hour to drive from Roseau each way. Scotts Head is a great place to hike up the steep outcrop, which offers a wonderful view of the south-west coast of Dominica and the Caribbean Sea (and even the island of Martinique to the south).\nThe Sisserou Parrot, best known as the Imperial Amazon, is endemic to Dominica. As a critically endangered species, it inhabits in mountain forests at 2,100 feet. The bird is the island's official national symbol and is featured on its national flag.\n\n\nDo\n\nSnorkelling is particularly good at Champagne, south of Roseau, and at Scott's Head. Scuba Diving, waterskiing, jet skiing, kayaking or other water sports are also possibilities. Note that kayaking or canoeing provide an alternative to the ocean and lets you experience the rivers and inland bodies of water throughout Dominica.\nWhale watching, dolphin watching, or boat tours can be arranged from Roseau.\n\n1 JC Ocean Adventures, Mero Village, Dominica, \u260f +1 767-449-6957. varies. US$50-750. \nDominica's waters are also home to three species of marine turtles (Leatherback, Hawksbill, and Green turtle), and these gentle giants can be seen coming in to nest on shore during the months of April to October. Protected viewing sites are set up throughout the island, such as at Mangrove Bay on the Woodford Hill beach in the north east, or on the beaches of Portsmouth in the north west.\nHiking trip, biking, ATV tours, or zip lining are popular in forest areas. Hiking is one of the best ways to see Dominica and there are many wonderful hikes around the island of easy to challenging.\n\n Middle Ham Falls. The waterfall is a wonderful reward at the end of this moderately difficult hike. Be careful on the trail as it can be a bit challenging in parts. The start of the trail is a fair distance north-east of Roseau so expect to spend about an hour driving each way. The hike may take about an hour each way. You'll want to spend at least 30 minutes enjoying your reward for the hike at the Middle Ham falls and pool. \n Valley of Desolation/ Boiling Lake. Make sure to leave yourself time to travel to/from this destination in addition to the lengthy and challenging hike. Expect to take an at least 8-hour long round trip (including driving) - but it's worth the effort. Stunning scenery. \nDominica rock climbing and canyoning is an encouraging and motivating experience. It tests strength and agility while experiencing some of the most breathtaking views of Dominica.\nDominica is known for their many island events and festivals. The Caribbean Islands love food, music, and celebration. Whether it\u2019s a cultural gathering or a music festival Dominica offers it.\nMany of Dominica\u2019s resorts offer spa vacation services on the premise for a convenient way to get rejuvenated for the next day of activities.\n\n The Kalinago Barana Aut\u00ea, \u260f +1 767 445 7979, kbamanager@cwdom.dm. Daily from 9AM to 5PM. This site shares history and traditions of the Kalinago people (caribs) from hundreds of years ago. It is located along the banks of the Crayfish-River near the Isukulati Falls in the Carib Territory of Dominica. The site consists of a reception center, snack bar and gift shops. To begin your tour, a footbridge crosses the river and gives way to a circular trail leading to a series of small huts throughout the village. There is a Karbet which is used for cultural and theatrical performances. Kalinago (carib) traditional activities at the village include canoe building, cassava processing, basket weaving and herb collection and preparation. The kalinagos (caribs) are the indigenous people of Dominica. Entrance fees are US$10 per person for a 30-45 minute guided tour. \n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency of the country is the East Caribbean dollar, denoted by the symbol: \"$\" or \"EC$\" (ISO currency code: XCD), which is also used by seven other island nations in the Caribbean. The EC dollar is subdivided into 100 cents. It is pegged to the United States dollar at an exchange rate of US$1 = EC$2.70.\nCoins circulate in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 25 cents and 1 dollar. Banknotes circulate in denominations of 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollars.\n\n\nShopping\n\nThe best local handicrafts are Kalinago-made baskets. The earth tone colors come from burying the fibers in the ground for different lengths of time. U.S. citizens (likely others) need to ensure that the materials from which they are made allow them to be taken back home.\nDominica is also well known for its music, so be sure to buy some local music while you are on the island. Genres range from jazz, reggae-dancehall, calypso & soca, to Cadence-lypso and Bouyon and which are popular Dominican genres. Visit during the last weekend in October and be treated to the World Creole Music Festival or if you can't make it, ask for the best local artistes, and be aware of pirated copies!\nMany kiosks and vendors line the shore at the main cruise ship dock. One excellent leather store faces the dock on the other side of the road.

Coconut water is cheap and readily available by the side of the road. Another local specialty is sorrel. This red refreshing drink is brewed from the flowers of a hibiscus species common also in Jamaica. The popular locally brewed beer is Kubuli.  Ask your hotel to set up a tour of the brewery.\nThere are many vendors of fruit juice in Roseau.  Almost without exception this is non-pasteurized fruit juice with water and sugar added.  The added water is usually chlorinated tap water. A juice vendor known as Pal sells his juice by the area where one can find a bus to Portsmouth.  Pal is one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable fruit vendors on the island.  He sometimes has juice from rare fruits.\nQuenchi is a local soft drink which comes in many different flavors. It can be found in every village (with diet varieties at the IGA in Roseau).\nSorrel, known as the Christmas drink for its red colour (and because it only flowers around Christmas) is made from boiled flowers. It tastes heavenly.\nAvocado pear juice can be purchased in some small cafes and is certainly worth a try. Other flavours include soursop, passionfruit, grapefruit, orange, lime, beetroot.\nThe coffee is usually not very good, as most locals seem to prefer tea and juice, with the occasional exception.
