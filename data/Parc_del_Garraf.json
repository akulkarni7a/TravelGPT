This arid expanse in the south-western Catalan coastal mountain range boasts captivating karstic formations, featuring caves, sinkholes, and limestone pavement.\n\n\nUnderstand\n  \nCovering 12,376 hectares in the El Garraf district, limestone rock dominates the landscape, adorning vineyard buildings and ancient farmhouses. Within the park's boundaries, nature and history entwine, creating a unique environment where the earth's very foundation tells an ancient tale. Explore the rich karstic shapes and the enchanting beauty of El Garraf Park.\nIn the park, you'll find remnants of ancient human occupation, such as the Erampruny\u00e0 Castle and the abandoned villages of Campd\u00e0sens and Jafre, as well as farmhouses that are still engaged in agricultural activities or providing services to the park, like Can Planes and La Pleta.

(updated Nov 2023)\n\n\nHistory\n\nGarraf, often seen as a remote and depopulated region, holds a complex history of human interaction. While signs of ancient habitation exist, it was in the 18th century that the population began to grow significantly, fostering extensive vineyards and wheat fields. However, the devastating phylloxera outbreak in 1879-1880 halted this agricultural prosperity. Presently, Garraf faces challenges such as quarries, shooting ranges, and waste sites, compounded by forest fires. Its designation as a natural park seeks to preserve its unique identity. Managed by the Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona, it's part of the Network of Natural Parks, promoting sustainable land use and responding to the need for educational activities and recreational facilities in the natural environment.\n\n\nLandscape\n\nThe Garraf Mountains, located in the southern part of the Serralada de Marina or Litoral, offer a unique and distinctive landscape. With low rounded reliefs, deep valleys, rocky walls, and sparse vegetation including maquis, holm oaks, pine forests, shrubs, and meadows, it creates a wild and arid atmosphere. The coastal location results in a typical Mediterranean climate with low but torrential spring and autumn rains, mild winters, and hot, dry summers, influencing the local flora and fauna. The limestone substrate has led to the formation of karstic features like caves, dolines, and sinkholes. Human activities such as agriculture and livestock have significantly shaped the landscape, but they have largely been abandoned, leaving the area susceptible to wildfires due to the accumulation of easily ignitable vegetation.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe Mediterranean holm oak forest is in regression in the Garraf region, occupying a significantly smaller area than in the past. Today, remnants of this ecosystem are found only in isolated locations in the northern mountains of Olesa and the Bruguers area, primarily in humid spots with deep soil. In some areas, it coexists with the kermes oak or boxwood. Other plant communities in Garraf include degraded evergreen oak woodlands with boxwood, fire-favored maquis, white pine forests (covering a significant part of the wooded area in the park), and the degraded coastal maquis. The landscape is influenced by new activities and infrastructure, such as urbanization, residential tourism, quarries, landfills, radars, antennas, and power lines, resulting in deforested areas.\nThe harsh environmental conditions, characterized by intense sunlight, water scarcity, limited vegetation, and rugged terrain, support a unique fauna adapted to these peculiar conditions. Notable bird species in the area include the blue rock thrush, black wheatear, Rock Bunting, and woodlark, as well as endangered raptors like the peregrine falcon and Bonelli's eagle. The coastal slopes provide opportunities for marine birds, including the recent establishment of the shag colony. The ecological transition between holm oak forests and Mediterranean maquis and kermes oak is also reflected in the herpetofauna, with species ranging from the thermophilic North African horseshoe snake and Iberian worm lizard to the Central European fire salamander and common wall lizard. Moreover, the extensive karst system in the region has allowed the development of fascinating subterranean life, including unique endemic species found nowhere else in the world.\n\n\nClimate\nThe coastal location defines a typically Mediterranean climate with limited but heavy spring and autumn rains, mild and temperate winters, and hot, dry summers. This last characteristic limits the number of animal species capable of establishing themselves. To withstand these conditions, plants have developed a series of adaptations aimed at survival and improving their effectiveness in competing with other vegetation.\nThe torrential nature of the rains causes an exceptionally powerful mechanical erosion that carries all kinds of materials. When combined with chemical erosion that dissolves the limestone rock, the effect is impressive: deep and steep valleys and streams with a winding and beautiful course that locals refer to as \"fondos\".\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nAP-7 (exits 28, 29, and 30)\nC-32 (exits 21 to 48)\nC-31 (exits from Gav\u00e0 to Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa)\nC-15 (exits from Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa to Vilafranca del Pened\u00e8s)\nN-340 (exits from Avinyonet del Pened\u00e8s to Vilafranca del Pened\u00e8s)\nBV-2041 (from Gav\u00e0 to Begues)\nBV-2111 (from Sant Pere de Ribes to Olivella)\nBV-2411 (from Begues to Aviny\u00f3 Nou)\n\n\nBy rail\nRenfe.

In 1875, the Ravent\u00f3s family sold the old farmhouse Plana Novella to Pere Domen\u00e8ch i Grau, a resident of Cuba. The new owner included his possessions under the benefits of the colonial law, obtaining an exemption from consumption tax and other services for the families living there. The construction of the palace was completed on October 29, 1890. The owners only enjoyed it for six years because they went bankrupt due to the phylloxera outbreak in 1893. As a result, the estate was put up for public auction in 1896. Since then, the palace has had different owners who kept its doors closed until 1996 when a Buddhist community moved in, restoring the building and establishing a museum.

Its strategic significance in the defensive system between Al-Andalus and the Carolingian Empire made it a key political, economic, and military center. Despite facing destruction during the Catalan Civil War in 1469, it witnessed a succession of owners and was eventually acquired in the late 19th century by banker Manel Girona, a figure associated with the completion of Barcelona Cathedral's fa\u00e7ade.

The remnants include the Baron of Jafra's residence, the farmhouse, and the Church of Santa Maria de Jafre, along with its rectory, dating back to the early 14th century. Documented since 1139, Jafre received significant attention in the 17th century when the Barons sought to rejuvenate the village, appointing a mayor in 1683 and restoring the church. In 1819, Jafre became part of Olivella due to parish ties. Traditionally focused on firewood and pastures, vine cultivation thrived until the phylloxera epidemic (1879-1880) led to gradual abandonment. As of 1960, Jafre was left with 19 inhabitants.
