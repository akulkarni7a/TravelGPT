  "extract": "Saint-Denis is a suburb (banlieue) just north of Paris.  \nThe martyred saint was said to have been beheaded in Paris, yet miraculously picked up his own head, washed it and walked nearly 10 km north to his future namesake village.  In Paris, you can see his headless statue by the main door of Notre Dame and his headless portrait in the mosaic of Sacre Coeur.\nThe city grew around the Basilica of Saint Denis, where his relics are stored.\n\n\nGet in\nTo get to Saint-Denis, take the M\u00e9tro 13 (light blue) and head north: the terminal is St. Denis Universit\u00e9, but get off one stop before at Basilique de Saint-Denis.  No additional fare is required.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\nBasilique de Saint-Denis, 2, rue de Strasbourg (M\u00e9tro Basilique Saint-Denis), +33 1 48 13 14 73. Open daily 10am to 5:15pm.

With an average of 150 criminal incidents per 1,000 inhabitants since 2005, Saint-Denis is known as one of the least safe places in France, so avoid getting lost, especially at night. The risk of aggravated assaults and muggings are some of the highest in Europe. \nThe areas immediately surrounding the Stade de France have somewhat improved over the last few years, and there is a decent police presence during the day. Otherwise do stay on your guard at night and do not stray away from crowds.\n\n\nGo next",
