  "extract": "Ingolstadt is a city in Upper Bavaria, southern Germany, best known for being home to the car company Audi. It was here that the dukes of Bavaria, Wilhelm IV and Ludwig X, announced the Reinheitsgebot brewing purity order in 1516, which is still used heavily in marketing for German beer.\n\n\nUnderstand\nAlthough it counts over 138,000 residents (2018) today, some people still call it a village, since it can't keep up with the big city charm of  Munich or Nuremberg. Ingolstadt is known for hosting the first Bavarian university and having large military fortress facilities. The latter is the reason, why many citizens of Ingolstadt still call themselves Schanzer (from verschanzen: to fortify). It is also the city, where Adam Weishaupt - a professor at Ingolstadt University - founded the Illuminati, and the popular novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is set. However, Shelly made a mistake in that she did not account for the fact that the University of Ingolstadt had already moved to Landshut by the time her book was written in 1808. The university moved again in 1826 and is now known as Ludwig Maximilian's University Munich. Ingolstadt is also the home of the headquarters of the car manufacturer Audi.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nMunich Airport (MUC IATA) is 70 km (45 mi) south of the city and the closest international airport. By train Munich Central Station (M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof) is about 35 min by ICE high-speed train or 60 min by local train away from Ingolstadt and the journey costs approximately \u20ac17. Since one has to go there first by suburban train (S-Bahn) line S1, which takes approx. 50 min, and then change there to get on a train to Ingolstadt, it is a lot quicker and more convenient to take the bus. If you are a party of up to 5 people and travel on a tight budget, though, you may consider taking the train, as there exists a cheap ticket (Bayernticket) for \u20ac25 (+\u20ac4 for every extra person up to a party of 5), which is valid for the S-Bahn, the train and also some buses. However you can not take an ICE or IC train with that ticket!\nFrom Munich Airport there is a bus called \"Airport Express X109\". A one-way ticket is \u20ac19 and a return ticket \u20ac31. The bus takes about an hour to the centre of Ingolstadt, stopping there at the central bus station (ZOB). It leaves every 90 min between 05:15 and 00:15 at Terminal 2, level E03, passing by Terminal 1, area A/B three minutes later and at Munich Airport Center (MAC) another four minutes later. More information can be obtained here.\nNuremberg Airport (NUE IATA) is 100 km (62 mi) north of Ingolstadt, so also rather close by and can be reached easily by train and subway. From the airport you take the subway  U2  to N\u00fcrnberg Hbf (Central Station). The ride takes some 13 min. There you change to a train (another 40 min ride to Ingolstadt).\n\n1 Ingolstadt Manching Airport (IGS  IATA). Mostly a military airport, it does have a civilian section and is used for general aviation as well as flights by VW and Audi between Ingolstadt and Wolfsburg   (updated Mar 2019)\n\n\nBy train\nOne of Ingolstadt's biggest selling points is its location along the Nuremberg-Ingolstadt high speed rail line where trains reach 300 km/h (190 mph) and it's thus within convenient commuting distance of both Munich and Nuremberg.\n\n2 Ingolstadt Hauptbahnhof (HBF). As the name implies, this is by far the most important station in town and it sees ICE service among others   \n3 Ingolstadt Nord. This is a secondary station with mostly regional service. It is slightly closer to the historical old town than the main station   \n\n\nBy car\nIngolstadt is located on autobahn A 9 about halfway between Munich and Nuremberg with the exits Ingolstadt Nord (61) and Ingolstadt S\u00fcd (62).\n\n\nBy bus\n4 Ingolstadt intercity bus station\nFlixbus serves Ingolstadt mostly stopping close to the Nordbahnhof.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\nIngolstadt has a decent bus network, which is operated by the INVG (Ingolst\u00e4dter Verkehrsgesellschaft). All parts of the town and most of the surrounding villages are reachable. During the day (05:00-21:00) you can catch a bus every 15-60 min. During the night, the service is reduced and special night lines, recognizable by the letter N proceeding their number, are employed.\n\n\nBy taxi\nMost taxis are organized by the Ingolstadt Taxi Central Office, where you can order a car by phone (+49 841 19410). Most of the drivers speak at least fragments of English and should know most of the hotels, clubs and other points of interest in the city by name. However, during the weekend night party rush hours, you will have a hard time getting a taxi by phone or on a taxi stand, especially when you try to get out of the city. In the latter case, try to move to the outskirts of the city in the direction of your destination. Most of the taxis will try to go back into the city and you have a bigger chance to intercept these on the outskirts than in the centre. And even if you don't get one, you're better off making pace in your direction than standing in the city centre and waiting. You can get to most places in town for about \u20ac10-15. The drivers are usually able to estimate the price quite well, but are legally required to charge exactly according to the price meter, calibrated by local authorities. When you leave the so-called Pflichtfahrgebiet (area where the driver is obligated to accept passengers), which covers the town and some of the surrounding villages, you can negotiate a price with the driver.\n\n\nBy bike\nA very good way to get around in Ingolstadt is to use a bike. Most of the main streets have bicycle lanes and you are able to get through parks and other areas you would have to go around by car. Remember to set up your bike for traffic safety, though, (especially with working front and back lights) and strictly follow traffic regulations. Bavarian police officers are very fussy about that. Getting a \u20ac100 fine for driving on red lights with your bike in the middle of nowhere without anyone around except for the police man 500 m (550 yd) behind you is common.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nHistorical buildings\n\nAll the historic buildings are found in or near the historical city centre and are within walking distance of one another.\n\n1 Herzogskasten, Hallstra\u00dfe 2 (City centre).

Hidden in the narrow streets of the historic city centre, this is a jewel of baroque art, especially the fresco on the ceiling. \u20ac2. \n5 Old City Hall (Altes Rathaus), Rathausplatz 2 (City centre). Dating back to the 14th century, this building was created by fusing different buildings into one in 1882. It is the seat of the mayor and - what might be of interest to a traveller even more - the city's tourist information. \n6 Reduit Tilly and Klenzepark, Br\u00fcckenkopf 2 (south shore of the river Danube). South of the inner city, on the right side of the river Danube, lies the Reduit Tilly, the core building of the classical Br\u00fcckenkopf (Bridge Head) fortress. You can visit the World War I exhibition of the Bavarian Army Museum inside or take a walk around the surrounding park area (Klenzepark). \n7 St. Moritz Church, Moritzstra\u00dfe 4 (Next to the Old City Hall), \u260f +49 821 3479860. Dating back to 1234, this church is the oldest building in Ingolstadt.  \n\n\nMuseums\n8 Audi Forum and Museum Mobile, Ettinger Stra\u00dfe 62, \u260f +49 841 8937575, welcome@audi.de.

The Reduit Tilly, a part of the former state fortress in Klenzepark hosts a World War I exhibition. The latter is a very interesting and well structured museum, with exhibits and documents from the era and some short films which summarise the history. The Army Museum is being renovated in 2019, so some parts may be closed. Many of the captions are in German and they have something of a pro-Bavarian and politically conservative slant but the original exhibits are interesting even if you don't subscribe to their view of history. \u20ac3.50, \u20ac1 (on Sundays), under 18 years free.   \n10 German Medical History Museum (Deutsches Medizinhistorisches Museum), Anatomiestra\u00dfe 18-20 (city centre), \u260f +49 841 3052860, dmm@ingolstadt.de. 10:00\u201317:00 (closed Mondays).

May/Jun & Sep/Oct. Ingolstadt has two traditional Bavarian beer festivals (think Oktoberfest in small) lasting ten days each. The first and bigger one starts the Friday before Pentecost and is therefore known as the Pfingstfest. Herbstfest (autumn festival), the second one, starts on the Friday before the last Sunday in September, running in parallel to the second week of Oktoberfest. You can find beer tents, food, rides, games and stalls. It is a bit more traditional than Oktoberfest and not as bustling, but in the evenings (especially on Friday and Saturday) the beer tents become full blown party areas. \n5 Barthelmarkt, Barthelmarktstra\u00dfe 8, 85077 Manching (leave the city by car to the south via B13 or even better take the special bus line). Last weekend of August. Even bigger than Ingolstadt's own beer festivals is the Barthelmarkt (St. Bartholomew market) in the village of Oberstimm, just south of Ingolstadt. Built as a horse market, it is now the biggest beer festival in the region, with its four beer tents being jam packed from early morning to late night. It happens on the last weekend in August, including Friday and Monday. Monday morning's horse market is the traditional highlight of the event. \n6 Adventszauber (Christkindlmarkt). 23 Nov-23 Dec: Su-Th 10:00-20:00, F 10:00-21:00.

The heart is traditional Christkindlmarkt (Christmas Market), with wooden stalls selling food, Christmas gimmicks, Gl\u00fchwein (lit. \"glowing wine\", warm seasoned wine) and other things, a merry-go-round and a story-teller. Another highlight is the outdoor ice skating rink in front at Paradeplatz. (updated Feb 2018)\n7 Classical music open air, Klenzepark. July. Each summer Audi sponsors a series of classic music concerts, with the classical music open air being the arguable highlight. For a weekend in July, a stage is built onto the large lawn in the Klenzepark. The Georgian Chamber Orchestra and the Audi Wind Orchestra each play one evening.
