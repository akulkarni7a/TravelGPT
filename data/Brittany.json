  "extract": "Brittany (French: Bretagne, Breton: Breizh) is a diverse region in northwestern France and a historic country with a distinct identity, sharing much of its Celtic heritage with Cornwall and Wales, mostly known internationally for its cr\u00eapes.\n\n\nRegions\n\nThere are two regions in Brittany, which are culturally different (language, habits, dances, food, etc.):\n\n\nDepartments\nFurthermore, the region is subdivided into four administrative departments:\n\nThe department of Loire-Atlantique, which has been in Pays de la Loire since the 1950s, is historically and culturally related to Brittany, and the castle of Brittany's dukes is in Nantes.\n\n\nCities\n\n\nUpper Brittany\n\n1 Rennes \u2014 The capital of Upper Brittany, a region with a unique Celtic past and culture.\n2 Dinan \u2014 A medieval town popular with tourists because of its picturesque timber houses, ramparts and stone walls\n3 Dinard \u2014 Regarded as one of the most prestigious seaside resorts in all of France with its international film festival, villas, sumptuous hotels, casino and an airport\n4 Lamballe \n5 Montfort-sur-Meu \u2014 A destination of frequent pilgrimages\n6 Paimpol\n7 Saint-Malo \u2014 Once the heavily fortified base of pirates and nowadays one of the top tourist draws\n8 Saint-Brieuc\n9 Vitr\u00e9 \u2014 Designated a ville d'art et d'histoire, a town of artistic and historic significance\n\n10 Nantes \u2014 Not part of any of the regions departments, but is often considered a part of Brittany, with Breton influences, and is just at its southeastern side\n\n\nLower Brittany\n\n11 Brest \u2013 The quasi-capital of Lower Brittany and city with the largest tides\n12 Concarneau \u2013 An old city, built by Vauban\n13 Carnac \u2013 The megalithic menhirs, stones erected by the prehistoric peoples of Brittany\n14 Douarnenez \u2013 A historical sardine-fishing and canning town\n15 Lorient \u2013 Famous for its yearly Festival Interceltique, dedicated to Celtic music with participants from all of the Celtic nations\n16 Pontivy \u2013 Popular for its castle and the Napoleonic heritage trail\n17 Quiberon\n18 Quimper \u2013 Capital of Finist\u00e8re and famous for its Quimper faience, a type of white glazed pottery\n19 Roscoff \u2013 A characteristically Breton city\n20 Vannes \u2013 A city in the golf of Morbihan\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Broc\u00e9liande \u2013 Arthurian forest\n2 Lac de Guerl\u00e9dan  \u2013 An artificial lake created by EDF (an electricity utility), a scenic highlight of interior Brittany\n3 C\u00f4te d\u2019\u00c9meraude  \u2013 A verdant rocky coast stretching from St Malo to St Brieuc\u2014bustling resorts, and charming fishing villages\n4 Monts d'Arr\u00e9e  \u2013 A mountainous area in Finist\u00e8re, with heathland\n5 Tr\u00e9gor \u2013 One of the nicest provinces of Brittany, with the following towns:\n21 Lannion \u2013 Has a cute center\n22 Pleumeur-Bodou \u2013 Famous for its space and telecommunications museum and bronze-age gallery graves.\nMinor towns around Montfort-sur-Meu in the Ille-et-Vilaine department with an article on Wikivoyage:\n23 B\u00e9d\u00e9e\n24 Breteil\n25 Iffendic\n26 La Nouaye\n27 Saint-Gonlay\n28 Talensac\n\n\nBreton islands\n6 Batz\n7 Belle \u00cele\n8 Br\u00e9hat\n9 Groix \n10 Ho\u00ebdic \n11 Houat\n12 Ile-aux-Moines\n13 Les Sept \u00celes \n14 Mol\u00e8ne\n15 Ushant \n\n\nUnderstand\n\nTowards the end of the 4th century, some of the Celtic Britons from what is now Wales and southern England began to emigrate to the Armorican Peninsula. Indeed the \"Great\" in Britain was added to differentiate it from the \"Little\" Britain on the mainland. The region received its modern name - Brittany (Breizh in Breton, Bretagne in French) from these settlers. With them they brought their own customs, tradition, and language that were completely different from that of their neighbors.\nAs a result of their unique cultural identity, Breton history became a long struggle for independence, at first from the Franks (5th to 9th centuries), that led to a Breton kingdom. After Viking invasions the kingdom became a duchy. The influence of the Counts of Anjou and the Dukes of Normandy was important from the 10th to 12th centuries, and finally the duchy was under the influence of England and France. Brittany was united with the Kingdom of France in 1532 as a province governed as if it were a separate nation under the crown.\nJacques Cartier was a Breton sea captain who explored parts of what is now Canada in the 1530s and 40s.\nThe Breton people maintain a fierce sense of independence to this day, as displayed by their local customs and traditions. In 1914, over 1 million people spoke Breton which equates to 90% of the population of the western half of Brittany. In 1945, it was about 75%, and today, in all of Brittany, at most 20% of Bretons can speak Breton.\nSince the 1970s, a resurgence of regional identity has happened in Brittany. Breton art, music and culture are recognized across France. It is quite common to see the Breton flag at all events, but also abroad.\n\n\nTalk\n\nBeing a part of France, French is universally spoken and understood by almost all locals in Brittany. \nIn Lower Brittany, many people also speak the Breton language, a Celtic language closely related to Cornish and Welsh, more distantly to Irish, and very different from French. On the road you may notice signs in both French and Breton.\nWhile France tried to discourage the use of regional languages, their use is rebounding, bringing a stronger understanding of culture, contributions, and history. Through the local efforts of the Bretons and their Breton language schools (Diwan, Div Yezh, Dihun), children are being taught in the native language while they learn standard curriculum. The schools are supported by worldwide efforts through various groups, including the International Committee for the Defense of the Breton Language.\nIn Upper Brittany, the Gallo language is sometimes spoken, which is a langue d'o\u00efl language (like French) and influenced by Breton.\nDue to its proximity to the British Isles, many people working in the tourism industry can also speak English. Some British and Irish people also live in Brittany, especially in the countryside.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy boat\nFrom various destinations:\n\nChannel Islands \u2013 Direct ferries from Jersey and Guernsey to Saint-Malo\nIreland \u2013 Cork to Roscoff\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 Plymouth to Roscoff and Portsmouth to Saint-Malo\nOne of the main services is Brittany Ferries, which operates the following regular services:\n\nPlymouth-Roscoff\nPoole-Cherbourg\nPortsmouth-St Malo\nPortsmouth-Ouistreham (Caen)\nRoscoff-Cork\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are airports in Brittany with scheduled flights:\n\nBretagne Airport (BES IATA) in Brest, served by Ryanair and Hop! - Air France\nSouth Brittany Airport (LRT IATA) near Lorient, with flights from Porto and Paris\nCornouaille Airport (UIP IATA) in Quimper\nSaint-Jacques Airport (RNS IATA) in Rennes, a minor international airport with direct flights from numerous French cities, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Spain\nArmor Airport (SBK IATA) in Saint-Brieuc, with Channel island flights\nAtlantique Airport (NTE IATA) in Nantes, is not in the region but it's close enough to be a convenient hub\n\n\nBy train\nThe TGV train runs almost hourly from Paris Montparnasse to Rennes, and then Brest, Quimper, Lannion and Saint-Malo\u2014see the SNCF website. Some TGVs run from Lille (Eurostar connexion to London), Strasbourg, Lyon and Marseille to Rennes. There are a few TGVs that connect Rennes to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport every day. \nRegional trains also link Rennes to Nantes (via Redon or through the Pays de la Loire).\n\n\nBy car\nMajor road axis exists in the region :\n\nN12 - Non-tolled road linking Paris to Brest via. Foug\u00e8res, Rennes and Saint-Brieuc\nA11 - Tolled motorway running from Paris to Rennes, also named the Oc\u00e9ane Route\nA84 - Non-tolled motorway running from Rennes to Caen, the N12 merges into it between Foug\u00e8res and Rennes\nN137 - Dual carriageway runs from Rennes to Nantes\nTo be noted, the tolled motorway A10 links Paris to Bordeaux via Nantes\n\n\nBy bus\nBus companies offer bus services from and to all major rail stations in Brittany. \n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\nThroughout Brittany, all roads are free (no tolls).\n\n\nBy train\nTrains are an easy way to visit Brittany, except for the center of the peninsula. There is no difference between TGV high-speed train and regional trains (TER) in Brittany\u2014both run at the same speed, and regional trains are usually cheaper and as comfortable as TGVs.\nThe main regional train lines are from Rennes to Brest, Quimper, Lannion and Saint-Malo. There is also some regional services from Rennes to Nantes, and from Brest to Quimper, Quimper to Nantes, Saint-Brieuc to Dinan, Dinan to Dol-de-Bretagne. Depending on the hour, some trains have few stops, some others stop everywhere. \nRegional trains are operated by the local authority. Trains, buses and some boats are operated in conjunction, often with convenient schedules for connections and combined tickets. At some hours during week days and on Saturdays, round-trips are half price (you don't pay for the way back). More information at https://www.breizhgo.bzh/en\n\n\nBy bus\nRegional buses are operated by the local authority but are under a single BreizhGo brand, so as regional trains and some boats. Buses are the best way to reach the center of Brittany where no train service exists. All these services are operated in conjunction, often with convenient schedules for connections and combined tickets. https://www.breizhgo.bzh/en\n\n\nSee\nMenhirs and Dolmens \u2013 Brittany has a large number of megaliths, which simply means \"big rocks\". These menhirs (standing stones) and dolmens (stone tables) were sites for burials and worship. See some magnificent examples at the bay of Morlaix and the gulf of Morbihan. Museums at Vannes and Carnac detail the archaeological finds made at these sites.\n\nCoastal Brittany\nCote de Granit Rose \u2013 The beautiful Pink Granite Coast offers an abundance of beautiful vistas, ranging from amazing pink granite outcrops through to gloriously sandy beaches.\nCote d'\u00c9meraude \u2013 Saint-Malo, Cancale and Dinard\nReligious buildings - Lot of churches, chapels, calvaries.\nGardens \u2013 Brittany has exceptionally beautiful gardens, see Remarkable Gardens of France\nThe chateau des Rohan in Josselin\nNantes-Brest Canal\n\n\nDo\nParticipate in a fest-noz \u2013 Breton for \"night fest\" are dancing sessions open to everyone, where people learn to dance traditional dances from Brittany, usually from 18:00-02:00. It will cost you from nothing to \u20ac8 to participate (most of them have a \u20ac6 fee). More globally, Breton people tend to dance when they hear traditional music so you may see people dancing in the street.\nHiking \u2013 there are many places where to hike\nPays de Montfort \u2013 A natural and hiking destination between Rennes and the forest of Broc\u00e9liande.\nMonts d'Arr\u00e9e \u2013 the mountainous area in Finist\u00e8re, a very preserved place with a lot of natural paths in preserved and diverse countryside\nBiking\nCanals and some rivers have been used as communication paths since centuries. They all offer a nice way to bike in Brittany. You can go from Rennes to Dinan, Rennes to Redon and then Nantes or the Atlantic Ocean. The longest bike path on a canal is on the Nantes-Brest Canal from Redon to the Ch\u00e2teaudun: you literary cross Brittany east to west.\nMusic festivals \u2013 There are plenty of festivals in Brittany, some of which are huge and have an international audience (Transmusicales, Vieilles Charrues, Festival du Bout du Monde, Festival Interceltique, etc.).\nSwim \u2013 Brittany is famous for beaches and\n\n\nEat\nBy far the foods that Brittany is most known for are cr\u00eapes and galettes  among the regional specialities, that you can eat on the numerous cr\u00eaperies you can find in quite every places.\n\nKig ha farz \u2013 meat and stuffing\nCoquilles Saint-Jacques \u2013 famous in Saint-Brieuc\nMussels and oysters \u2013 famous in Cancale\nCr\u00eapes made from wheat flour, they are eaten in Lower Brittany\nGalettes made from buckwheat flour are traditionally eaten in Upper Brittany\nGalette-saucisse \u2013 a grilled sausage rolled onto a fresh galette, traditional snack in Ille-et-Vilaine, you can buy some in markets or at sportive events\nGalette compl\u00e8te \u2013 a galette filled with ham, cheese and an egg.\nTourteaux (large crabs) and spider crabs\nFar breton \u2013 cake made with prunes and eggs\nKouign amann \u2013 butter cake, served lukewarm\nGalette (biscuit) \u2013 butter sweet biscuit from Lower Brittany, not the same as galette from Upper Brittany\nHam and pork products\nArtichokes and cauliflowers\n\n\nDrink\nCider (cidre) \u2013 Like Normandy, Brittany is cider country. Much like wine, cider comes in different varieties that are intended for different purposes, so you should pay attention to the following words on the label. Doux indicates a sweet cider, with a strong apple flavour and low alcohol percentage (3% or below), that is best drunk with dessert or by itself. Demi-sec / brut is sharper and fresher, with an alcohol content of between three and five percent. This kind of cider is more common as an ap\u00e9ritif, or as an accompaniment to local cuisine, especially seafood. Unlike in certain other countries, notably the United States, cider in Brittany is always alcoholic and always sparkling (p\u00e9tillant). A map of the producers (in French) is here\nPerry (poir\u00e9) \u2013 Similar to cider, but made from pears. Production is considerably limited compared to its apple-based counterpart.\nChouchen \u2013 Breton mead, a sweet alcohol made from fermented honey, water and yeast\nBeer \u2013 There is a great variety (some of them are made with sea water)\nWhisky \u2013 There are Breton whiskies. Nevertheless, there are better ones in the Gaelic world.\nKir Breton \u2013 The local adaptation of the kir. You pour Breton cider instead of white wine, preferably from the Rance valley. (Kir, for those uninitiated, is blackcurrant liqueur and white wine.)\nButtermilk (lait ribot)\n\n\nStay safe\nWhen swimming in the sea, watch out for rips and undercurrents, like in the Golfe du Morbihan. Be mindful that the tide can come at a very fast pace so watch out or you might be stranded on an outlying island! Check the tides (mar\u00e9es) in your local tourist office. Ask for a table of the tides.\nWhen it comes to personal safety, Brittany is fairly safe for the most part. Some larger urban areas like Rennes and Brest have their share of pickpocketing and muggings, but besides those, one can travel stress-free throughout the region.\n\n\nGo next\nChannel Islands, i.e. Guernsey and Jersey\nMont Saint Michel \u2013 In Normandy, but very close to the Brittany border; monastery and town built on a tiny outcrop of rock in the sand, which is cut off from the mainland at high tide (and then joined to the continent by a light bridge; cars and buses can no longer pass or park near the Mont, but there's a transport system with light buses). It is one of France's major tourist destinations, and as such gets very busy in high season. Check the times of the tides before you visit!",
