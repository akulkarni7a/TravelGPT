  "extract": "The Axe historique, the Historical Axis, or the Voie Triomphale, is a nearly straight route through French capital Paris, passing by most of the city's important buildings and monuments.\nIt runs from La Bastille in the 4th arrondissement along the northern bank of the Seine at the Louvre in the 1st, along the Avenue des Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es in the 8th, ending at the Grand Arch of La D\u00e9fense, in the city's northwestern outskirts.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es was created in the 17th century. It has been extended westwards through the Avenue de la Grande Arm\u00e9e, and the Avenue Charles De Gaulle, to the skyscraper complex in La D\u00e9fense, commissioned in the 1950s.\n\n\nGo\nThe axis is in total 10 km long, from La Bastille to La D\u00e9fense. For travellers who want to complete the whole itinerary, a bicycle or a scooter would be useful. Most of the landmarks are within the 4.5 km between H\u00f4tel de Ville and Place Charles de Gaulle; walkable within 1-2 hours, depending on pace.\nMetro Line 1 follows the whole axis from the Bastille to La D\u00e9fense.\nWhile the route can be done by car, sightseeing by car in Paris is discouraged.\n\nSee the district articles for complete information on the following attractions:\n\n\n4th arrondissement\nSee also: Paris/4th arrondissement\nThe 4th arrondissement contains many of Paris' oldest buildings. As there is not much left to see of la Bastille, the H\u00f4tel de Ville is a good place to start.\n\n1 la Bastille (Metro: Bastille). Make your way to the Bobigny/Pablo Picasso-bound platform. All that's left of the fortress are some foundation stones on the platform. There are maps and explanations showing where the fortress used to be relative the place and surroundings.   \n2 Maison de Victor Hugo, 6, Place des Vosges (Metro: Saint-Paul, Chemin Vert, or Bastille, Bus 20, 29, 65, 69, 96). The house in which the famous French novelist Victor Hugo once lived. Free.   \n3 H\u00f4tel de Sully, 62 rue Saint-Antoine (Metro: Saint-Paul or Bastille, Bus 69, 76, 96). Built in 1625, the Hotel de Sully is an interesting house with some sculptures in a beautiful courtyard. The house features special exhibitions, so check listings when in Paris.   \n4 M\u00e9morial de la Shoah (The Holocaust Memorial), 17, rue Geoffroy l\u2019Asnier. Opened in January 2005, the Holocaust Memorial comprises a major documentation centre and a wall bearing 76,000 names of Jews deported from France to the Nazi camps between 1942-1944. Includes an archive of a million artefacts, including 55,000 photographs. Excursions are run from the memorial to French internment camp sites such as Drancy. Admission free.   \n\n5 H\u00f4tel de Ville (Town Hall), Place de la H\u00f4tel de Ville (Metro: H\u00f4tel de Ville). Many feel that this, Paris' town hall, is one of the loveliest buildings in the city. You might not get that from the front view, but try watching the light change on its roofs and towers during sunset from one of the caf\u00e9s on the Ile de St. Louis, the Lutece for instance. Alternatively, go to the top floor of the Bazar de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville (BHV) department store opposite, on rue de Rivoli and walk up a flight of stairs to the roof terrace, from which there is a dramatic view of both the roof of the H\u00f4tel de Ville and the immediate surroundings and river. The present H\u00f4tel de Ville replaced the 16th century original which was burned down in 1871. A pastiche of its predecessor, but on a far larger scale, it was designed by the architects Ballu and Deperthes, and was mostly completed by 1882. The building is finished in an arrestingly white stone, similar to that used for the even more eye-catching Sacr\u00e9-Coeur basilica. The statue on the garden wall on the south side is of Etienne Marcel, the most famous holder of the post of \"prev\u00f4t des marchands\" (provost of merchants) which pre-dated the office of mayor.   \n6 Tour St Jacques, Rue de Rivoli (M\u00e9tro: Chatelet). A Gothic church tower in a square 150m to the west of the H\u00f4tel de Ville was restored by Ballu. It is all that remains of Eglise Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, which was the meeting place in Paris for pilgrims heading to Santiago de Compostela. As such it is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.   \n\n7 Centre Georges Pompidou, Place George Pompidou (Metro: Rambuteau). Those who are unfamiliar with Modernist and Post-Modern art sometimes don't know quite what to expect, or how to approach it. Such travellers should rest assured that the curators at the Pompidou Centre have assembled a marvellous introduction consisting of mostly approachable works which delight, amuse, and entertain. The art is far from the only reason for a visit, as the building also contains a vast public library and a fine restaurant (run by the Costes brothers) on the roof. In fact the place is literally surrounded by some of the nicest pavement caf\u00e9s in the city, in its superb location between the car-free above ground part of Forum Les Halles and the Marais art district.   \n8 Notre-Dame de Paris (Notre Dame Cathedral), Ile de la Cit\u00e9 6, Place du Parvis Notre Dame (Metro: St Michel), info@cathedraleDeParis.com. The early Gothic Cath\u00e9drale de Notre Dame has a 12th-century design but wasn't completed until the 14th. Still it is a good example of the development of the style, though the west or main portal is a bit unusual in its rigidity. Remember that this is an active church, there may even be a mass going on. Meanwhile anybody who's interested in history should check out the crypt. You enter at the opposite end of the square, where you can observe the foundation stones for buildings on the island going back to Roman times.   \n\n\n1st arrondissement\nSee also: Paris/1st arrondissement\nThrough the 1st arrondissement, travellers can follow La Seine, or La Rue de Rivoli, which run on either side of Le Louvre, and the Jardin des Tuileries to Place de la Concorde.\n\n9 La Conciergerie (Cit\u00e9  4 ). The ancient medieval fortress and prison of the city's island, site of some remarkable medieval royal architecture and the scene of Marie Antoinette's imprisonment in the period leading to her execution in 1793; lots of revolutionary associations.   \n10 Sainte-Chapelle, 4 blvd du Palais (Cit\u00e9  4 ). Soaring stained glass windows beaming ample light onto the rich primary colours of the tile mosaics on the floor, this photogenic church was built by the French kings to house the relics of the Crown of Thorns. Make sure you go on a sunny day, as the highlight of this small chapel in Rayonnante Gothic style are the large stained-glass windows which soar up to near the vaulted ceiling. Also of interest is the extremely ornate lower level. If it happens to be rainy or cloudy, give Sainte-Chapelle a miss, as the play of coloured lights on the floor is well worth the wait for a sunnier day. As the chapel is inside the Courts of Justice, there will thus be a security check.   \n11 \u00c9glise Saint-Eustache (Les Halles  4 ). The massive parish church of the Les Halles area is a notable example of late Gothic interspersed with Renaissance details (including the entire front fa\u00e7ade), as it was only completed in the 17th century. Its unique form results from a combination of relatively short length and impressive height of over 30 m inside. The latter allows room not only for an array of stained glass windows and paintings, but also France's largest church organ of 8,000 pipes. The sculpture \u00c9coute, depicting an oversized human head, was placed in front of the church's southern facade and has become a favourite photo spot.   \n\n12 Bourse de commerce. The former commodities exchange building is now not needed for its original purpose as the exchange got digitized, and is mainly used for special events, often unrelated to its original function.   (updated Jul 2016)\n13 Le Palais Royal (Palais Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre  1  7 ). Ordered by Cardinal de Richelieu (1585-1642); originally called Palais Cardinal; it became Le Palais Royal when Anne d'Autriche, Louis XIII's wife, came to live here. It eventually housed Louis XIV until the move to Versailles. It includes also a garden Les jardins du Palais Royal. It's been the theatre of one of the seminal events of the French Revolution (Camille Desmoulins made a famous declaration here in 1789). The Th\u00e9atre Fran\u00e7ais nearby was built in 1716. There are numerous restaurants inside the garden , There's also the controversial Colonnes de Buren, striped columns installed within the inside yard amid the 17th century architecture.   \n\n14 Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, 2 place du Louvre (Louvre-Rivoli  1 , Pont-Neuf  7 ), stgermainauxerrois@free.fr. This Gothic church functioned until the 19th century as the parish church of the kings of France. Its bell called 'Marie' sounded on the night of 23 August 1572, to launch the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed by Catholic mobs.   (updated Jul 2016)\n\n15 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Place du Carrousel (M\u00e9tro: Louvre). Its exhibits come from such diverse origins as ancient Egypt, classical Greece and Rome, medieval Europe, and Napoleonic France. Its most famous exhibit, of course, is Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa (French: La Joconde, Italian: La Gioconda), generally to be found surrounded by hordes of camera-flashing tourists. If you want to see everything in the Louvre, plan at least two full days. However, it is better to pick and choose, as the collection was assembled with an eye to completeness rather than quality.   \n1 Com\u00e9die Francaise (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, La maison de Moli\u00e8re), 1 Place Colette (Palais Royal - Mus\u00e9e du Louvre). The theatre is one of the rare state theatres in France. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. It was enlarged and modified in the 1800s, then rebuilt in 1900 after a severe fire. The played repertoires sum to around 3,000 works.   \n1 Restaurants du monde, 99, rue de Rivoli, mezzanine level, Le Carrousel du Louvre (M\u00e9tro: Palais Royal). A food court where some 13 stalls offer a variety of French and international cuisine including Lebanese, Mexican, Moroccan, Chinese, and Japanese. \n2 Caf\u00e9 Marly, 93, rue de Rivoli / cour Napol\u00e9on du Louvre (M\u00e9tro: Palais Royal), contact@beaumarly.com. Part of the Grand Louvre redevelopment. Caf\u00e9 Marly was opened in 1994 and is on the balcony on the northern terrace of the Cour Napol\u00e9on. Patrons can enjoy direct views of the Louvre Pyramid while sitting back in comfortable chairs, watching tourists stroll by. \n\n16 Mus\u00e9e des Arts d\u00e9coratifs, 107, rue de Rivoli (Palais Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre  1  7 ). A monument to the French art de vivre, housed in a 19th-century wing of the Louvre that has been restored to beaux-arts splendour, its galleries and period rooms showcase eight centuries of Gallic taste in interior decoration.   \n17 Colonne Vend\u00f4me (Op\u00e9ra  3  7  8 ). The centrepiece of a magnificent 8-sided square first laid out in 1699 to show off an equestrian statue of Louis XIV, removed amid revolutionary fervor in 1792 and replaced in 1806 with the Colonne de la Grande Arm\u00e9e. The present column is a replica, however, as the original was pulled down during the 1871 Paris Commune. Place Vend\u00f4me represents the best of well-heeled Paris, being home to an abundance of exclusive boutiques, several banks, the French Ministry of Justice, and the Ritz Hotel.   \n18 Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries  1 ). Originally adjoining the lost palace of the Tuileries, these gardens west of the Louvre offer a central open space for Parisians and visitors with semi-formal gardens (an outdoor gallery for modern sculpture), various caf\u00e9s, ice cream and cr\u00e9pe stalls, and a summer fun fair. The gardens are frequently home to a giant Ferris wheel and enclose the Mus\u00e9e de la Orangerie and the Jeu de Paume.   \n19 Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, 1, rue de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur / rue de Lille (In the 5th arrondissement; on the Left Bank of the Seine, adjacent to the Pont Solferino and Pont Royal, opposite the Jardin des Tuileries, M\u00e9tro: Solferino, or Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, RER C: Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, bus 24, 63, 68, 69, 73, 83, 84, 94). Housed in a former Beaux-Arts railway station (completed in 1900 for the Exposition Universelle, later saved from demolition and converted to its present use), the rambling, open-plan museum is home to the works of the great artists of the 19th century (1848-1914) - Impressionists, post-Impressionists, and the rest - that were formerly displayed in the l'Orangerie. This is perhaps the most spectacular collection of European impressionism in the world\u2014breath-taking rooms full of Manet, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, and many others. Impressionist represent the biggest draw, but there is much more to explore.   \n\n20 L'Orangerie (Mus\u00e9e de la Orangerie). This small museum near the Louvre houses the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume Collection, sold to the French Republic on very generous terms and numbering 143 paintings from the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century (15 C\u00e9zannes, 24 Renoirs, 10 Matisses, 12 Picassos, 28 Derains, 22 Soutines). The collection joined the eight immense Water Lilies that Monet gave France in 1922 and which have been displayed since 1927 in two huge oval rooms purpose-built on the artist's instructions.   \n21 Jeu de Paume (Concorde  1  8  12 ; NW corner of the Jardin des Tuileries). Built during the First Empire, in imitation of the Orangerie, this small building is used by the Galerie Nationale to mount shows dedicated to lesser known, but nonetheless interesting, artists or (sometimes) the lesser known works of the Great Masters. This museum once housed many of the Impressionist painters that are now to be found in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on the other side of the River Seine.   \n1 Le Carrousel du Louvre, 99 Rue de Rivoli. A diverse underground shopping precinct adjoining the Louvre Museum. Open daily including Sundays. There is also a direct access into the Louvre. \n2 Librairie Galignani, 224, rue Rivoli (M\u00e9tro: Concorde). British and American bookshop, specialising in fine arts. \n3 W.H. Smith, 248, rue de Rivoli (M\u00e9tro: Concorde). The largest English language bookshop in Paris carries many of the newest releases. (updated Jul 2016)\n\n\n8th arrondissement\nSee also: Paris/8th arrondissement\nThe legendary Avenue des Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es stretches from the Place de la Concorde to the Place Charles de Gaulle, through the 8th arrondissement. The road is dominated by flagship fashion stores and fine diners.\n\nAt the east end of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es is 22 Place de la Concorde, the largest square in Paris with fantastic vistas in every direction. It was in this square (then called la Place de la Revolution) that the French King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and many others were guillotined during the Terror. The large Egyptian obelisk in the centre of the Place de la Concorde was brought from the Temple of Luxor.\n23 \u00c9glise de la Madeleine (La Madeleine), place de la Madeleine (M\u00e9tro: Madeleine). One of the best-known and most beautiful churches in Paris, in the guise of a Corinthian order classical temple. Construction started in 1764, although the church was not finally consecrated until 1845. The Madeleine has a lavish interior of marble and gold.   \n24 Le Grand Palais (Galeries nationales du Grand Palais). Built in 1900 for the universal exposition, the Grand Palais was an engineering feat and a milestone of design, marking the transition between historicism and modern architecture. It remain impressive today due to its unique, exquisite style and sheer volume of its main nave. The Grand Palais, managed by the state-owned institution Rnm who also manage the Musee de Luxembourg, is used both for temporary exhibitions of historic and contemporary art collections (both beaux arts and applied) and unique events, such as catwalk shows during the Paris Fashion Week, Bonhams car auctions and prestigious galas. Prices and opening hours set individually for each exhibition and event..   \n25 Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais, Avenue Winston Churchill (Metro Champs-Elys\u00e9es Cl\u00e9menceau (M1, M13)).

The unmistakable facade is inspired by Citroen's chevron logo, and the building has no less than seven storeys exhibiting Citroen's past, present and future, including iconic classics, the concept cars and winning sportscars from its many decades of history, and of course the current lineup. The interior is just as spectacular and unique as the exterior and well worth a visit.  \n5 Atelier Renault, Avenue des Champs-Elysees 51-53. Renault has opened its Champs-Elysees showroom at this location in 1910. The highlight of its current form, launched in 2011, is the cafe/restaurant/bar in the \"floating\" mezzanine, where you can enjoy some good drinks and food as well as a nice view over the Champs Elysees and the Renault cars from the past and present exhibited below.  \n Guerlain, No. 68. \n6 Avenue Peugeot, Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es 136. While not as spectacular from the outside as its sister brand Citroen's building, the Avenue Peugeot is also worth a visit if you are a car fan, as it always has a temporary exhibition of some of Peugeot's concept or competition cars the brand is famous for. You can obviously also explore the regular range of Peugeot cars and purchase one, as well as an extensive range of Peugeot merchandise from the on-site \"boutique Peugeot\", including the Peugeot condiment grinders the company makes for much longer than it does build cars. \n7 Louis Vuitton Building, Avenue de Champs-Elysees 101.

Famous in electronic lounge music circles for having commissioned a series of lounge and down tempo records which you can get at most larger record shops in France, as well as abroad. Although you can also get them at the bar it's probably not the best way, since they charge \u20ac45 per CD. The drinks are not so over-priced, and definitely worth it for the hip, sophisticated, and chill atmosphere. \n\n28 l'Arc de Triomphe, Place de l'\u00c9toile, Place Charles de Gaulle (M\u00e9tro Charles de Gaulle-Etoile). This iconic triumphal arch forms the focus of the main east-west road axis of Paris, running between the Louvre and the Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense in the west. The monument was commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 as a tribute to his victories as Emperor of France - it was finally completed in 1836, long after his death. 50 m (150 ft) high and 45 m wide, the Arc de Triomphe is decorated with battle scenes and martial sculptures that includes La Marseillaise by Rude. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was placed beneath the arch in 1920, where an eternal flame burns in tribute to the French dead of both World Wars. The arch is surrounded by a large roundabout, aptly known as l'Etoile - 'the star' - with 12 thoroughfares leading off from it. Visitors can purchase a ticket to climb to the top of the arch, from where magnificent views spread out over western Paris. Admission to a small museum devoted to the history and meaning of the monument is included. The central island and the arch are accessed by an underground passage. Do not attempt to negotiate by foot the busy multi-lane road that rings the Arc de Triomphe, which many Parisian drivers seem to consider their own personal speedway.   \n\n\n16th and 17 arrondissements\nSee also: Paris/16th arrondissement, Paris/17th arrondissement\nThe Avenue de la Grande Arm\u00e9e and the Avenue Charles De Gaulle make up the border between the 16th and 17th arrondissements.
