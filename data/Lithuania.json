  "extract": "Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuva) is a Baltic country in northeastern Europe. Lithuania possesses a unique character that distinguishes it from other Baltic countries. Its distinctiveness arises from being primarily a Catholic nation and having a history of being part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was one of the most powerful entities in Northern Europe.\nLithuania is a charming country with a rich history and culture that is definitely worth exploring. From the charming streets of Vilnius, the capital city, to the serene beauty of the Curonian Spit, there are plenty of reasons to add Lithuania to your travel bucket list.\n\n\nRegions\nRegional differences of Lithuanian culture reflect the complicated historical development of the country. Since the 13th century five ethnographic areas, or regions, have formed the current territory of Lithuania:\n\nThese ethnographic regions even today differ by dialects, ways of life and behaviour styles, while until the turn of the last century there were pronounced differences in dress and homestead styles as well as village planning.\nLithuania is justly proud of its unfailing treasures of folklore: colourful clothing, meandering songs, an abundance of tales and stories, sonorous dialects and voluble language. This ethnographic heritage is nourished by ethnographic and folklore companies and barn theatres. Ethnographic crafts and culinary traditions are being revived. Folk craft fairs and live craft days are organised during many events and festivals.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Vilnius \u2014 capital of the country with many medieval churches\n2 Jonava\n3 Kaunas \u2014 second biggest city and temporary capital between the two world wars\n4 Klaip\u0117da \u2014 third biggest city, famous for its summer festivals\n5 Panev\u0117\u017eys\n6 \u0160iauliai \u2014 fourth biggest city, with a sun theme and specialist museums\n7 Trakai \u2014 on the shores of several lakes\n8 Visaginas  \u2014 Lithuania's newest town, built by the Soviets in 1975 to house the workers of the now-decommissioned Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, and the only town in Lithuania with an ethnic Russian majority\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Auk\u0161taitija National Park \u2014 a land of lakes, hills and forests, popular for water tourism and rural tourism in the summer\n2 Curonian Spit \u2014 unique sand dunes with rare flora, seaboard forest, white sanded beaches and old ethnographic villages\n3 Dz\u016bkija National Park  \u2014 the biggest forest (Dainavos) and swamp (\u010cepkeli\u0173) in the country, and some old unique villages in the middle of the forests\n4 Hill of Crosses  \u2014 site of religious significance, north of \u0160iauliai\n5 Kernav\u0117  \u2014 former Lithuanian capital at the bank of the river Neris and now a well-preserved archaeological site\n6 Purnuskes \u2014 according to some measures the centre of Europe\n7 \u017demai\u010di\u0173 Kalvarija \u2014 famous pilgrimage site, most visitors come in the beginning of July to visit the large church festival\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSome visitors tend to see the Baltic states as being similar countries with regional differences. They share a common recent history: the three countries declared independence in 1918 at the collapse of the Russian Empire, were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, conquered by Nazi Germany in 1941, and incorporated into the Soviet Union from 1944 until independence was restored in 1991. However, there are differences between the countries' languages (Estonians speak a Finnic language unlike Latvia or Lithuania) and religion (Lithuanians are Catholics, Latvians are mostly Lutherans and Estonians are irreligious). Also, Lithuania is more oriented towards Central Europe, while Estonia is oriented towards Northern Europe).\nSince 2004, Lithuania has been a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Lithuania is the only Baltic country with more than 800 years of statehood tradition, while its name was first mentioned one thousand years ago, in 1009. For a period in the 15th century, Lithuania was one of the largest states in all Europe, where crafts and overseas trade prospered.\nIn 1579, Vilnius University, an important scientific and educational centre on the European scale, was opened. In the 16th century, Lithuania adopted its First, Second and Third Statutes. They were the backbone of the legislative system of the country, and had a major impact on the legislation of other European states of the time. Despite merging with Poland and losing its independence, Lithuania managed to keep its Third Statute in effect for as many as 250 years, which was instrumental in preservation of national and civic self-awareness of the public. The Constitution of Lithuania-Poland together with the French Constitution, both adopted in 1791, were the first written constitutions in Europe. Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire in the nineteenth century, became independent after World War I, and was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940, before again gaining its independence in 1991.\n\n\nClimate\nTransitional, between maritime and continental; wet, moderate winters (average of -5 \u00b0C) and summers (average of +16 \u00b0C). Climate is maritime near the seaside with wet, mild summers and winters. Climate in South-Eastern Lithuania is influenced by the continental weather masses with dry, warmer summers and harsher winters.\nSummer months receive the most precipitation (up to 50% of the annual precipitation), autumn and winter are drier with spring being the driest season. Snow occurs every year, it can snow from October to April. In some years sleet can fall in September or May.\n\n\nTerrain\nLowland, many scattered small lakes, fertile soil.  The fertile central plains are separated by hilly uplands that are ancient glacial deposits.\nThe highest point, Aukstojas Hill, is just 294.84 m (967.322 ft), about 24 km southeast of Vilnius, just off the main highway to Minsk and within sight of the Belarus border. 30% of Lithuania is forest covered.\n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth\n\nLithuania was formed in the middle of the 13th century. It became a huge feudal country stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea in the Middle Ages, and in 1569 entered a union with Poland to form a commonwealth. Lithuania was part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth until the Polish Partitions in the 18th century when it became part of the Russian Empire.\nModern Lithuania gained its independence from Russia in 1918 following World War I and the dissolution of the Czarist monarchy. However, in 1940 Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, and shortly thereafter occupied by the Nazis, who murdered almost its entire hitherto very prominent Jewish population and many local Poles, with help from local collaborators. Later in World War II, the Soviet Union recaptured Lithuania and also brutally persecuted and killed many Lithuanians, particularly during Stalin's reign of terror. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but this proclamation was not generally recognised until September 1991, following an abortive coup in Moscow. The Soviet Union recognised Lithuania's independence on 6 September 1991. A constitution was adopted on 25 October 1992. The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions and became a stable democracy and a member of the European Union and NATO.\nLithuania received comparatively fewer Russian immigrants than the other two Baltic states during the Soviet era, and the town of Visaginas is the only one with an ethnic Russian majority. However, significant ethnic Russian minorities exist in Lithuania's major cities. Lithuania was the only one of the three Baltic states to grant citizenship to its ethnic Russian minority following its independence from the Soviet Union.\n\n\nNational holidays\nIndependence Day \u2013 16 February : Independence from Russian Empire in 1918 following World War I.\nRestitution of Independence \u2013 11 March : Restoration of independence from the Soviet Union.\nSt. John's Day \u2013 24 June: Despite its Christian name, celebrated mostly according to pagan traditions (Midsummer's Day).\nStatehood Day \u2013 6 July : Commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. Later rulers of Lithuania were called Grand Dukes.\nChristmas \u2013 25 December\n\n\nVisitor information\nLithuania Travel\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Lithuanian phrasebook\nThe official language of Lithuania is Lithuanian, making up one of two languages (along with Latvian) of the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family. Its highly complex grammar makes it a very difficult language to master. That being said, attempting to learn the language will most certainly endear you to the locals. \nEnglish is widely spoken by the younger generation who grew up after independence, but the older generation who grew up under Soviet rule typically do not speak any English. Lithuanians who speak English are usually keen to practise it with foreigners. \nRussian is commonly used as a second language in Lithuania, although its use is decreasing as most younger Lithuanians prefer to study English. Notwithstanding this tendency, Lithuania is home to a sizable ethnic Russian minority who speak Russian as their first language. According to EU data, 40% of Lithuanians speak Russian. In general, older generations are more fluent in Russian than younger generations, but the younger generation that was educated after independence is more likely to speak English than Russian. Younger ethnic Russians educated after independence are more likely to speak Lithuanian as a second language. Older ethnic Russians who were educated during the Soviet era, on the other hand, usually do not speak any Lithuanian.\nBecause of Lithuania's complicated and turbulent history with Russia, some ethnic Lithuanians may take offence if they are addressed in Russian. The usage of Russian may be interpreted as a lack of respect for Lithuanian language and culture, especially in delicate political circumstances or situations.\nOther spoken languages include Polish and German, but their use is limited to a few pockets in the country.\nIn Samogitia (Western Lithuania), most people also speak Samogitian, which is somewhat different from Standard Lithuanian.\n\n\nGet in\n\nLithuania is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\n\n\nBy plane\nMost airlines arrive at Vilnius International Airport (VNO IATA), the main airport. Low cost carriers serve Kaunas International Airport (KUN IATA). And there is the smaller seaside Palanga airport (PLQ IATA).\nRiga (RIX IATA) airport in Latvia is an attractive alternative for destinations in northern Lithuania. Other alternatives not far from the border are Minsk (MSQ IATA) and Kaliningrad (KGD IATA).\n\n\nBy train\n\nFrom Poland: a daily train runs from Krakow at 04:00 via Warsaw Centralna at 07:30 to reach the border towards 15:00. Here you change onto the Lithuanian train for Kaunas at 16:30 and Vilnius at 17:30. (If you flew into Warsaw, you could take any train to Bia\u0142ystok then join the cross-border train at a more congenial 10:30 next morning.) The westbound train sets off from Vilnius at noon. \nAnother train lumbers on Saturday and Sunday between Bia\u0142ystok and Kaunas on the old route via Mariampole, which pre-dates the Rail Baltica line. So it's overtaken by the Krakow-Vilnius train and you'd only use it to reach one of the villages along the old route.\nFrom Belarus: the trains from Minsk are suspended in 2022.\nFrom Russia: the trains from the exclave of Kaliningrad are suspended in 2022, as are the services via Minsk from Moscow and other Russian cities.\nFrom Latvia: since 27 December 2023 there is now one direct train each way running between Riga and Vilnius, departing Riga at 15:28 and arriving in Vilnius at 19:51. See LTG Link's page for more information.\n\n\nBy car\nMajor \"Via Baltica\" road links Kaunas to Warsaw in the south and Riga and Tallinn in the north. The Baltic road, which links Vilnius to Tallinn, was just reconstructed. It is a very easy and pleasant route.\nOverall, the major roads between the cities are of decent quality. Be extremely cautious when getting off the main roads in rural areas, as some of them may contain pot holes and general blemishes which could damage a regular car if you go too fast. While driving between cities there are usually cafes and gas stations with bathrooms and snacks.\n\n\nBy bus\nEurolines\nEcolines\nBusturas\nFlixBus\n\n\nBy boat\nThere are passenger/car ferries to Klaipeda from Sweden, Germany, Denmark operated by DFDS, Lisco, and Scandlines. However they do not run every day and are relatively slow, but most aim to travel overnight.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy train\n\nState-owned railway passenger service LTG Link has services to major cities in Lithuania as well as an international service from Vilnius to Warsaw and Krac\u00f3w with a change in Mockava. Most of the trains also stop at smaller stations along the way. Part of those smaller stations is inaccessible by any other means of public transportation. Fares are low compared to Western Europe: Vilnius-Kaunas around \u20ac9 \u2013 104 km, Vilnius - Klaip\u0117da  around \u20ac23 \u2013 376 km (as of Mar 2023). In major railway stations tickets are bought at the ticket office inside the station building until around 5 minutes before the departure. A ticket is valid only on the exact train for which it was sold. However it is possible to buy tickets in advance. When buying tickets for round trip 5% discount is applied for return ticket. Many smaller stops have no ticket offices and tickets are bought from the travel attendant on board the train. In case you board the train in a station with a working ticket office and want to buy a ticket from the travel attendant you will pay an additional fee of \u20ac2. However this might be the only option if one arrives too late to the station but manages to catch the train. The same rules for discounts apply as for other public transport in addition to occasional promotional discounts. In particular, there is a 50% discount for students with a Lithuanian Student ID or ISIC. There is also a discount for a group of passengers taking the same train the same day starting at 10% for groups from 3 to 20 people. Tickets are validated by train attendants and must be kept until the end of journey due to sporadic checks by the inspectors.\nDepending on the route trains might be faster or slower option than buses or minibuses. Examples of intercity routes where it is faster to go by train is Vilnius-Klaip\u0117da and Vilnius-Kaunas. There are no high-speed railway lines in Lithuania. Where routes overlap trains usually run less frequently than road  transport. However train sometimes is the only option to reach remote destinations far from major roads and towns (especially on routes Vilnius-Marcinkonys and Vilnius-Turmantas). This make trains popular among wilderness visitors and citizens looking for wild berries or mushrooms.\nIn general trains are more spacious than buses making them suitable for those with large bags or oversized items (such as skis, bikes). It is possible to transport bicycles on board of all the trains however special bike-ticket is needed (fee depends on the distance). Most trains have special racks for bicycles located in the first or last car. However these can accommodate only 2-3 bikes and it is not uncommon to simply line the bicycles along the aisle. Such practice is acceptable provided that the bicycles do not restrict movement of people. Most regional trains have a configuration of 3-3 chairs next to 2-2 chairs across the isle. This means that up to 10 people can see each other simultaneously and makes trains popular among larger companies. In some trains 3 seats form one comfortable bench which is long and wide enough to be used as a bed - provided there is enough place for other passengers. Some of the long-distance trains have compartments which can accommodate six seated passengers, usually on Fridays through Sundays.\nHistorical Auk\u0161taitija Narrow Gauge Railway in Anyk\u0161\u010diai offers short trips to the Rubikiai lake. In summer it runs on regular schedule, rest of the time tours must be booked in advance.\n\n\nBy bus\nIn Lithuania it is easy to move by bus and practically all the bigger and most smaller places can be reached by bus. There are two types of intercity buses: express and regional. Express buses stop only at major towns and usually are much faster than regional. Express buses also tend to be much newer and comfortable. Sometimes (but not always) those buses are explicitly labeled as Ekspresas (\"express\"). It is the best option for longer distance travels between cities. In contrast, regional buses stop at every stop along the way. Thus they usually are slow, for example a 40 km trip can last an hour. Regional buses mainly are old cars that have been imported from the Nordic countries. Service quality in those buses might be lower compared to Western standards. Regional buses are best if you need to reach stations circumvented by express buses. However it is not uncommon for express and regional buses to service the same route thus it is better to ask in advance. Some buses are indirect, i.e. they go via towns out of the direct way between two cities. These are usually labeled as \"CityA - CityB per CityC\" (per meaning \"via\").\nBuses operate regularly between the main centres and the regional centres. There is usually a bus company in every town. Some of the biggest and best are TOKS (from Vilnius), Kautra (from Kaunas), Klaip\u0117dos autobus\u0173 parkas (from Klaip\u0117da), Busturas from \u0160iauliai and mini bus company, Transrevis.  For students with Lithuanian Student ID, bus companies grant 50% discount around the year. By law for students with ISIC (International Student Identity Card) issued in European Union countries, bus companies should also grant 50% discount. Remember to keep your ticket till the end of journey in case inspectors decide to check the bus in one of the stations.\nThe bulk of Lithuania's bus routes and turns has been listed in an address autobusubilietai.lt from which you also can reserve the tickets for certain routes. However, pay attention to the fact that the payment system supports only some of the Lithuanian banks, and your credit card at may not work. Another on-line bus ticket service is iticket.lt which has more payment options.\nFor buses and trolley-buses on routes within towns and cities it is recommended to buy the ticket in advance from a kiosk, board the vehicle using the middle door and stamp the ticket using one of the ticket punches. These used to be near the middle door, but with the introduction of electronic ticketing, there is often a single ticket punch behind the driver's seat. Tickets bought from the driver, rather than kiosks, are more expensive and may also generate an off-handed response if the bus is late or crowded and you don't provide the exact change. Students with Lithuanian Student ID or ISIC (International Student Identity Card) issued in European Union countries are eligible to 50% discount for single tickets and 80% discount for monthly tickets. Inspectors periodically check tickets and will issue a fine if you cannot produce a validated ticket or document proving eligibility to discount. The bus is exited by the middle door and it is important to head for the door before the bus has stopped - it can be impossible to leave once people have started boarding.\nIn addition to common buses, there are minibuses which usually operate express routes.\nThere exists a national public transport route planner visiMarsrutai.\n\n\nBy car\n\nAs with the rest of mainland Europe, Lithuanian traffic travels on the right, and all distances are posted in kilometres.\nThe road network in Lithuania is fairly good, especially the motorways. The quality of road surface on minor roads can vary. Many are unpaved and quite shaky. The improvement work hampers traffic in many places. The Via Baltica road goes through Lithuania from Estonia to Poland. Another important road is the A1 from Vilnius to Klaipeda.\n\n\nRules\n\nSpeed limits for M1 category vehicles:\n\n50 km/h inside cities\n90 km/h on rural roads\n70 km/h on roads without an asphalt or cement pavement\n130 km/h (April-October) or 110 km/h (November-March) on highways\n120 km/h (April-October) or 110 km/h (November-March) on motorways\nheadlights should be on at any time of the day\nTurning right at a red traffic light is allowed where indicated by a green arrow (square white sign next to the red light, containing a green arrow indicating the permitted direction), provided that it does not endanger other traffic. The absence of such a sign means that turning right on red is not allowed, and the police will stop any driver seen breaking this rule. These signs began to be phased out in 2020, however they can still be found.\nMany bigger junctions have a separate green light for traffic turning left, but only one red/yellow light. The green light for the other directions shows arrows going straight and to the right, but these are easily overlooked. Thanks to the white reflective frame around most of these traffic lights, they are most easily identified by their outline.\nOn two- or three- lane roads, it is polite to move out of the right-hand lane (if safe to do so) when you intend to travel straight ahead; this keeps the right-hand lane clear for right-turning traffic. When moving back to the right hand lane watch out for fast-moving vehicles approaching from behind.\nIf the right-hand lane is marked with 'A' it is a dedicated bus lane. A lane marked 'A / TAKSI' can also be used by taxis. Electric vehicles may also use this lane if this is indicated. Other road users may only enter the lane in order to turn right into a side road.\nThe older motorways still have some places in which U-turns are allowed to reach an exit on the opposite carriageway. Usually there is a lower speed limit around these places; the A2 (Vilnius\u2013Panev\u0117\u017eys) has variable speed limit signs which activate when a vehicle is in the U-turn section. \nMotorists do not necessarily observe traffic regulations, so especially the pedestrians should exert the same caution as elsewhere in former Soviet countries. Moving domestic animals and roe deer may cause dangerous situations on the roads and motorways.\nRoundabouts are a feature of the Lithuanian road network, particularly in the cities. Visitors from countries where this type of junction is uncommon or not used at all, may find the  Wikipedia article on roundabouts useful.\nThe blood alcohol limit is 0.4\u2030 in Lithuania for drivers of private passenger cars; lower limits apply for other vehicle categories, commercial transport or novice drivers (who have held a drivers license for less than two years).\nFixed speed cameras are frequent along country roads and motorways, usually near crossroads or pedestrian crossings, and in cities. These are usually announced by a sign. Many of them appear to be designed to be turned around from time to time, watching the opposite direction. There is also an increasing number of speed cameras controlling the average speed of the vehicle over the distance.\n\n\nFuel\n\nPetrol and diesel fuel is available at all filling stations. LPG is available at most larger stations. EV is more seldom. Petrol nozzles are green, while diesel nozzles are black.\nWhile there are EU fuel markings at filling stations, there is also the local system. Petrol is labelled with a number, which is usually used on the price sign and is displayed on the pump in larger digits. This number is the RON (Research Octane Number) of the fuel. \"95\" means 95 RON petrol fuel. It is available at all stations. Some stations may also have \"98\". The price of 98 RON petrol is not usually displayed on the sign; you need to look for the price at the pump.\nLPG is labelled as LPG or SND. Stations that provide LPG will also have cabinets with 50-l gas cylinders. These cabinets are usually labelled as DUJ\u0172 BALIONAI (\"gas canisters\"). A canister costs about \u20ac20. These canisters are used mainly for cooking in areas with no natural gas supply, as a cheaper alternative to electric stoves. These canisters are too large to fit into caravans.\nDiesel fuel is usually labelled as \"D\", but it may also be labelled as \"DK\". Some filling stations (especially rural) may also have diesel nozzles labelled as \"DK\". These dispense diesel are meant for agricultural purposes, such as powering tractors and other farm equipment. This fuel is sold in bulk to farmers, which store and dispense it at their farm. It is sold at a discount to farmers, but there are 3 catches:\n\nThere is a quota on how much can be purchased,\nyou cannot use it in your car, and\nyou need to provide a permit to buy this fuel.\nEV chargers can be found at some large filling stations and private establishments.\nUsually, you pay for fuel at the store, which will have a sign that reads PARDUOTUV\u0116. Some stations may also have a self-service machine near the door to the store. You do not usually pay at the pump, except for unattended stations. At most stations, between 22:00 and 06:00, you need to pay before filling up.\n\n\nCar rental\nSome rental companies (especially in the Western EU) may not allow their vehicles to be driven into Lithuania, be sure to check before booking a car. If other modes of transportation do not work for you, you may need to change cars at the border.\nMany of the international car rental companies also operate in Lithuania, but the density of rental stations is not as dense as e.g. in Western Europe. If you are near one of the international airports (Vilnius, Kaunas or Palanga, near Klaip\u0117da), check the web site of that airport for any rental car companies which have a presence there.\nApart from that, there are many smaller car rental companies. Many of them will deliver the car to a previously agreed address (usually only within Lithuania) at a prearranged time. Car return works in the same manner; thus even one-way rental is possible. Surcharges might apply, however, for pick-up and return by rendez-vous. Such rental companies can be found through the two major automobile ad portals:\n\nhttps://autoplius.lt, Skelbimai > Daugiau > Transporto nuoma > Lengv\u0173j\u0173 automobili\u0173 nuoma (Classified ads > More > Vehicle rental > Car rental)\nhttps://autogidas.lt, Nuoma > Automobili\u0173 nuoma (Rent > Car rent)\nCityBee offers smartphone app based car rental.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis are run on a meter and can be booked by the phone numbers shown on the door of the taxi. Taxis are relatively cheap compared to western Europe. Some companies may not be as safe as others, common sense will keep you safe in this regard. \"Taking the long way round\" used to be common but had nearly been eradicated. However, there still were some reports of foreigners paying more than expected. Keep in mind that it is up to the operator to set embarkation and travel fees. Some taxis waiting at the strategic places (for example airports, bus stations) exploit this by setting fees several times higher than market average. In general it is cheaper to order a taxi by phone instead of taking one in the street. You can also ask to quote the price in advance while ordering taxi by phone or before embarking the car. Some visitors leave small tips for the driver however this is entirely optional.\nIf you do not need a fancy ride, taxi can be as cheap as \u20ac0.37/km. Taxi prices in regional cities tend to be considerable lower than in major cities making them more suitable for out of town trips.\nRide-hailing is available in Lithuania and the following are the most anticipated providers:\n\nTAKSI 1820 Works only in Vilnius +37052500500\n1820 (smartphone app)\n Bolt. The most popular ride hailing service which includes many cities. (updated Apr 2023)\n Uber. Works only in Vilnius. (updated Apr 2023)\n Etransport, \u260f +370 611 11111. Works in most cities in Lithuania, similar prices to ride hailing. (updated Apr 2023)\nForus (smartphone app)\n\n\nBy bicycle\nCycling in Lithuania is quite popular, however it depends on the exact location as in major cities pavements usually will have a bicycle pathways with numerous signs, although getting around by bicycle in rural areas might become a bit of a challenge. Two international EuroVelo cycle routes across the country, EuroVelo No. 10 and EuroVelo No. 11 equipped with quality signs, bike paths are of excellent quality.\nIt might be dangerous to leave your bicycle outside alone for more than a few hours without locking it.\nThe international bicycle project BaltiCCycle  may provide you with an information and help.\n\n\nBy thumb\nHitchhiking in Lithuania is generally good, however there have been some incidents in the early 2020s. Use common sense. Get to the outskirts of the city, but before cars speed up to the highway speeds.\n\n\nSee\n\nThe most southern of the Baltic countries, Lithuania's historic heritage sets it quite apart from the other two. Visiting this small but colourful country today, few travelers might guess that this was once the largest nation in Europe. A few monuments are reminders of those golden ages, when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched out far into modern day Russia, Poland and Moldova, but even fewer are still inside the Lithuanian borders. The archaeological site of Kernav\u0117, then a medieval capital, is now a World Heritage Site and has historic hillfort mounds as well as a museum. The Trakai Island Castle in Trakai is sometimes called \"Little Mari\u00ebnburg\". It's located on an island and was one of the main strongholds in the prime days of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although it was severely damaged in 17th century wars with Muscovy, the castle was beautifully restored in the 19th century and is now a popular tourist sight. Kaunas Castle in Kaunas is even older, but only a third of the original building remains.\nThe country's lovely capital, Vilnius, is a small, pleasant place with a UNESCO listed historic centre. It's the perfect place to admire a range of architectural styles, as it boasts a mixture of gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical buildings. Stroll through the narrow streets and cosy courtyards and kick back for a coffee in one of the many caf\u00e9s on Pilies Street. Then, walk down Gediminas Avenue, the town's main street lined with governmental buildings and theatres, towards the old neighbourhood of \u017dv\u0117rynas. With some 65 churches, the famous Gediminas Tower, the Cathedral Square, the Royal Palace, the Presidential Palace and many other monuments and museums, you won't run out of things to see in Vilnius any time soon.\nFor a day at the sea, the popular seaside resort of Palanga is the place to be. Although it gets crowded in summer, it has some great beaches and beautiful sand dunes. Sand dunes is also what you'll find at the almost 100 km long Curonian Split, which separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast. It's a World Heritage Site shared between Lithuania and Russia and is best explored from the large port city Klaip\u0117da, which is also a good hub for other seaside resorts on the Baltic coast. Not far from Klaipeda is the village of Juodkrante, which is famous for its Hill of Witches, decorated with sculptures from the country's legends and tales. The fishermen's town of Nida is praised for its shores and ancient ethnographic cemetery.\nA few kilometres from the northern city \u0160iauliai you'll find the remarkable Hill of Crosses, an extraordinary and popular pilgrimage site. Over 100,000 crosses \u2013 small, huge, simple and exuberant \u2013 have been placed here by faithful from far and wide. On the other side of the country, in the very south, you'll find the popular and classy spa resort town of Druskininkai, surrounded by lakes and rivers.\nLike its Baltic neighbours, Lithuania has a lot to offer for nature lovers. Dense forests, hills, beautiful blue lakes and rivers are the main base. The forested Auk\u0161taitija National Park is perhaps the most popular of the country's national parks, and is home to elk, deer and wild boar. Some of the pines you'll see here are up to 200 years old and the park is a safe haven for many plants and birds that are endangered in the rest of the country. The 126 lakes and countless streams in between them make the park a great place for water sports activities and the villages in the park have some interesting wooden churches. Another favourite is the Nemunas Delta. The vast wetlands around the place where Neman River reaches the Baltic Sea are a popular eco-tourism destination and an important bird habitat.\nLithuania has many religious sites, especially of the Catholic faith. All of them are open for people of any religion and background. The most popular pilgrimage sites to visit are:\n\n\u017demai\u010di\u0173 Kalvarija in Samogitia (most pilgrims come in July)\nHill of Crosses near \u0160iauliai\nOur Lady of the Gate of Dawn, Vilnius\n\u0160iluva, Samogitia.\n\n\nDo\nIf you are searching for some health treatment or recreation the best resorts for that are Druskininkai and Palanga. Neringa is a great option for a nice, calm holiday for becoming one with yourself.\nBasketball is the national sport, and the nation is basketball mad, (comparable to the British with Soccer and New Zealand with rugby).  Lithuania is one of the most successful teams in international competition, winning medals in three out of four Olympic tournaments, (bronze), and finishing fourth in 2008. All this from just five Olympic appearances. Major domestic clubs are BC \u017dalgiris from Kaunas and BC Rytas from Vilnius. For this reason in almost every park and playground you will find a basketball court.\nBe careful if some people challenge you to a basketball game. Common Lithuanians are very good in basketball, and you might just embarrass yourself.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nLithuania uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\n\nLithuania adopted the euro as its currency on 31 December 2015, replacing the litas (plural litai or lit\u0173).  The old currency was converted to euros at a fixed exchange rate of 1:3.45280 Lt. You can exchange the old currency at the central bank indefinitely.\n\n\nTipping\n5% is the standard tipping amount, but in some cases the 5% tip is already included in service charge.\n\n\nShopping\nLithuania has a lot of shopping malls for such a small population. There is no big difference between shopping malls here and in western Europe. Especially, Lithuania has become a shopping tourism destination for citizens of Belarus and Russia where some items are not available or cost considerably more.\nVilnius has become a shopper's paradise when plenty of massive shopping centres were opened all over the city. Akropolis (a chain of shopping malls in Lithuania) is one of them and definitely worth visiting if you are a shopping malls maniac, as it houses an ice skating rink, bowling lanes and a cinema. The largest shopping centers are Akropolis and Panorama.\nGariunai is the Baltic's largest open air market, located on the western edge of Vilnius. Thousands of merchants can be found there on a good weekend, from not only Lithuania, but also from as far away as Ukraine. Clothes, shoes, music and software can be bought there. Counterfeit goods are ubiquitous. A low price is guaranteed, quality is not.\nKaunas is also a city of shopping centers, and Laisv\u0117s avenue in the center of the city is a pedestrian thoroughfare. The main shopping centers in Kaunas are: Akropolis, Mega, Molas, Savas, HyperMaxima, and Urmas shopping area. There is even that symbol of \"mall culture\", which is new to Lithuania, Akropolis.\nKlaipeda is a major shopping center for people from Latvia and Kaliningrad. The main shopping centers are: Akropolis, Arena, Studlendas and BIG. Many people coming to the city on cruise ships shop in Klaipeda, due to the good value and price combination.\n\n\nEat\n\nLithuanian dinners usually include meat, potato, vegetables and sometimes a curd sauce of some sort. Case in point: the cepelinai, or zeppelins, which are meat filled potato-starch based zeppelin-shaped masses traditionally slathered in a sauce of sour cream, butter, and pork cracklings. Pork is traditionally eaten, beef much less so. Vegans will have a hard time eating out, although some large restaurant chains will have vegetarian dishes on the menu.\nSome fast food in Lithuania, such as Kibinai (from the Karaim people) small turnovers usually filled with spiced lamb, and \u010ceburekai (a Crimean Tatar snack), large folds of dough with a scant filling of meat, cheese, or even apples, can be found around the city.\nMany restaurants have menus in English (usually in the Lithuanian menu) and to a lesser extent, Russian. Though use caution as sometimes menus in other languages may have inflated prices, although this is a rarity, and won't be found in Vilnius, or the better known chains such as \u010cili Pica.\nWhile in Lithuania, one should try these national dishes: appetisers - Pir\u0161teliai prie alaus - thin, rolled-up puff pastries served with beer; main courses: Cepelinai (or did\u017ekukuliai) su spirgu\u010diais - potato balls with meat (about \u20ac3.20); V\u0117darai - a sausage, made of a potato stuffed intestine of a pig (about \u20ac3); Skilandis - pig stomach stuffed with meat, garlic and cold-smoked; Plok\u0161tainis - meal of potatoes (\u20ac2.30\u20134); Bulviniai blynai (grated potato pancakes) with different sauces; Virtinukai - curd patties; Kastinys - soft sour cream butter; \u0160altnosiukai - dumplings filled with lingonberries; Fish - pike or perch, is often baked whole or stuffed, or made into gefilte fish (various prices); Silk\u0117 - marinated, baked, fried or served in aspic herring; soups - \u0160altibar\u0161\u010diai (a summer soup based on beets and soured milk), Juka (blood soup) or Cabbage soup flavored with carrots, ham, onions. Rugin\u0117 duona (dark rye bread) is very advisable to try with soups. Lithuanian cuisine is also famous for wide use of wild berries, mushrooms, and cheese. Honey and poppy seeds are commonly used as filling in pastries. For desserts, try \u017dagar\u0117liai - twisted, thin deep-fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar or Spurgos - a Lithuanian variant of doughnuts, often filled with preserves.\n\n\nDrink\n\nLithuania is a beer-drinking country, with the most famous brands being Svyturys, Kalnapilis, Utenos, Volfas Engelman and Gubernija. A visit to a kiosk will show that there may be more than 50 different brands of beer in this small country.  Alcohol percentages are displayed on the label, and usually range from 4\u20139.5%. Compared to other European countries, beer is usually affordable, in shops \u20ac0.50\u20131 per half litre, in bars \u20ac0.75\u20132 per half litre. The beer tastes excellent, putting global brands to shame and it can be said that Lithuanian lager is of at least equal quality to Czech, Slovak, German and Polish lager. A request for a Lithuanian beer always generates goodwill, even in a Chinese or other foreign-themed restaurant.\nWhen you visit a bar or restaurant without intending to eat, try one of the bar snacks, which are very popular among Lithuanians. The most popular of these snacks consists of a bowl of pieces of garlic bread covered in cheese.\nIn addition to beer, rather cheap but high quality vodka (or \"degtin\u0117\" in Lithuanian) is consumed, but not to the extent usually associated with this part of the world. Also, every region has its own home-made speciality of which \"Samane\" is most famous or notorious and is best avoided. The larger supermarkets have an incredible variety of vodka from all the main vodka-producing countries.\nLithuanian mead, or \"midus\" is a beverage produced exclusively under government control. It is commonly made from various types of Lithuanian flora, from leaves and berries to some tree bark. Alcohol content range from 10\u201375% (considered medicinal).\nFor tourists, quality sparkling wines, such as Alita or Mindaugas, and local liqueurs are popular choices to bring back home.\nAlcohol cannot be sold in shops between 20:00 (15:00 on Sundays) and 10:00, but can be purchased in bars, cafes and restaurants.\nIn shops and caf\u00e9s different tea and coffee qualities are widely available. The selection in coffee ranges from northern European brands to French ones. In coffee houses, you should expect to pay up to \u20ac1.50 for your coffee. Some caf\u00e9s offer also a variety of special coffees with more or less special prices. Many cafes (kavin\u0117s) still make \"lazy\" coffee, which is simply coffee grounds and boiling water, unfiltered, with grounds at the bottom of the cup, often surprising the drinker - ask before you buy. Tea is usually sold at 50% of the price of coffee. Some of the wonderful drinks such as the Marganito are great for fun filled party drinks and rated one of the top kinds of wine in the country, perfect for weddings.\nUnlike restaurants, or pubs aimed at tourists, bars (Baras) may be frequented by heavy drinkers and can therefore be somewhat rowdy. Nevertheless, a visit may still be very rewarding, especially if you accept an invitation to participate in karaoke.\nSmoking is banned in caf\u00e9s, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, discoth\u00e8ques and other public establishments. However, many nightclubs have internal smoking rooms, which have a degree of ventilation.\n\n\nSleep\n\nThe price of accommodation depends very much on the place. For instance, in Joni\u0161kis (Northern Lithuania), you can get a good hotel room for \u20ac25 whereas an equivalent room might be as much as \u20ac100 in Vilnius. Some hotels do not have home pages. Nevertheless, the Internet helps considerably in planning.\nThroughout the country, homestays, sleeping \"with the grandmother\", are typical. On main street of a town there are many elderly townsfolk offering spare beds in their extra rooms. These experiences are worth seeking out.\nIf you want to rent the apartment, the prices will be usually from \u20ac200 a month. In the biggest towns there are companies which rent apartments \"to the long-time tourist or working here\". In these you complete on good conditions the apartment furnished and cleaned by the cleaner. From \u20ac300.\nIf you are looking for an apartment for a shorter period (from a few days onwards), do a Web search for \"trumpalaik\u0117 but\u0173 nuoma\". This will give you some portals or sites of companies, though not all of them are available in English \u2013 some are, however, available in other languages such as German, Polish or Russian.\nYou will find the hotels of every town on their own interleaves. However, remember that this is the service maintained by the volunteers and you should not wait for current prices let alone that there would be all the possibilities listed.\nAn interesting accommodation alternative is a countryside accommodation or an own cottage. Countryside.lt offers the shining catalog for accommodation alternatives and you find nearly all the countryside targets and a reservation system from there.\nMost large cities such as Vilnius or Kaunas have an abundance of hotel options. When traveling to a popular vacation spot in the summer (like Palanga or Druskininkai) make sure to book a room in advance because demand may outnumber supply.  Additionally, some of the cafes on the main highways between cities also have rooms to rent.\n\n\nLearn\nLithuania has one of the best educational systems in the world. Many universities participate in student exchange programs. Most popular international university in Lithuania is LCC International University in Klaipeda. The best universities of Lithuania are Vilnius University (Vilniaus Universitetas), Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas) and Kaunas University of Technology (Kauno Technologijos Universitetas).\nIn Kaunas there is the biggest technical university, KTU, in the country and a medical university LSMU (Lithuanian University of Health Sciences), sports academy LKKA, music and theatre academy LMTA, agriculture university ASU and multidisciplinary University of Vytautas Magnus, VDU.\nKlaipeda and Siauliai also has its own universities. In the country several lower educational institutions which go with the name kolegija (eng. college) also are found.\nThe course supply hangs very much from the university and there also are somewhere programmes for English. However, pay attention to the fact that Lithuania's official language is Lithuanian and in the law it has been prescribed that the Lithuanian student has a right to study in Lithuanian in Lithuania. Especially all the courses of the candidate level will be thus in Lithuanian and in the Master of Arts programmes in English the bulk of the courses is in English. Depending on the rules of the university the courses must have a certain number of foreign students attending before the lectures need to be in English (this concerns courses announced to be held in English) and if this limit is not exceeded, the lecturer may lecture, if desired, in Lithuanian.\nThe grading system in Lithuania is generally 1\u201310 in which 5-10 correspond to the accepted performances. The local students usually have to keep their average very high and still a higher one in order to get the scholarship in order to guarantee free studies. There is no financial aid for studies.\n\n\nWork\nThere are now many work options in Lithuania. One seldom manages working life without control of the language, therefore basic working knowledge of Lithuanian is highly recommended. You may get by with Russian or, to an increasing extent, English, although your mileage may vary.\nAny EU national can work and live freely in Lithuania. However, EU nationals spending more than 90 days over an 180-day period in Lithuania need to obtain a residence title (teis\u0117s Lietuvos Respublikoje gyventi pa\u017eym\u0117jimas or just TLRGP). This document is issued to any EU national who can provide proof of a valid health insurance (in the form of a European Health Insurance card) and a source of sufficient income (the amount is determined based upon individual circumstances). It can be applied for at Migracijos departamentas (Department of Migration). Upon obtaining the residence title, registering your residence with the municipality of residence is mandatory within a month. This requires proof, such as a rental contract, the landlord's signature on the declaration form or an extract from the land register proving your ownership. Not all immigration officials are familiar with the procedures for EU nationals (which are much less stringent than those for non-EU nationals), therefore ask if you have doubts.\nNon-EU nationals need a residence permit and a registered address for working.\nThe Migration Department provides its services in Lithuanian, English and Russian. Visits require registration through the web site, which is also where you can indicate what language you would like to communicate in.\nAs of 2021, workers in Lithuania pay 20% income tax (up to \u20ac400/month are exempt from taxes for workers earning less than approx. \u20ac2700/month) and 19.5% for health and unemployment insurance. Web sites such as Atlyginimo skai\u010diuokl\u0117 provide an exact breakdown.\nWorkers are required by law to undergo periodic health inspections if they are under 18, work shifts or during night hours, or if their workplace exposes them to certain risk factors. The latter is the case even for office jobs (risks being eye strain and carpal tunnel syndrome).\n\n\nStay safe\nIn general, Lithuania is a safe country. But you should take basic safety measures:\n\nTake care when visiting potentially dangerous neighbourhoods at night. After dark it is safer to walk along main roads, than to take a short cut through a park or apartment complex, as these areas often have very poor lighting. Take a taxi if you are afraid of possible encounters. A thing to watch out for is bicycle theft, and it is advisable not to leave valuable things in your car.\nAs in other Eastern European countries, public displays of affection between same-gender partners such as holding hands or kissing may result in a confrontation from an onlooker. Suspicion of homosexuality may also cause problems.\nMembers of ethnic minorities, (particularly those of African descent), may experience some form of racism. This is not tolerated by the authorities and racist attacks are rare. However non-whites might be stared at by locals, especially in rural areas. More often than not this can be out of pure curiosity rather than malice. The issue of race relations, the history of slavery and civil rights are relatively unknown. That said, the presence of several Afro-American basketball players in the Lithuanian league does help and means that racism is perhaps not as big a problem as other eastern European countries.\nDriving in Lithuania is considered dangerous according to European standards. Lithuania's rapidly expanding economy has led to an increase in traffic density, thus accident rates are high.  As a pedestrian, take great care when crossing the roads, as pedestrian crossings are widely ignored. When driving be careful of aggressive, quickly going and irresponsible drivers. It's better to pass them even if they are flouting rules. Keep in mind that traffic police could be corrupt. Mind the forest roads, collisions with wildlife animals can easily occur.\n\n\nStay healthy\nIf bitten by a dog, wild animal or a snake, seek medical attention immediately. Snakes are not venomous in Lithuania, except for the European Viper (angis) whose bite only rarely is lethal though quite painful. A dog (\u0161uo) or cat (kat\u0117) bite can carry the risk of rabies. Mosquitoes (uodai) carry no disease and are only an annoyance in the summer months. A forest tick (erk\u0117) bite carries the risk of Lyme disease or encephalitis.\nTap water is suitable for drinking in many parts of Lithuania. In other areas, local people prefer to purchase bottled water or to run tap water through water filters. If you need to buy bottled water, a 5-litre bottle is not much more expensive than a one-litre bottle. Where in doubt about the tap water, seek local advice.\nMineral water is also offered in restaurants, caf\u00e9s and shops, although it's a bit more expensive than tap water. Some popular brands are Birut\u0117 and Vytautas. But be warned - those are carbonated, and foreigners describe \"Vytautas\" as \"sea water\" due to its salty taste.\n\n\nRespect\n\nLithuanians are a Baltic nation and are their own people; confusing them as Russians or anything else may cause offense or result in puzzled reactions.\nLithuanian is a notoriously difficult language to master and Lithuanians do not expect you to know it perfectly. Still, learning a few words of Lithuanian can go a long way.\nAlthough most Lithuanians are members of the Catholic Church, Lithuanians are not ardently religious; church attendance is among one of the lowest in the world. \nSocietal attitudes towards Muslims, the LGBTQ+ community, and people with disabilities tend to be negative.\nLithuania was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union from the end of World War II until 1990. However, due to several historical events, including 19th century occupations by Tsarist Russia, territorial disputes with Poland in the early 20th century, and Soviet rule in the 20th century; discussions of disputes with neighboring countries can be sensitive. When referencing Lithuania in the context of the former USSR, it's essential to exercise caution as praising Soviet practices is unlikely to be appreciated by Lithuanians. \nWorld War II and the Holocaust are emotional and sensitive topics for many Lithuanians.\nLithuanians may appear at times nationalist. Ethnic identities and local traditions might be taken very seriously. The history of the country is rife with invasions and confrontations. It is best to avoid superficial comments on sensitive topics such as World War II, Nazi occupation, and Soviet rule.\nLithuanians may appear sad, depressive (suicide rates in Lithuania are among the highest in the world), a little bit rude and suspicious. Smile at a Lithuanian in the street and most likely they will not respond in kindness. Smiling in Lithuania is traditionally reserved for friends; smile at a stranger and they will either think you're making fun of them and there's something wrong with their clothes or hairdo. Furthermore, an automatic Western smile is often regarded as insincere.\nLithuanians view friendships and relationships as long-term commitments; therefore, the journey to friendship is often a long process. Do not expect Lithuanians to open up to you that easily and do not be taken back if they do not show interest in you right away. \nWomen in the entire former USSR area are traditionally treated with respect. Female travellers should not act indignant when local male friends pay their bills at restaurants, open every door in front of them, offer their hand to help them climb down that little step or help them carry anything heavier than a handbag - this is not sexual harassment or being condescending.\nAs is the case throughout the Baltic countries, there is still widespread resentment and distrust towards Russia and Lithuanians are often stereotyped as \"anti-Russian\". Keep in mind that most Lithuanians have absolutely nothing against Russian people; rather, many of them only remain distrustful of the Russian government.\nAnti-China sentiment is also high in Lithuania, and most Lithuanians are staunch supporters of the Taiwan independence movement. Taiwan's struggle for independence from China is seen by most Lithuanians as reminiscent of their own long and hard struggle for independence from the Soviet Union.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nLand line phones\nThere is a monopoly operator for land line phones: TEO (it now belongs to \"TeliaSonera AB\"), a subsidiary of Sweden (Telia) and Finland (Sonera). Land line phones are easy to find throughout the country. Phones are used with cards, which you can find in kiosks, \"TEO\" or newspaper stands.\n\n\nMobile phones\nThere are three major mobile phone operators in Lithuania: Telia, BITE and TELE 2. About 97% of the country's surface is covered by the standard European GSM 900/1800 MHz network, the remaining 3% are non-walkable forests.\nThe pre-paid SIM cards you can buy in any kiosk and they are: Pildyk (Tele2), Labas (Bite) and E\u017eys (Telia). Pildyk has the cheapest internet, but the smallest coverage area (which should suffice unless you want to use internet in deep forests). For onward travel, only E\u017eys includes EU roaming allowances in its plans, while the others charge extra for this.\nGetting a monthly-rate plan (if you intend to stay longer) can be difficult. As of 2021, Tele2 will not sell monthly-rate plans to foreigners (even EU citizens) unless they have a permanent residence permit. Bit\u0117 is more flexible in that respect.\nIf you are planning to live in Lithuania, get a plan which includes a mobile signature (mobilusis para\u0161as). This provides you with a way to log in to virtually every government services and plenty of non-government ones (such as banking or utilities suppliers) using your phone. Being implemented as a SIM toolkit app, it works with pretty much any phone (not just smartphones) and doesn\u2019t require you to download an app.\n\n\nInternational calls\nTo call abroad from Lithuania:\n\nFrom a land line phone: 00 Your Country Code The Number Abroad\nFrom a mobile phone: + Your Country Code The Number Abroad\nTo call to Lithuania from abroad, dial the Lithuania country code, +370, then the number, as if calling from a domestic mobile phone. It is also often that the number is written with 8 in the beginning (i. e. 86XXXXXXX), in this case simply replace 8 with +370 to make a call.\nInternational and roaming calls are expensive. To reduce your bill you can:\n\nBuy \"phone cards\" for international calls\nTalk over the Internet\n\n\nInternet\nIf you're bringing a laptop, Wireless LAN Hot-Spots are available in distinct places (mostly \"Zebra\" from - TEO), sometimes free, otherwise not very cheap. Best chances of finding one are at airports, railway stations, in caf\u00e9s, shopping malls, universities, various places. You can ask in your hotel, but be prepared to pay. For those who need to connect at an Internet cafes, major cities do have internet cafes. You can get free wireless Internet in Kaunas main pedestrian street, Laisv\u0117s Al\u0117ja. Download speed reaches 26.2 Mbit/s, while upload speed is 16.8 Mbit/s. The internet service that provide such speeds are not free.\nWith your mobile phone you can use: CSD, HSCSD, GPRS or EDGE, but the cost may be unattractive. There's 4G coverage almost everywhere in the country, except for a few spots in the countryside. If your phone is not SIM-locked, you may consider purchasing a pre-paid SIM card designed for data access.\nIf you want to communicate with your friends or locals using internet, you'll need Facebook Messenger. Whatsapp is not very popular here. Older generation people usually have Viber too. The most popular social websites are Facebook and Instagram. Though Facebook is being used by older people, while younger people choose Instagram.\n\n\nPost office\nIf you see the sign \"Lietuvos pa\u0161tas\" on a storefront, this doesn't mean it is a pasta shop! It is actually the post office where you can mail letters and packages.",
