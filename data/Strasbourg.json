  "extract": "Strasbourg (German: Stra\u00dfburg, Alsatian: Strossburi) is the capital of the Grand-Est region of France and is most widely known for hosting a number of important European institutions. It is also famous for its beautiful historical centre - the Grande \u00cele, which was the first city centre to be classified entirely as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nStrasbourg is the ninth largest city in France with nearly half a million inhabitants in a metropolitan area spanning across the river into the German city of Kehl, on the eastern bank of the Rhine.\nThe city is the seat of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights, the European Ombudsman, the Eurocorps, the European Audiovisual Observatory and, most famously, the European Parliament, which also holds sessions in Brussels.\nStrasbourg is a popular tourist destination primarily thanks to the beautifully preserved and pedestrian-friendly city centre, which can be explored on foot or bicycle in a few days. Don't forget that Strasbourg's appeal now brings tourists to the city throughout the year, with large tour groups especially frequent during the summer months and during the annual winter market.\n1 Tourist Office of Strasbourg, Place de la Cath\u00e9drale. 09:00 to 19:00. If you ask whether they have maps they try to sell you one for \u20ac1.50 - be sure to ask if they have free maps, what you then get is basically the same as the paid one. They also sell a variety of self-guided walking tours through the town (Middle Ages, Renaissance, Modern and Contemporary) for \u20ac1 each, and can arrange bike tours through the Faubourgs (the suburbs of Neudorf and Neuhof). (updated Aug 2024)\n\n\nTalk\nWhile you will very likely find people who will engage in a conversation in Alsatian (which may vaguely sound like German to you), the lingua franca of Strasbourg (and all of Alsace) is French. It is possible to hear Alsatian spoken on the streets, especially around the Cathedral. Alsatian (the historic Germanic language of Alsace) is a declining language, spoken mostly by the region's older residents or in rural areas but efforts are underway to revive it. Due to the presence of the EU, chances are you might encounter locals that speak pretty good English. As Germany is right next door and due to heavy tourism from there, nearly everyone in the tourism sector can speak some German.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nStrasbourg has its own airport, however there are (relatively) nearby airports which have a wider range of destinations:\n\n2 Strasbourg International Airport (SXB  IATA) (southwest of the city, at Entzheim). There are domestic nd international flights. Air France is the principal operator. Destinations include Casablanca, Istanbul, Madrid Barajas, Brussels and Amsterdam Schiphol among others. A train runs to the town centre (\u20ac4, including a tram connection, valid for 90 min. If you only need to get to the central station, buy your ticket not from the machines in the arrivals hall but on the train platform directly where the ticket will cost \u20ac2.30). The travel time is 9 minutes and the frequency is 15 minutes.   (updated Mar 2023)\nBasel-Mulhouse-Freiburg Airport BSL IATA: there is a short bus connection to the railway station of Saint-Louis, which is 1 hr 20 min by train, from the main Strasbourg train station.\nKarlsruhe/Baden-Baden Airport FKB IATA is about 60 km (37 mi) away in Germany. The best way to get to Strasbourg is by bus from the airport to Baden-Baden Hauptbahnhof (Main Station); from here trains run to Strasbourg, normally with one change (45 min-1 hr). Flibco operates buses to from the airport and on to Strasbourg.\nStuttgart Airport STR IATA is about 110 km (68 mi) away. Driving by car should take about 2 hr in normal traffic. There are direct buses connecting the city to Stuttgart airport in 2 hr 15 min. Travelling by train, you will most likely have to change once or twice.\nDue to the excellent train connection to Paris, it may make sense to fly into Charles de Gaulle airport and take the TGV from there. Air France and some of its partners offer combined tickets in an air rail alliance.\n\n\nBy train\nStrasbourg is well served by regional, national and international train services, predominantly by SNCF (French Railways), but also by Deutsche Bahn (German Railways).\nStrasbourg is the eastern terminus of a major high speed rail line and thus served by numerous TGV and some ICE trains, most of which continue onwards to Paris or Germany respectively. \nMajor destinations include the following major towns and cities with multiple daily departures. Journey times are approximate, some require TGV trains: Paris 1 hr 50 min, Dijon 2 hr, Lyon 3 hr 40 min, Metz 1 hr 15 min, Nancy 50 min, Marseille 5 hr 30 min, Besancon 1 hr 40 min, Luxembourg 1 hr 40 min, Mulhouse 50 min, Basel 1 hr 25 min, Frankfurt 1 hr 45 min, Stuttgart 1 hr 20 min, Munich 3 hr 40 min, Saarbr\u00fccken 1 hr 30 min by direct local train, Brussels 3 hr 40 min.\nThe TGV Est Europ\u00e9en provides direct services to: Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport 2 hr 25 min, Lille 3 hr 20 min (for same-station connections via Eurostar to London), Rennes 5 hr 15 min, Nantes 5 hr 10 min, Bordeaux 6 hr 45 min.\nComing from Germany with the Deutschland-Ticket you can stay in the RB25 from Offenburg to Strasbourg, but you need to buy an extra ticket for Kehl-Strasbourg for \u20ac4.70, which can be bought online. Or you leave the train in Kehl and take a tram to any point in Strasbourg for \u20ac1.90 . (updated Feb 2024)\nFrom Saarbr\u00fccken, Saar-Elsass ticket can be purchased for \u20ac35 on weekends that enables round-trip for up to 5 travellers. More details are found here.\nThe main train station in Strasbourg is the 3 Gare de Strasbourg, 20 Place de la Gare.   . The station, impressively renovated with a new glass cocoon frontage, is a short walk west of the town center. There are connections to the tram system and buses, with many taxis waiting outside (to the left of the station forecourt). Luggage lockers (open until 9PM) are located on platform 1 and cost \u20ac5.50 for a small (which fits a carry on roller bag) or \u20ac7.50 for a medium (Nov 2024). You need to put your luggage through an x-ray first and be sure to ask the staff for change if you need it. The machines accept exact change only.\nFor details of all services, and to make reservations, contact SNCF. For regional travel, check SNCF TER Alsace  who co-ordinate the efficient and well served regional train network. When planning trips east of Strasbourg into Germany or countries beyond, you could save money by comparing the fares offered by Deutsche Bahn to those of the SNCF.\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: Intercity buses in France\nFlixbus is by far the biggest player in the German market and a big player in the French market as well.\n4 Bus station, Parc de l'\u00c9toile. Drop off point for Flixbus, ALSA and BlablaCar Bus. Getting there: take A, D trams. (updated Feb 2024)\n\n\nBy tram\nThe German town of Kehl just across the border was linked to the Strasbourg tram network in 2017. It is one of only a handful of places worldwide where you can just hop on an urban rail service and let it take you across an international border. Both sides being within the Schengen Area, you don't need to take a passport or answer the question \"business or pleasure\" and you'll likely not be asked by customs agents how much booze you are carrying, either (and the limits are very generous at any rate). There are of course fare inspectors, so don't forget to get a ticket.\n\n\nBy car\nYou can reach Strasbourg by various highways:\n\nfrom the west (Paris, Benelux) taking the A4 highway (E25). About 4 hours from Paris and 2 hr 15 min from Luxembourg.\nfrom the south (Switzerland, Lyon), taking the A35 highway (E25). About 5 hours from Lyon\nfrom the north and east (Germany), taking the A5 highway (E35).\nDriving into Strasbourg's old city is relatively easy although there are a few streets off limits to cars. There are many large garages surrounding the old city if your hotel does not have its own parking facility. Some carparks are more expensive than other, especially for longer stays. The one at Petite France Ste Marguerite is the cheapest at \u20ac7.20/24 hour and \u20ac5.20 for each consecutive day.\nTickets P+R (parking for the day plus return fare on the tram for up to 7 passengers of the car): \u20ac4.10, P+R Rotonde: \u20ac4.60.\n\n\nGet around\n\nStrasbourg is most easily explored on foot, and the historic city centre can easily be explored in a day or two. To be able to cover more ground, you should consider hiring a bike or using the public transport network.\n\n\nBy bike\nStrasbourg is ideal for cycling - the city center is flat and there are plenty of bike lanes and bike paths. You can rent bikes at:\n\nthe automatic or manned bike sharing stations v\u00e9lhop.\nrue du Maire Kuss, in front of the train station\nrue des Bouchers, on the south bank of the Ill river, near the rue d'Austerlitz and the Porte de l'H\u00f4pital tramway station.\nBikes are allowed on trams except during peak hours.\nMore information on cycling in Strasbourg is available on the Strasbourg website.\n\n\nBy bus and tram\n\nBuses and trams in Strasbourg are operated by the Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois (CTS). A few dozen numbered bus lines and six tram lines (named A to F) and two bus rapid transit/BRT ('BHNS') lines (named G and H) serve the city. A single ticketing system covers bus and tram. Tickets are sold in 'tabacs' (newsagents), tourist offices, CTS boutiques or from vending machines at tram stops. Tickets (even ones from the vending machines) should be validated before use, either in the machines on tram station platforms or in the machine by the driver when you board the bus.\nSummary of fares (as of Oct 2018):\n\nAller Simple (one way) \u20ac1.80 (\u20ac2 on board)\nAller Retour (round trip) \u20ac3.50\n10 x Aller Simple (1 contactless ticket suitable only for one person) \u20ac14.10\n24H Individuel (24-hr ticket for one person) \u20ac4.50\nTrio (one day ticket for up to three people) \u20ac6.90\nPrices are slightly lower (e.g. \u20ac1.70 one-way) if loaded onto a Badg\u00e9o card, CTS App or topped up on contactless ticket. CTS App works only with French Sim cards (as of Oct 2018).\nIf you're using the buses and trams a lot, Europass tickets are available from all automatic ticket machines for either 24 hours or seven days. The Europass Mini is valid on all local tram, bus and train services, including those that cross the border to Kehl. The full Europass ticket also covers the local transport of the Ortenau Tarifverbund in Germany including Offenburg  (information in German only).\n\n\nSee\n\n\nGrand \u00cele\n1 Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame. Built between 1176 and 1439 and with a 142-m tower (the highest cathedral tower in France), the Gothic cathedral is undoubtedly Strasbourg's finest architectural highlight.

M W-F 12:00-18:00, Sa Su 10:00-18:00. This museum features articles from the daily lives of Alsatian peoples from the 13th to 19th centuries: clothing, furniture, toys, tools of artisans and farmers, and religious objects used in Christian, Jewish, and even pagan rites. The exhibits are in rooms connected by wooden staircases and balconies in adjacent multistory Renaissance-era houses around a central courtyard. Admission \u20ac6.5.   (updated Sep 2018)\n\n\nPetite France\n\nPetite France is the name given to the small area between the rivers, just south of the Grande \u00cele. It is home to some of Strasbourg's prettiest and most photogenic streets and buildings, with half timbered townhouses leaning out over the narrow cobbled streets. Petite France resembles Colmar (a city an hour south), with picturesque canal and half-timber houses.\n\n6 Barrage Vauban (Vauban Dam), Place du Qur Blanc. The Barrage Vauban is a bridge, weir and defensive work erected in the 17th century. At that time, it was known as the Great Lock (grande \u00e9cluse), although it does not function as a navigation lock in the modern sense of the word. Today it serves to display sculptures and has a viewing terrace on its roof, with views of the earlier Ponts Couverts bridges and Petite France quarter. (updated Aug 2024)\n\n\nEuropean district\nUse bus lines #6, 30, 72 to get there.\n\n7 Council of Europe's seat (Le Palais de l'Europe). built in 1977 by Henry Bernard.

The parliament tends to meet in Brussels more and the arrangement with the parliament moving shop between Brussels and Strasbourg several times a year has been criticized as wasteful of money by EU skeptics and penny-pinchers.

(updated Aug 2024)\n\n\nDo\n\nWalking around the old town is a very nice way to pass a day. And there are lots of good cafes to stop and rest in as you make your tour.\nBoat tours along the Rhine offer views over both Strasbourg and neighbouring Germany. Batorama offer several river tours lasting from around 45 minutes to a few hours, costing around \u20ac10 per person. 45-min tours run around the town center and the European district. Boats can be found below Place du March\u00e9 aux Poissons.\nFootball: RC Strasbourg Alsace play soccer in Ligue 1, the top tier in France. Their home ground Stade de la Meinau (capacity 26,300) is 2 km south of town centre.\nChristmas Markets can be found in many places, but the most important and beautiful are place Broglie and place de la Cath\u00e9drale, although they are crowded. They are the best places to drink hot wine (vin chaud) and to eat Christmas cookies (Br\u00e4deles).\n\n\nBuy\nFrom time to time, the city organizes a general market in vast parts of the center, where many street vendors offer various products and the shops join in with special discounts. Then, the city center on the island is partly closed for parking or driving and the trams don't go on the rue des Francs Bourgeois. Information about regular market dates is hard to find on the net. If you manage to track down the date of this market, write it here and don't miss it.\n\n March\u00e9 aux Puces (flea market), rue de Vieil-H\u00f4pital. W and Sa.

Bruno Saint Hilaire has designer clothes for men and a shop in 8, rue Gutenberg. There is a low-budget, secondhand clothing shop in 6, rue de la Lanterne, and various gadget shops can be found in rue des Juifs.\nFor cheap groceries, including local wines and beers, try one of the three outlets of Norma, a German discount chain whose three outlets are at the corner of rue St Michel and rue Ste Marguerite near the central train station; at 79, Grand'Rue near the centre of Grand \u00cele; and at 27, rue des Fr\u00e8res near the Cathedral. Open M-F 10:00-20:00, Sa 09:30-19:00.\n\n\nEat\nAlsatian specialties are numerous and can be eaten in many traditional restaurants, in the city or in the neighborhood. Particularly you shouldn't visit Alsace without having the sauerkraut (choucroute in French). Choucroute seems to have a standard price throughout Alsace of \u20ac14. Don't be too dismayed by this seemingly high price as what is brought to you is a heaping plate of Sauerkraut (big enough for 2 people) as well as sausages and other meats. This is usually translated as \"garnished sauerkraut\" on English menus, when in doubt ask your server.  There is also a delicious fish choucroute. Other specialties include the Alsatian pork-butcher's meat, Flammek\u00fcche or flams (tartes flamb\u00e9es in French) which is a sort of wafer thin pizza made with onion-cream sauce, Baeckeoffe, beef and pork stew cooked, with potatoes and carrots, usually served for two or more persons and Fleischnackas,  mixed beef meat presented like spirals and served with salads.\n\n\nBudget\nAll these are in the city centre:\n\n1 Au Brasseur, 22 Rue des Veaux, \u260f +33 3 88 36 12 13.

Great place to enjoy a game of backgammon. \n\n\nSleep\nThere are many hotels around the station, especially in the place de la Gare and in the rue du Maire Kuss, but this area does not offer consistent quality for accommodations. Most international hotel chains are represented with the usual 2- or 3-star hotels, many of which host the large tour groups who come on weekend breaks. If your budget allows, try staying on the Grande \u00cele (city centre). Most of Strasbourg's hotels are fully booked during the Christmas Market period (December) and when the EU parliament is in session for a few days every month, usually for the period around the tenth. Book ahead if in doubt, as last minute accommodation can be difficult to find during these periods.\n\n\nBudget\n1 CIARUS, 7 Rue Finkmatt, \u260f +33 3 88 15 27 88. offers a variety of hostel accommodation, with rooms from 1 to 8 beds.

(updated May 2017)\n\n\nStay safe\nStrasbourg is just like any other major French city: there are safe areas and there are unsafe areas. In any case, standard safety precautions need to be applied.\nIn the city center, watch out for pickpockets near the Cathedral (and even inside, according to the signs), during the high tourist season, and throughout the old town.\nThe areas immediately surrounding the railway station might look unsavory at night, but there are usually lots of people around there, and the streets are well-lit. Avoid looking like a lost tourist and you will be fine. If you do feel uncomfortable, don't hesitate to approach a police officer or taxi driver.\nSome areas in the south (especially the Neuhof neighborhood, which often ranks among France's worst neighborhoods) and west (Hautepierre, Cronenbourg) of the city might be iffy, especially at night, but they have little tourist appeal.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nPhone\nLocal mobile phone services are provided by Orange, SFR and Bouygues T\u00e9l\u00e9com. Payphone kiosks are plentiful and international calling cards can be purchased in post offices and 'tabacs' (corner shops). Most of the internet caf\u00e9s listed below are also equipped for making online telephony calls (Skype etc.).\n\n\nInternet\nIn most McDonald's in Strasbourg you get free WLAN.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nConsulates\n  Greece, 49, Avenue des Vosges, \u260f +33 388-354024, fax: +33 388-250524. \n  Japan, 20, Place des Halles, \u260f +33 3 88-52-85-00, fax: +33 3 88-22-62-39. \n  Romania, 41, rue Schweighaeuser (Blvd. Tauler), \u260f +33 3 69 32 19 38, fax: +33 3 88 61 44 25, strasbourg@mae.ro.
