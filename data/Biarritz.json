  "extract": "Biarritz is a large beachside town on the Bay of Biscay, on the Atlantic coast in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques d\u00e9partement of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, in south-west France. It is known for the H\u00f4tel du Palais, built for the Empress Eug\u00e9nie around 1855, its casinos, and its surfing culture.\n\n\nGet in\n\nBiarritz is adjacent to Bayonne and Anglet and 11 miles (18 km) from the border with Spain.\n\n\nBy car\nBiarritz is about 7\u00bd hours from Paris, at about 480 miles (775 km). Biarritz is easily accessed via the D911 road, off the N10. These routes are close to the A63 - a road connecting Belin-B\u00e9liet to Bayonne to the border of Spain. In a general idea, heading towards Bayonne, and then directing on the local by-roads to Biarritz is the most straightforward route.\nThe following are general roads to follow to reach Biarritz:\n\nParis - A10, N10, A63 (E05)\nLyon - A7, A9, A61, N117, A64 (E15-E80)\nMarseille - A54, A9, A61, N117, A64 (E15-E80)\nBilbao - A1 (E70)\nMadrid - N1, A1 (E70)\n\n\nBy train\nBiarritz train station is 3 km (2 mi) from the town centre.  The local bus company runs the number 2 bus to the beach front for \u20ac1.  For information on trains to and from Biarritz, visit the SNCF website.\n\nParis \u2192 Biarritz\nAbout 5 hours via TGV, trains running direct several times a day. There is also a Paris-Biarritz night train service.\nPrices are between 55 and \u20ac70 for the TGV full-fare, with night train fares starting at \u20ac15 one way.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses arrive on square d'Ixelles, in the centre of Biarritz. There are buses from Bayonne, Anglet, Pau, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Hendaye. Spanish bus company PESA [1] run a twice-daily service (leaving from outside the Biarritz Tourist Office) that follows the coast to San Sebastian and Bilbao in Spain.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne International Airport (BIQ  IATA) (3 km (1.9 mi) from the town centre), \u260f +33 5 59 43 83 83.   \nDirect flights from:\n\nCharleroi - 2 flights a week with Ryanair.\nGeneva - one flight operated by Air France during the summer.\nDublin - 4 flights per week with Ryanair - flying time 2 hr.\nLondon Stansted - daily flights with Ryanair - flying time 1hr 45min.\nLyon - daily flights with Air France - flying time 1hr 20min.\nMarseille - with Air France.\nNice - daily flights with Air France - flying time 1 hr.\nParis Orly - 4 to 5 flights a day with Air France - flying time 1hr 20min\nParis Charles de Gaulle - 3 flights a day with Air France and easyJet - flying time 1hr 20min.\nYou can get to the city from the airport by bus or taxi.

Or book a door-to-door transfer with Biarritz Airport Transfers.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nBiarritz is very pedestrianised, and it is easy to get around the town centre, to the beaches, and to the best spots for surfing or shopping. This means whatever your holiday needs is a short and pleasant walking distance away. However, it can be quite hilly in places.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere is an excellent bus network called Chronoplus ([2] for timetables and routes), serving Biarritz as well as the neighbouring Anglet and Bayonne (which form a conurbation called 'BAB'). Bus journeys are a flat \u20ac1 payable in cash on the bus. This ticket is valid for one hour to allow passengers inter-change between bus services and routes.\nCheaper multiple journey tickets are also available from the bus kiosks at Biarritz Mairie (beside the tourist office) and at Bayonne Mairie, but cannot be bought on the bus. These include a 10-journey ticket (\u20ac8); a seven-day travel pass (\u20ac11); and a 24-hour pass (\u20ac2). These tickets are also sold at 39 tobacco shops/cafes in the Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne (BAB) area.\nBus Line C links the airport with the Biarritz train station at La Negresse and the main Bayonne train station. The slightly less frequent No 8 bus also serves the Airport every 20\u201330 minutes.\n\n\nSee\nBiarritz is famous for its coast and the rocks in the sea.\nThere is the church of Sainte Eugenie, a Russian Orthodox church, and the Museum of the Sea (entrance about \u20ac6) with a lot of interesting animals like different kinds of fish, anemones, sharks, and seals in aquariums. Other topics include fishing in the last centuries, birds, catching whales.\nThen there is a Museum of Asian Art and a lighthouse (entrance \u20ac2).\n\n\nDo\nThe beaches are excellent and this is a major surf resort. The main beach, Grand Plage, gets very crowded, but there is also a long surfers' beach on the Boulevard du Prince de Galles, called Cote de Basque, that has almost no sand at high tide, but is superb at low tide. The surf beaches at Anglet are easily accessible by bus, and surfboards that aren't too big are allowed on the local buses in the summer at least. There is a small beach by the Esplanade du Porte Vieux that is good for swimming when the surfer's beach is closed.\nThere are several thalasso-therapy centers, with sea water, seaweed and related treatments.\n\nThermes Marins, Rue de Madrid.  Offer a reasonable half-day pass for \u20ac17, including use of warm sea water pools, sauna, and steam room.
