  "extract": "Maracaibo is the capital of Zulia state in Northwest Venezuela, and is the second largest city in the country after Caracas. It has more than 2 million people and it's famous for its typical music, big shopping malls and beautiful parks. It is called \"La Primera Ciudad de Venezuela\" (The Most Important Venezuelan City) because of its development.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 La Chinita International Airport (MAR  IATA).   \nAvior Airlines flies from Bogota and Caracas.\nConviasa has frequent flights from Caracas and Porlamar.\nCopa Airlines flies daily to Panama City with connections to other cities in Latin America and the US.\nEstelar Latinoamerica and LASER Airlines fly from Caracas.\nTurpial Airlines flies from Valencia\nVenezolana flies daily from Caracas and Panama City.\n\n\nBy bus\nMaracaibo is your arrival point in Venezuela if you take the most direct route from Santa Marta in Colombia.\nNight buses go to/from Caracas, San Cristobal and M\u00e9rida. The cheap bus to M\u00e9rida is much less comfortable.\n\n\nGet around\n\nTaxi: Taxi service is generally cheaper in Maracaibo than in other cities in Venezuela including Caracas due to high offer and lower demand. Always use a taxi from a taxi service, either by requesting it directly through the phone or walking to a taxi service spot. Never take a taxi off the street, no matter how 'legit' it might look. Anyone can put a taxi sign on their car (the plastic dome is attached by a couple of elastic strings).  Most businesses in Maracaibo will aid a tourist searching for a taxi so don't be afraid to ask in a McDonald's or another shop for help locating one.  Hotels have their own taxi services.\nSubway: It's the most modern and secure way to get around in the city. It is a new system so it has only 6 stations that connect the southwest to the center. Libertado station is 200 m north of the bus terminal (but be careful if you walk).\nBus: Mugging is very common in bus routes, general advice is, if you can afford a taxi, take a taxi. If you cannot, use common sense, do not wear watches, chains or anything that might incite muggers.\nWalking: Maracaibo has a good layout and good sidewalks, caution should be taken if walking during the day because of the extreme heat and solar radiation. Extreme caution should be taken if walking during the night, it's advised to take other forms of transportation if possible.\n\n\nSee\nMaracaibo has a nice but sterile centre, that they try to posh up with old European styled parks - not very successful.\n\n1 Puente General Rafael Urdaneta (Bridge over Lake Maracaibo).

They leave when they fill up.  If you want one with air conditioning (recommended), don't mention this but just wait for one that looks a bit newer (otherwise they will want to charge you extra for it and they can be quite aggressive).  On the way to the border you will pass through about 10 military or police checkpionts where you have to show your passport.  If there are any illegal immigrants in your car, they will have to negotiate a bribe with each of these guards (normally US$2-10 at each checkpoint) and this will add about an hour to the journey.  Amerlujo and Expresos Brasilia have direct buses to Colombia but they cost about twice as much as going via Maicao and they leave very early in the morning.  Expect to take about 12 hours in total to get from Maracaibo to Cartagena.",
