  "extract": "Cornwall (Cornish: Kernow) is a county in the southwest of the United Kingdom. Lying west of Devon from which it is separated by the River Tamar, Cornwall is one of the more isolated and distinctive parts of the United Kingdom but is also one of its most popular with holidaymakers. Its relatively warm climate, long coastline, amazing scenery, and diverse Celtic heritage (combined with tales of smuggling, pirates and King Arthur!) go only part of the way to explaining its appeal.\nCornwall is a popular destination for those interested in cultural tourism, due to its long association with visual and written arts and its wealth of archaeology. Its mining heritage has been recognised by the United Nations (UNESCO). Over 30% of the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), giving it national status and protection. Cornwall has always been fiercely proud of its Celtic heritage, and for many residents, their Cornish identity supersedes their Englishness or Britishness.\n\n\nRegions\n\nWikivoyage divides Cornwall into three regions. The Isles of Scilly are covered in a separate article.\n\n\nTowns and cities\n1 Truro \u2014 Cornwall's County Town and only city. It has a cathedral and hosts the Royal Cornwall Museum\n2 Newquay \u2014 former fishing village, now surf capital of the UK and home to Cornwall's international airport\n3 Port Isaac \u2014 seaside village, often used as a filming location\n4 Tintagel \u2014 legendary birthplace of King Arthur and seat of the Kings of Cornwall\n5 Falmouth \u2014 famous for its beaches, it is home to the world's third largest natural harbour\n6 St Austell \u2014 largest town in the county and home to the Eden Project, the world's largest greenhouse\n7 Penzance \u2014 pirate central, Penzance is a town long-associated with the arts\n8 St Ives \u2014 artists' \"colony\" and home to a branch of the Tate Gallery\n9 Mousehole \u2014 a charming fishing village, known for its picturesque harbour\n\n\nOther destinations\nThe Isles of Scilly, 40 km west of Land's End, are often considered part of Cornwall, but are covered in a separate article due to more involved travel arrangements needed to get in and around them.\n1 Land's End \u2014 the most westerly point in England, beyond lies the Atlantic Ocean\n2 Lizard  \u2014 the most southerly point in Britain\n3 Bodmin Moor \u2014 a bleak moor to the east of Bodmin made famous by Daphne du Maurier's book Jamaica Inn\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nCornwall is a county within the United Kingdom. Prince William, by virtue of being heir to the throne, holds the title Duke of Cornwall, and his wife Catherine is the Duchess. The \"Duchy of Cornwall\" is a crown body that owns land in Cornwall, Devon and other parts of the UK.\nThe modern English name of the county is thought to come from its old Celtic name, Kernou, meaning \"the Horn\", referring to its shape. The Celtic name was Latinised to Cornovia or Cornubia. When the Saxons gave the name of Wealas (foreigners) to the Britons, they singled out those who lived in Kernou or Cornubia by the name of Cornu-wealas; their country was thus called Cornuwall or Cornwall. Cornwall is called Kernow in Cornish, a Celtic language related to Welsh and Breton. Many street signs are both in Cornish and English. \nOpinion polls place Cornish identity amongst young people at around 40% regarding themselves as Cornish rather than English, with calls for a Cornish assembly or government by some nationalists. Some might take offence to being called English, so avoid using the term and consider using \"British\" instead.\nA common term for tourists is emmet, a Cornish dialect word meaning \"ant\". The correct Cornish word for ant is actually murrian. Be aware of locals recommending \"Porthemmet Beach\": it simply means 'tourist beach', and it doesn't exist. Signposts, guides, and directions to Porthemmet Beach will direct you out of the county and into Devon.\nThe Cornish have many significant saints. The pre-eminent patron saint is Saint Piran, whose flag, black with a white cross, is widely regarded as the national emblem of Cornwall and can be seen all across the county. It is flown from private homes and Government and public buildings. Saint Piran's Day is widely celebrated on March 5 in Cornwall and amongst the Cornish diaspora around the globe.\nCornwall was a contributor to the Industrial Revolution, being famous particularly for its copper and tin mining. Cornish miners have emigrated to many parts of the world to the extent that the Cornish claim that a mine is defined as being a hole in the ground with a Cornishman at its bottom. The Cornish mines pioneered the use of stationary steam engines to power the mines.    \nThe Cornish are extremely proud of their history and heritage, which pre-date the arrival of the Romans or Anglo-Saxons in Britain, and many Cornish people are loyal to their county. You may even see some Cornish people wearing kilts and playing Cornish pipes at cultural and other gatherings. Do not confuse the kilts with Scottish kilts. Cornwall is recognised as a separate nation by many international organisations, including the EU. One such popular organisation is Gorsedh Kernow, aimed at promoting Cornish culture and festivals such as the Gorsedd.\nCornwall has a small but developing lesbian and gay community. Flamboyancy in men may raise some eyebrows (or frowns) but for the most part, is accepted. There is an annual Pride event in Newquay.\nCornwall is a popular location for literature, television and film. Poldark, a series of historical novels by Winston Graham and Jamaica Inn by Daphne Du Maurier. Two TV adaptations of Poldark have been filmed in Cornwall, along with Treasure Island and other classics.\n\n\nVisitor information\nCornwall Tourist Board website\n\n\nTalk\nEverybody in Cornwall speaks English, while a very small minority also speak Cornish. More people speak mainland European languages, notably Polish, than speak Cornish.\n\n\nEnglish\nThe English dialect of Cornwall is distinctive; while to outsiders it sounds similar to other West Country accents, it is thought to have been influenced by Cornish in its phonology and intonation.\n\n\nCornish\n\nCornish (Kernowek) is a language belonging to the Brythonic branch of the Celtic languages, and closely related to Breton and Welsh. It was traditionally the dominant language of Cornwall, though the number of speakers had diminished by the 17th century, and it became extinct some time later. It is claimed that the last speaker was Dolly Pentreath, a fishwife from Mousehole, who passed away in Mousehole on 26 December 1777, although others claim that there were Cornish-speakers who lived into the early 20th century. \nCornish was revived in the early 20th century, and since then has had government funding. The number of fluent speakers is increasing, being possibly now over 1000, while several thousand more can at least hold a basic conversation in Cornish. Some young people have grown up bilingual in Cornish and English. Bilingual road signs are now more common, and there are full-time language staff at Cornwall Council.\nWhy not try a few words out while you are there? You might get lucky and get a response in Cornish too.\n\nWelcome\nDynnargh (deen-ar)\nHello\nDydh da (didh dah), literally good day\nGood morning\nMyttin da (MIT-in dah)\nGood afternoon\nGorthuger da (gor-THEW-uhr dah)\nGood evening\nNos da (nos dah)\nGood bye\nDuw genes (dyoo GEH-nehs) if addressing one person\nGood bye\nDuw genowgh (dyoo GUH-noh-gh) to more than one person\nSee you!\nDha weles!

(updated Jun 2023)\nGolowan, sometimes also Goluan or Gol-Jowan is the Cornish word for the Midsummer celebrations, most popular in the Penwith area and in particular Penzance and Newlyn. The celebrations are conducted from the 23rd of June (St John's Eve) to the 28th of June (St Peter's Eve) each year, St Peter's Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations are centred around the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. Some towns have a street-parade during this period.\nGuldize is an ancient harvest festival in Autumn, which involved the \"crying of the neck\" ritual of chanting in the corn field. A revived Guldize celebration is held in Penzance, and in several other locations across Cornwall.\nNickanan Night is traditionally held on the Monday before Lent. This event is an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor vandalism and play practical jokes on neighbours and family.

The eating of pea soup and salt bacon is also associated with this date.\nNoze looan is a style of Cornish-Celtic dance, and associated music and events similar to the Breton Fest, Noz.

The St Columb's game takes place first on Pancake Day (moves around in February) and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen') who endeavour to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set roughly two miles (3 km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world. The annual St. Ives hurling match happens on Feast Monday each February (the feast is on the Sunday nearest to February 3). \nSt Piran's Day (Cornish: Gool Peran) is the national day of Cornwall, held on 5 March every year. There is large parties widespread across the whole of Cornwall, with people dressing in the black, white and silver national colours. \nTom Bawcock's Eve: on 23rd December, stargazey pies are traditionally consumed. In mythology, pies were seen bizarrely as the reason the devil stayed out of Cornwall.\n\n\nSleep\nMain article: Sleep\nCornwall has a large range of tourist accommodation, ranging from 5-star luxury hotels to B&Bs, guest houses and hostels. There is also a large number of serviced holiday cottages that can be rented from anything from a long weekend to upwards of a month. \nThere are Tourist Information Centres (TICs) in most major towns. These are normally run by the local council and can check the latest availability on the day to save having to phone around a number of B&Bs and guest houses. They are unbiased and won't express an opinion on accommodations, more than giving its tourist board rating and facilities.\n\n\nStay safe\nVisitors to Cornwall should at all times be aware of the unpredictable and dangerous nature of some of the tides and currents around the Cornish coast and seek advice from local lifeguards before swimming or surfing. There is a small chance of getting great white or tiger sharks off the south coast, but don't let this worry you as they are very very rarely seen, and there have been no known attacks.\nCornwall's roads become very dangerous in summer due to the influx of tourists to the region. The local infrastructure is very poor and often cannot cope with the traffic. Drive sensibly and with caution.\nBe very alert when driving at night as some roads, especially the A39 in North Cornwall, contain sudden hairpin bends that are deceptively sharp and are not illuminated by street lighting.  There is also a risk of running over nocturnal wildlife.  Use your headlights' full beam where possible and err on the side of caution.\nNewquay in the summer attracts tens of thousands of tourists, and with that inevitably comes increased crime during the months of June, July and August. Assaults and muggings are particularly common, usually at night and often down on some of Newquay's many beaches.\nCrime rates are mostly low in Cornwall, but there are some impoverished areas of some towns where crime is more common. Occasionally, outsiders can attract attention in local pubs, but this is no worse than in other areas of the country.",
