  "extract": "Lille (Dutch: Rijsel) is  the core of one of the largest metropolitan agglomerations in France. It has a large and handsome historic centre with beautiful, Flemish-influenced architecture. As a major economic and academic centre, with a very large student population, it has lively nightlife. Situated at the literal crossroads of Europe in the Hauts-de-France region, Lille is within a 90-minute train ride from Paris, Brussels and London.  \n\n\nUnderstand\n\nLille is France's fifth largest metropolitan area, and its most northerly. The city sits on the De\u00fble River, very near to the border with Belgium. While the city is moderately sized (236,000 inhabitants in 2020), over 1.5 million people live in the French side of the metropolitan area, while the cross-border metropolitan area, which covers both French and Belgian territory and includes Kortrijk and Tournai, is estimated to have more than 2.1 million inhabitants. It is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department.\nHistorically, it was the capital of Flanders, and became an industrial powerhouse. \n1 Lille Tourist Office, Palais Rihour (Rihour  M1 ), \u260f +33 359 579 400, contact@lilletourism.com. 10:00-12:30, 13:30-17:30. City tourist office located at Palais Rihour. Sell City Passes but you need to visit a lot of attractions to make them worthwhile. (updated May 2023)\n\n\nHistory\nWhile the area of present-day Lille has been inhabited since as early as 2000 BC, the first mention of the city dates back to 1066, when it was referred to as apid Insulam in Latin. Meaning \"at the island\", this toponym is reflected in both the French and Dutch names of the city, both being contractions of the same expression (L'\u00eele and ter ijsel).\n\n\nClimate\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n \nMost visitors will probably arrive by train at Gare de Lille Europe or Gare de Lille Flandres. It is possible to land at the Charles de Gaulle Paris airport and then continue by train, but do not try this at the Ryanair's Paris airport (Beauvais) as there is no train connection at all and the only bus is back to Paris itself.\n\n\nBy plane\nLille has its own international airport, but it is mostly served by flights to holiday destinations around the Mediterranean and other airports within France. That said, proximity to Paris and Brussels allows one to use the airports of either metropolis to visit Lille, especially those with direct train connections to Lille. Visitors from other continents may also entertain the option of landing in one of London's airports and transferring to a Eurostar train to Lille from the British capital.\n\n1 A\u00e9roport de Lille (LIL  IATA). This airport is small but convenient for entering Lille or travelling on to nearby areas across the border in Belgium. Both major and budget airlines operate scheduled services. Unlike larger airports there is hardly any walking as the check-in desks are directly inside the entrance and the security gates are directly behind the check-ins. A direct coach connects to central Lille (stops outside the main railway station) in 20 minutes, and runs once an hour costing \u20ac7 one-way, while a return ticket is \u20ac9. A taxi into the centre costs about \u20ac20.   \n2 Brussels South Charleroi Airport (CRL IATA). 120 km (75 mi) from Lille, BSCA offers a wide range of European destinations through low-costs giants Ryanair and Wizzair, as well as a few other LCCs. It is a popular option with Lille's student population. Reaching the Belgian airport can be tricky without a car, though Flibco offers an hourly service to the airport. The journey lasts 1 hr 40 min and can cost as little as \u20ac5; Otherwise, you can take a train from Lille-Flandres train station to Charleroi, then hop on the bus to the airport. This journey should take you a little more than 2 hr.   (updated Jan 2020)\n\n\nBy train\n\nLille has two major train stations:\n\n3  Gare de Lille Europe. Lille Europe lies at the heart of the Brussels-Paris-London high-speed rail corridor. TGV and Eurostar trains stop here; the TGV / Thalys journey from Brussels takes little more than 30 minutes, the TGV from Paris about an hour, and the Eurostar from London an hour and 22 minutes through the Channel Tunnel.   \nCheck the SNCF website to see train timetables\nIf you are travelling from the United Kingdom, Eurostar is the best option to reach Lille through the Channel Tunnel. The journey time to Gare de Lille Europe is 1 hr 22 min from London St Pancras International, though you have to check in at least 90 minutes before departure in order to complete border formalities due to COVID restrictions and Brexit.  Train connections run regularly by ferry from Calais.\nLille is also linked by TGV to Lyon (3 hours), Nantes (4 hours), Strasbourg (3 hr 20 min), and Marseille (5 hours).\n\n4  Gare de Lille Flandres. This station is mostly served by regional TER trains, but some TGV trains use it, including services from Paris.   \nThe two train stations are located within easy walking distance of each other, meaning it is therefore possible to connect between services at either station, provided you leave yourself enough time to walk between the stations and find your train, as well as go through security and customs if you are transferring onto a Eurostar service to London.\nAnother option is to take the TER or the regional, slower moving trains, where a ticket can be purchased fairly cheap to many locations in France and Belgium. The transit bureau for the Nord-Pas-de-Calais offers weekend \"Trampoline\" passes, where a round trip on TER trains between Lille and several Belgian cities can be purchased for a set price of \u20ac20-40, with the freedom of choosing your own train times. Be careful though: depending on the train, cities may be referred to by either their French or Dutch names, which can get confusing.\n\n\nBy bus\nBlaBlacar Bus and Flixbus run coach services between Paris, Brussels, London, Amsterdam, Bruges, and more. The bus stop station is located at Gare de Lille Europe.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy public transport\n\nLille has two metro lines that connect the centre of the city with several suburbs:\n\nMetro line  M1  mostly serves suburbs on the south side of the city, as well as cutting straight through the centre.\nMetro line  M2  starts in the western suburbs, skirts along the boulevard on the southern edge of the centre, and continues to Roubaix and Tourcoing, finally ending at a hospital adjacent to the Belgian border.\nBoth lines serve both railway stations.\nThere are also two tram routes, both starting at the railway stations:\n\n R  serving Roubaix.\n T  serving Tourcoing.\nThere are also bus lines that service all parts of the city.\n\nil\u00e9via Public transportation in Lille, In French, English and Dutch. There are also Android and iPhone app in English.\nAs of May 2023, single tickets are \u20ac1.80 +  \u20ac0.20 charge for the rechargeable ticket. X10 Single ticket \u20ac15.40. 24-hour day passes are available for \u20ac5.30. Other ticket types are available for longer stays. Machines accept cash and cards. The tickets cover the il\u00e9via metro, buses and trams to any destination, Longer distance intercity trains (to Roubaix for example) require separate tickets.\n\n\nSee\n\nLille is a cultural and commercial hub with a wide range of restaurants, bars, clubs, museums, and shopping centre. A highlight is its beautiful and historic old town. The night life, thanks to the city's large student population, is cutting edge and lively. \n\n\nMust see\n\n1 La Vieille Bourse (Rihour  M1 ). Built in 1653, this is a historic and beautiful building with an atrium style opening and inner court.

Typical dishes include Potjevleesch, the Welsh, which is a hearty melt of cheddar cheese and fried egg, carbonnade flamande, a hearty beef stew, and, of course, moules frites.

Restaurant offering excellent buffet meals and \"\u00e0 la carte\". \n La Chicor\u00e9e, place Rihour (beside le Flore, near 'Rihour' metro station). Food served nearly 24/24 and 7/7. Typical meals, typical beers. But do not expect to find excellent food here: this restaurant may just be useful if you don't know where to have dinner at 03:00 in the morning. Do not miss the awesome plate collection on the walls. Each was signed by an artist or a famous person, as La Chicor\u00e9e is the place where they usually eat after the show. You might even meet someone famous if you try it after 02:00 or 03:00! It's also the place where a lot of casual people eat at night, after their job, after a trip in caf\u00e9, after a show. It's of course rather popular with tourists, but if you wish to appreciate Lille's cuisine at its best, try some other place. Menus from \u20ac13.50. \n L'Omnia, 9 Rue Esquermoise. The entrance of this restaurant/bar is difficult to miss and situated close to la Grand Place. Ramps and murals combine to create a perspective that evokes the feeling of being in Alice in Wonderland. Inside the decor appeals to the same childish sense of wonder- all red lights and plush, appropriate to this ex-theatre and ex-brothel (you'll find the history of the building on the placemats). The food is affordable: the lunch time menu starts from \u20ac9. The 'potjevles' are regional specialty but recommended only to the adventurous. Otherwise, the chicken tikka skewers are very enjoyable. The bar also seems to be very proud of their wide range of beers, and the wine was reasonably priced and good. \n Pubstore, 44 rue de la Halle. This somewhat intimate restaurant is a great place for lunch or dinner. Candles on each table make it a nice spot for couples to have a quiet dinner. The menu, found under the glass tabletop, is full of diverse, delicious dishes. Each dish also has a clever name, usually a play on words. \n L\u2019 Ga\u00efette, 30, rue Mass\u00e9na. The menu in this restaurant focuses on regional specialties and is written in Ch'ti, the local patois. Great food and a warm, friendly waitstaff make this restaurant a great place to have dinner. \n Pancook, 125 rue Colbert.

Fancy restaurant (updated Dec 2017)\n L'Huitriere, rue des Chats Bossus. Behind the early 20th-century art-nouveau fish store lay one of the best seafood and fish restaurants in the country, appreciated by many famous people. The upscale restaurant is definitely closed, but you can still have oysters (and other small seafood) with a drink on the 1st floor \n\n\nDrink\nLille has an amazing nightlife, wonderful bars and nightclubs, and a world of drinks to try. Because it is the north of France, beer is the most popular drink. Try as many kinds as you can, including Belgian ales which are very popular.\nRue Solferino has many bars and clubs. This is the street to visit if you enjoy a lively nightlife and party scene. On Rue Mass\u00e9na, you will also find countless bars, nightclubs, and restaurants including small delicious kebab stands that are open late until the wee hours of early morning.\n\n Maison du Moulin D'Or (Morel & Fils), 31 Place du th\u00e9\u00e2tre, \u260f +33 3 20 55 00 10. This place used to be \"une bonneterie,\" which is still reflected in the decorations inside.

(updated Jul 2019)\n\n\nStay safe\nDespite its charm and dynamic vibe, Lille is not without its share of crime and other socioeconomic issues, and the media have at times portrayed Lille as a dangerous city. As a former industrial powerhouse, Lille suffered greatly from the fall of heavy industry, and right up until the late 1990s the city was marred by crime and poverty. Even if the city and its metropolitan area have made a remarkable economic comeback, crime-related issues are more common here than in other French cities.\nDuring the daytime, taking the basic precautions you would take elsewhere should suffice to avoid trouble. However, do be cautious at night and stick to well-lit streets as much as possible. As a rule of thumb, the city center, old town, and northern half of the city are safe for the most part. On the other hand, try to avoid Lille's southern neighbourhoods as much as possible.\nBy far the most common issue you will encounter is pickpocketing, which is particularly common on the metro, in the railway station, and in crowded areas (especially on Saturday nights). Alcohol and drug fueled behaviors are also common; this is exacerbated by the large student population., which tends to frequently get rowdy on weekends and at the end of the school year (May to June).\nFinally, Lille has one of France's most visible homeless populations. They tend to be more aggressive than in other cities, so watch out for any dubious-looking individuals. They are an unfortunately common sight near the Lille-Flandres station.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nConsulates\n  Greece, 21 Rue Jules Ferry, 59370 Mons-en-Bar\u0153ul, \u260f +33 320-334-625, fax: +33 320-332-892, consulatgrece_lille@yahoo.fr. \n\n\nConnect\nAs of Sep 2021, Lille has 5G from all French carriers.

Watch out at the border in case you need to change trains or coaches.\nArras, with an impressive central square, has most of the Allied memorials from the First World War.\nLille is the centre of the Eurostar-TGV network, so Paris, London and Brussels are all within an hour's ride.",
