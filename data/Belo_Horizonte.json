  "extract": "Belo Horizonte is Brazil's sixth largest city  and the capital of the state of Minas Gerais. With its orderly grid plan and tree-lined avenues, it's a pleasant metropolis. For travelers, it's a good stopping point on the way to the beautiful colonial towns such as Ouro Preto and Tiradentes.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nFounded in 1897, Belo Horizonte (or simply \"BH\" (beh-ah-GAH) to locals) is a little over a century old. With a metropolitan population reaching more than 5 million (edging out Salvador), it was built as a planned city to take the place of Ouro Preto as the state's capital. Its layout features square sections delineated by broad avenues, intersected diagonally by smaller streets.\nThe city lies in the center of the Minas Gerais state, and was intended to bring together the many parts of this very diverse state.\n\n\nClimate\n\nBelo Horizonte is located at 852 meters (2,795 feet) in altitude and therefore temperatures rarely reach extremes of cold or heat. Maximum temperatures typically reach 29\u00b0C (84 \u00b0F) in summer and 25\u00b0C in winter (77 \u00b0F), and the average low in winter is 15 \u00b0C (59\u00b0F). The rainy season is in the hottest months, between October and March. During these months, thunderstorms are almost daily, with long periods of continuous rain and can flood some parts of the city, causing inconvenience. Due to the Serra do Curral mountains, there is rarely a very strong wind in the city.\n\n\nLocal information\nBelo Horizonte City Government website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy bus\nBH is a major national hub for bus travel. There are two intercity bus stations:\n\n1 Terminal Rodovi\u00e1rio de Belo Horizonte. It is downtown at the northern end of Afonso Pena Avenue. \n2 Terminal Tur\u00edstico JK. \nWhen departing from BH, check beforehand, from where your bus departs from.\nApproximate travel times from other capitals:\n\nBras\u00edlia - 10 hours\nRio de Janeiro - 7 hours\nS\u00e3o Paulo - 8 hours\n\n\nBy plane\nBH is served by two airports:\n\n3 Confins Airport (Aeroporto Internacional Tancredo Neves CNF  IATA) (Rodovia MG 010 S/N, 40 km - Confins/MG.), \u260f +55 31 3689-2700. Confins connects the city with direct flights to the USA, the Caribbean and Europe, and to most major cities in Brazil through domestic flights. It's about 40 km from the city center. To get to the city center (around Mercad\u00e3o), expect to pay around R$ 75 for uber-like ride services, or R$ 125 for a cab. There are also two types of bus services: \"conventional\" for R$ 13,50 and \"executive\" for R$ 29,40 and some itineraries desserve Pampulha Airport and the City Bus Station - details at Conex\u00e3o Aeroporto website.   (updated Jan 2019)\n4 Pampulha Airport (PLU  IATA Aeroporto Carlos Drummond de Andrade) (9 km from downtown). For a few domestic flights, especially within the state of Minas Gerais.   \n\n\nBy car\nYou can safely drive to Belo Horizonte from major Brazilian cities, including S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and Vitoria. You have to pay toll on the roads from Rio de Janeiro and from S\u00e3o Paulo. All major car rental companies can be found in Brazil. You can also drive from/to the historical cities of Minas Gerais, like Ouro Preto, Tiradentes, Diamantina, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rey, Mariana and others. The roads and the city of Belo Horizonte are GPS mapped. Be sure that the GPS contains the latest version of the maps.\n\n\nBy train\nBelo Horizonte is one of very few Brazilian cities with a scheduled long-distance train service. A daily morning train operated by mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce takes around 12 hr to get to Cariacica's Pedro Nolasco station, which is one bridge hop away from Vit\u00f3ria, the island capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo state. As of Jan 2019, tickets cost R$ 105 for first class (executiva) and R$ 73 for second class (econ\u00f4mica). The central station, 5 Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Central, is located in the city centre on Av. dos Andradas.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nIf you plan to get around the city center on foot, you might want to take a map. Because the city grid is laid out with both ordinal and diagonal streets, it is very easy to take a wrong turn. Also, the land where the city was built  has plenty of hills, so one should wear comfortable shoes to go up and down the streets. At night, stay on the main avenues and streets for safety, because it can be dangerous.\n\n\nBy bus\nBH is well served by buses. The SC buses circulate through the downtown area; others serve outlying neighborhoods.\nTo pay the bus tariff, you can use cash, or the electronic billing card (Cart\u00e3o BHBUS). For the tourist, its recommended to use cash. As of 2014, you can buy a rechargeable bus card with the onboard agent or the driver for R$12. You can recharge it on some BRT stations, BHTrans offices or even into some buses.\nFrom 2016, the bus tariff is R$3.70 (or R$ 2.65 for some feeder lines or specific lines)\nThe buses are color-coded:\n\nBlue buses go from one region of the city to another, via the city center;\nLemonish-and-gray normal and articulated buses are from the municipal BRT service. Usually, they link some specific stations to some region of the city, and are feed by the yellow or green buses, as well. These buses have air conditioned system, and a little more of comfort.\nYellow buses are called \"circular\" (or SC) buses - they circulate within a single city region, and unlike other bus lines, travel in a roughly circular route. Stay on long enough, and you'll eventually loop back to where you originally boarded;\nOrange buses go from one region of the city to another, without going through downtown (there are very few of these lines). It also serves for the Orange minibuses as well (as known as \"Suplementar\")\nGreen buses serve BHBUS bus stations, going from a BHBUS station to downtown and then back or connecting two different BHBUS stations.\nGrey buses (can be identified by the SE prefix in line number), are the special executive service, and it's a more expensive buses, that circulate through some specific regions. These lines have free Wi-Fi and Air Conditioned system.\nSome companies sometimes use temporary replacements buses with the wrong color, so even thought the colors can help, always pay attention to the line number.\nIf you are outside the downtown area (and wish to go there), take a blue bus headed in that direction. As there is no bus map, remember its number to find your way back. Keep in mind that the return route may be on a different street than where you got off. Check BHTrans-\u00d4nibus official website of the city hall BHTrans which may not be very functional when it is off the air, if this occurs the best alternative is the BHTrans website, plan your trip by consulting the route and the bus schedule from Belo Horizonte.\nThe buses are complicated and are excruciatingly slow and crowded during rush hours. Don't go anywhere by yourself without properly planning your itinerary first.\n\n\nBy train\nThe Metr\u00f4.  snakes through the city, from Eldorado northeast to Vilarinho, tangential to the north side of downtown. Lagoinha Station is near the rodovi\u00e1ria (bus station), Gameleira Station is near the ExpoMinas Convention Center and Minas Shopping Station is near the Mall of the same name and Ouro Minas Palace Hotel. Unfortunately, unlike subways in developed countries or in S\u00e3o Paulo, the Metr\u00f4 lines, even though connecting the two biggest cities in the metro area, Belo Horizonte and Contagem, do not cover most of the city and outside the stations can be dangerous (true for S\u00e3o Paulo's). New lines have been planned and when completed will connect downtown to Pampulha and Savassi, the two most visited neighborhoods.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis inside the safe are generally considered very safe (if a bit expensive).\nThe main taxi companies in Belo Horizonte include Hutaxi, Jo Taxi, Intertaxi, Pitangui and Protaxi. Most cabs in Belo Horizonte are painted white - however, starting from 2012, there are some so-called \"special\" cabs which are black (and are marked as such). Inside the city, all cabs work with taximeters. However, in case of travelling to the countryside or others states, the fare can be discussed.\nThere are also radio taxis such as Coopertramo [1] ((31) 3454-5757) which can be booked and the fare discussed beforehand. It's a common way of getting from the airport to the city and the other way around. They have booths in Confins airport. Their cars are all dark blue.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nBelo Horizonte is covered by some e-hailing services, Uber being the largest of them. Notable e-hailing services in the city, are:\n\nUber (covers neighboring cities, like Contagem, Betim and Confins Airport as well)\nCabify\n\n\nBy car\nYou can rent cars at the Confins Airport or at Pampulha Airport. All major car rental companies, like Localiza and Hertz have booths at the airports. It is a long drive from Confins airport to downtown Belo Horizonte. Be sure to get a GPS with new maps, since there were some modifications on main avenues for the World Cup. You can also rent a car at other places around the city.\n\n\nSee\n\nNote that a lot of places including museums, the parque municipal and the Mangueira park are closed on Mondays.\n\nPampulha - This 1940s neighborhood has some of the highlights of Brazil modern architecture, including the S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis Church, designed by the famous architect Oscar Niemeyer (designer of the United Nations building in NYC and also Brasilia, Brazil's capital) . The building is not shocking by itself, until you realize it was meant to be a church. Not surprisingly, the Catholic Church refused to consecrate it for more than one decade. Next to the church, there's the Parque Guanabara, an amusement park that is small, but worth visiting. In Pampulha lies the world-famous Iate Tenis Clube, founded along with the Pampulha Architectural Complex designed by Oscar Niemeyer.

Also, at S\u00e3o Lucas neighborhood, on Contorno Avenue, you will find \"Sociedad Pub\", one of the best Pubs in town (Contorno Av., n.3849). The city is widely known (although without any confirmation) as the city with most bars per capita in the world.  Some clubs that charge a cover are overrated and expensive.  The outdoor bar scene is the authentic Brazilian experience. Good places to look for a bar:\nAvenida Prudente de Morais\nRua Mar\u00edlia de Dirceu (follow it while it becomes Rua Curitiba and then Rua S\u00e3o Paulo\u2014yeah, that's how streets work in Belo Horizonte)\nRua Pium-\u00ed crossing with Rua Passatempo\nAvenida Fleming (only if you are in the Pampulha region)\nYou may know it only as an ingredient in vitamin pills, but here you can get fresh acerola puree in orange juice squeezed before your eyes. This is called a vitamina with good reason. The fruit is perishable and is stored on ice. Other fruits prepared the same way are abacaxi (pineapple), a\u00e7a\u00ed, banana, and mam\u00e3o (papaya).\nAlthough Savassi is the place to go on Friday and Saturday nights, Trevo Five Place (close to the Hard Rock Cafe) is a great spot on Thursday nights.  The dancing is great however the environment is not for the cautious.\nThe state of Minas Gerais is famous for their cacha\u00e7a (distilled spirit similar to rum made from sugarcane juice). It is the main ingredient of the famous caipirinha cocktail, but Brazilians enjoy drinking it straight as well.\nAnother great drink is a sweet tasting wine-like substance called pronounced \"catuaba\".\nIf your looking for some dancing and clubbing visit naSala [2]. For sure the best nightlife in town. Expect to meet beautiful people.\n Rei Do Pastel, Savassi. Rei Do Pasetel is a small little corner bar located in the centre of Savassi. It has cheap shots, cheap food and always has something interesting going on, a great place for backpackers. \n\n\nSleep\nMajor high-rise hotels are generally on Av.

The Normandy Hotel highlight is its great location, right at the cultural, commercial and financial hub of Belo Horizonte, making it a good option for travellers looking for commodity and agility when staying in town. (updated May 2015)\n\n\nStay healthy\nTo keep hydrated, drink bottled water or water from drinking fountains, usually located at malls.\nTap water provided by COPASA (sole provider for the city) is regarded as fully potable (filtered, sterilized, PH controlled and fluoridated), but it is important to note that due to historical unreliability of water supply in Brazil, the vast majority of buildings have water tanks, so even if it is provided by COPASA, if you are unsure of the sanitary conditions of the building water tank, you should avoid drinking it before filtering, boiling or ozonizing it.\nEven though bottled water in Brazil is labeled as \u201cmineral water\u201d, you should be careful and use good sense when buying it. Cases of tap water and untreated water being bottled and labeled as \u201cmineral\u201d are not uncommon. Always check the color of the water, the general aspect of the bottle and the seal. Some Brazilians are used to untreated water but it is very likely that tourists will have serious issues with it, including diarrhea, vomits, fever, headaches and muscular pain. It is usually safer to drink COPASA tap water then bootleg bottled water.\nFree healthcare is widely available, but waiting times may be long (even on minor emergencies), for non urgent cases go to the free \u201cPosto de Sa\u00fade\u201d near where you are staying (there are plenty all over the city). Private hospitals usually have faster service and better facilities and you can pay your treatment with either cash or with your insurance. Check with your insurance company the hospitals and clinics covered beforehand. If you have any allergies or known health problems, it is wise to learn some Portuguese words to describe it as it is very likely most of the hospital staff won\u2019t speak English except for more qualified MDs, nurses and social workers. Although you might not see any initial difference, nurses are divided into \u201ccollege nurses\u201d, \u201ctechnical nurses\u201d and \u201cauxiliary nurses\u201d. You are more likely to find an English speaker among the college nurses (they are called Enfermeira or Enfermeiro and usually act as sector supervisors in a hospital).\nBelo Horizonte can get very hot during summer, so avoid staying out in the sun for too long, specially between 10:00 and 15:00. Even though it is not on the coast, sunscreen is advisable, especially if you have light skin.\nPublic restrooms can be found at malls and public buildings. A small fee may apply. Also, bars and restaurants are required by law to have a restroom available to its customers, but even if you are not buying anything, just ask nicely and they will let you use it.\nSmoking in Belo Horizonte is banned from closed buildings. This includes malls, restaurants, bars (except if you are sitting outside), clubs, public buildings, airports and others. Smoking has been increasingly regarded as a bad habit and even on the sidewalk people might get annoyed by it, so it is best to smoke privately or away from non smokers.\n\n\nStay safe\nWhen crossing the street, watch for motorcycles, which can appear out of nowhere and sometimes ignore stop signs. At some intersections with divided streets, you can cross only one side at once.\nMinas has both the military police (pol\u00edcia militar) who are the enforcers of the law at street level, however not linked to the Brazilian Military and the civilian police (pol\u00edcia civil) who conduct further investigations like the British CID. Most officers don't have a knowledge of basic English. The uniform of the Minas Gerais state military police is brown.\nThe emergency number (by which you can reach the military police) is 190.\nThe city has its own police, the Municipal Guard, the uniform is blue and officers are found in parks, near monuments, schools, hospitals.\nThe city suffers from crime related to drugs. Avoid walking alone at night or carrying expensive electronics such as cameras, notebooks, iPods or jewelry. It is not uncommon to be mugged at traffic lights or walking during the day or night. Tourists can be easily identified by bad guys as people who carry electronics carelessly and seem to be always wondering where are they going. Be discreet.\nIf someone mugs you, don't resist. You could be killed.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nBy net\nMP Games, Rua dos Inconfidentes 868, between Pernambuco and Para\u00edba, Savassi. You can bring your laptop.\nWifi is readily available in many bars and restaurants throughout the city.\n\n\nBy phone\nThe area code for Belo Horizonte is 31. The code for Oi, the phone company that runs most of the phone booths in the city, is also 31. So to call Belo from outside using Oi, you dial 031 31 and the desired number, for example: from S\u00e3o Paulo to Belo, dial 03131 xxxx-xxxx. But to make a local call, you don't have to dial 31 at all, just the eight digits.
