  "extract": "Roraima is a state in the North of Brazil, neighboring the states of Par\u00e1 and Amazonas. It also borders Venezuela to the north, and Guyana to the east. It is the northernmost and most geographically and logistically isolated state in Brazil, and is Brazil's least populous state.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Boa Vista \u2014 the state capital is a planned city inspired by the streets and avenues of Paris, on the route between Manaus and Venezuela\n2 Bonfim \u2014 a city on the border of Guyana across from Lethem that has ruins of a fort built by the Portuguese in 1775\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Mount Roraima \u2014 the infamously-shaped flat plateau on the border of Venezuela and Guyana\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe history of Roraima is strongly linked to the Branco River, which allowed the first Portuguese settlers to arrive in the region. The Branco River Valley's strategic position made it coveted by the English and the Dutch, who entered Brazil through the Guiana Shield in search of indigenous people to be enslaved. The Spaniards also came to invade the northern part of the Branco River and the Uraricoera River through Venezuela. The Portuguese settlers defeated and expelled all invaders, establishing Portugal's sovereignty over the region of Roraima and part of the Amazonas.\nAs a result of crisis in Venezuela since the 2010s, Roraima has become the leading entry point for Venezuelan refugees in Brazil. Displaced Venezuelans in Roraima are estimated to number around 100,000, approximately one-fifth of the state's population.\n\n\nGet in\nBR-174 connects the state with Amazonas and is the only paved road that connects the state to the rest of Brazil. There are also land border crossings with Guyana at Lethem/Bonfim and with Venezuela at Pacariama.\nThere are flights to Boa Vista from all large Brazilian airports, mostly via Manaus and Bras\u00edlia, and there are flights from regional destinations, and across the border from Suriname and Guyana.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\nNatural attractions are the main tourist attractions in the state, especially Mount Roraima.\nPedra Pintada is the state's most important archaeological site; it contains inscriptions of ancient civilizations, such as cave paintings, pieces of ceramics, hatchets, necklace beads, among other artifacts that indicate the history of human migration, dating back to 4,000 years. \nSerra do Tepequ\u00e9m is a plateau that offers trekking opportunities to the waterfalls of Paiva, Sobral, Barata and Funil.\nLake Caracaran\u00e3 is known for its fine sand beaches surrounded by cashew trees.\n\n\nDo\nAdmire Mount Roraima from a distance. The only way to climb is in Venezuela from Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next\nAngel Falls in Venezuela",
