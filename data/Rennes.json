  "extract": "Rennes is the chief city of Brittany in northwest France. It's mostly modern and industrial, but has many grand 18th and 19th century buildings, and survivors of earlier times. It's also well-endowed with cultural attractions. In 2020 the city population was 222,485, with about 150,000 more living in the wider metropolis. \n\n\nUnderstand\nRennes has long been one of the main towns of Brittany, but until 1806 it was overshadowed by the capital and Atlantic port Nantes. Then under Napoleon I Bonaparte, Nantes lost that role and indeed was removed from Brittany, so Rennes came to the fore. Its small river Vilaine was canalised and made navigable, and connected to other towns, so freight and industry were boosted even before the arrival of the railway. Its higgledy-piggledy medieval streets and half-timbered houses were mostly lost to a great fire in 1720, and replaced by stately stone mansions on a grid pattern, though the area east of the cathedral retains some of its older style. \nThe city was badly damaged in the Second World War: in 1940 German bombing hit an ammunition train parked next to troop and refugee trains, the day before the occupation of the city; and then it was heavily bombed by the Allies in 1943 and 1944. Postwar Rennes developed metal-bashing heavy industries, but as elsewhere in the West these succumbed to Asian competition from the 1970s. There were many strikes, demos and riots. From the 1990s the city regrouped around telecoms and service industries. The university also grew, so modern Rennes has a large student population, which gives it a bit of a buzz. Traditionally the students throng the bars on Thursday nights. \nThe climate is Atlantic: it can rain any day, though not as much as on the coast: see the M\u00e9t\u00e9o forecast.\n1 Destination Rennes is the Tourist Office, at 1 Rue Saint-Malo 50 m north of Metro Sainte-Anne  a  b . It's open M 14:00-18:00, Tu-Sa 10:00-18:00, Su 10:00\u201313:00 & 14:00\u201317:00.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Rennes Bretagne Airport (RNS  IATA), Ave Joseph le Brix, Saint-Jacques-de-la-Lande, \u260f +33 2 99 29 60 00, accueil@rennes.aeroport.fr. This has regular flights from Europe and London, mostly by budget carriers. For the time being, Air France fly 2 or 3 times a day from Paris CDG, but this is going to fall foul of the law banning French domestic flights for journeys that can be done overland in less than 2\u00bd hours. Other domestic flights are from Lyon, Marseille, Nice and Toulouse. The airport has the usual facilities including car rental.   (updated Jun 2023)\nTo town: The airport is 6 km southwest of city centre.\n-  Bus C6 runs daily every 30 min between 05:00 and 00:00. It takes 20 min to Centre Commercial Cesson, with a stop by the art museum on Quai Emil Zola. Bus 57 from the airport was axed.\n- Saint-Jacques de la Lande railway station is 1 km east of the airport. It has trains every few hours on the TER Breizh line between Rennes (5 min) and Messac-Guipry.\n- Taxis wait outside Arrivals. A ride downtown might be \u20ac20.\nNantes Atlantique (NTE IATA) has a similar choice of flights.\nParis Charles de Gaulle (CDG IATA) has global flight connections.\nDinard\u2013Pleurtuit\u2013Saint-Malo (DNR IATA) nowadays only has private aviation.\n\n\nBy train\nFor fare deals see Rail travel in France.\nTrains run hourly from Paris Montparnasse, taking 90 min nonstop to Rennes. They continue to Saint-Brieuc and  Brest, another two hours, as the winding line through Brittany isn't upgraded for TGV speeds. From Paris CDG airport take the RER train into the city and change at Chatelet/Les Halles for Montparnasse - the direct train starting in Lille only runs twice a day. Likewise from the south of France, you usually change across Paris. \nFrom Nantes an hourly regional train takes 80 min nonstop. From St Malo an hourly regional train takes an hour via five stops. From Quimper an hourly train takes two hours via Lorient and Vannes. From Caen a twice-daily train takes 3 hr 20 min via Avranches (for Mont St-Michel). \n2 Gare de Rennes  is clean and modern, with Gares metro and bus station just outside. Walk 1 km north for the historic centre.\n\n\nBy bus\nBlablacar (owned by the rail company SNCF) runs eight times a day from Paris (Bercy-Seine), taking 4-5 hours via Le Mans. In 2023 an adult single is about \u20ac35. There's one direct service daily from Paris CDG Airport. Flixbus have three late-night runs. \nBlablacar services from other French cities are often car-share rides, and may start or drop off some distance from city centres.\nBreizhGo is the regional bus company. It connects over twenty villages and small towns to Rennes: routes a visitor might use are from Saint-Malo, Dinard and Vitr\u00e9.\nRennes bus station is next to the railway station and Metro Gares  a  b .\n\n\nBy road\nFrom Paris follow A10 / A11 west past Chartres to Le Mans then A81 past Laval.\n\n\nGet around\n\nWalking is always first choice in the compact city centre.\n\n\nBy public transport\nStar is the city transport system, with 50 bus lines and two Metro (VAL) lines. The hub for these is the mainline railway and intercity bus station Gares. The principal routes run 05:30 to 00:30. The metro lines run an extra hour longer until almost 02:00 on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings.\nIn 2023 a single ticket is \u20ac1.50, valid for one hour and unlimited transfers. A one day pass is \u20ac4.20, three days is \u20ac11.70 and seven is \u20ac18.35. Longer passes (KorrigoCards) are available from Gares travel centre - you'll need photo ID, which they scan onto the card.\nMetro Line A runs northwest to southeast, from JFK to Villejean University, Sainte-Anne, Gares and out to La Poterie. Line B, opened in 2022, runs northeast to southwest, from Cesson via Sainte-Anne, Gares, and out to Saint-Jacques.\n\n\nBy bike\nRennes has plenty of cycle lanes, and for a pleasant excursion follow the canal.\nLe V\u00e9lo STAR is the rental bike system, part of the public transport system. You register online and pay \u20ac150 deposit, which enables you to pick up a bike from any of the 80-some docking stations. Then you pay \u20ac1 for a trip up to one hour and \u20ac2 for 24 hours; electric bikes cost more. Longer tariffs are available up to 12 months.\n\n\nBy car\nAvoid using a car in city centre: many routes are barred to private vehicles, and parking is scarce and expensive. \nParcs-relais is the Park & Ride system. Eight metro / bus stations have car parks, free to enter and more importantly free to exit by using your transport ticket. These are J.F. Kennedy  a  (not Su), Villejean-Universit\u00e9  a , Cesson-Viasilva  b , Les Gayeulles  b  and Saint-Jacques - Ga\u00eet\u00e9  b  (not Su) in the north, Les Pr\u00e9ales in the east (bus only, not Su), and Henri Fr\u00e9ville  a  (not Su) and La Poterie  a  in the south.\nTaxis wait at Gares. There are over a dozen operators.\n\n\nSee\n\n Mus\u00e9e de Bretagne, 10 Cours des Alli\u00e9s (within Les Champs Libre just north of station), \u260f +33 2 2340 6600.

They decided to demolish it and build afresh in neo-classical style, and this took until 1845. It was renovated from 2009 to 2015.  (updated Jun 2023)\n2 Portes Mordelaise is the last remaining city gate. Rennes acquired city walls and gates in the 3rd century AD, but the present structure is 15th century, when the gate and alley towards the cathedral were the principal entrance to the city. This route led 15 km west to the village of Mordelles, hence the name.\nOld town with half-timbered houses (maisons \u00e0 pans de bois) is best preserved is the little streets just east of the cathedral, such as Rue Saint-Sauveur, Rue Saint-Guillaume, and Rue du Chapitre. Most were lost in the fire of 1720, after which the northern districts were rebuilt in stone on a grid pattern.\nSaint-Sauveur Basilica is in the Old Town 50 m east of the cathedral.

Its highlights are its 17th century paintings, and works of the Pont-Aven school led by Gauguin. Permanent collection free, exhibitions \u20ac4.  (updated Jun 2023)\n4 Parlement de Bretagne is a grand building that since 1804 has housed the regional Court of Appeal - Brittany's parliament was abolished during the Revolution. It was badly damaged by fire during demonstrations in 1994, but restored as before. There are occasional guided tours.\n\n5 Parc du Thabor (Bus 3 from Republique station). A large park in the northeast of the city. It was originally a monastery orchard, confiscated during the Revolution, and laid out as public gardens.

It was an abbey church, and served as the city's \"pro-cathedral\" while Saint-Pierre was rebuilt in the early 19th century. Saint Melaine was the first bishop of Rennes circa 500 AD.\n6 Frac Bretagne, 19 Ave Andr\u00e9 Mussat, \u260f +33 2 9937 3793. Tu-Su 12:00-18:00.
