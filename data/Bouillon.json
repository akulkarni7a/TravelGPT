  "extract": "Bouillon is a small town located on the southern edge of the province of Luxembourg in the Wallonia region in Belgium. The Semois river cut out the beautiful valley in which the town was built. The town is located merely 2 kilometers from the border with France.\n\n\nUnderstand\nIn the past Bouillon functioned as a lordship within the Duchy of Lower Lorraine and the principal seat of the Ardennes-Bouillon dynasty.\n\n1 Tourism Office (Maison du tourisme du Pays de Bouillon), Quai des Saulx 12, \u260f +32 61 465211, info@bouillon-tourisme.be. \n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy public transport\nBouillon does not have a train station. The closest train station is in Libramont. Line #8 of the TEC company has the most frequent connection between the train station of Libramont and the town of Bouillon. It is advised to check the schedule in advance, since the schedule is rather infrequent. \n\n\nBy car\nA private car is the best way to visit the Bouillon area since public transport is sparse here. Bouillon is crossed by the European road E46, which leads to Sedan (in France the road is labeled N58). A crossroads located a few kilometers to the south of the town allows you to take the N83 towards Arlon and Luxembourg. The European route E46 also provides access from Dinant and Namur (via the N95 national road) as well as Libramont and the E411 motorway. Finally, the N810, to the west of the city, leads to the Semois valley.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe historical centre of Bouillon is very small and easily covered on foot, though there may be some steep inclines.\n\n\nSee\n1 Bouillon Castle.   \n2 Ducal Museum, Rue du Petit 1, \u260f +32 61 46 41 89, info@museeducalbouillon.be. \n3 Tombeau du G\u00e9ant Viewpoint, Moulin de Rivage.
