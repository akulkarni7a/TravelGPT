Train travel offers many benefits.\nRome.\n\nAs the primary seaport for Rome, Civitavecchia has trains that frequently take commuters and cruisers into the city.  Commuter trains take about 80\u201390 minutes to reach the main station in Roma...the Termini...and to return from there.  With fairly-early departures, the service makes effective day-trips possible...though rush-hour times find them rather full.\nTickets cost about \u20ac4.5 each way. Or you can purchase round trip B.I.R.G. tickets for roughly twice that.  As of Summer 2009, the latter tickets allowed you unlimited use of Rome city buses and the Metro.\nCruisers are usually provided shuttles from their ship to and from the port pedestrian entrance.  From there, you'll find the train station about a 10-minute walk along the seashore.\nTake care with your belongings...few needed for a day-trip.  Commuter train cars are designed with a platform-level center section for boarding, with seating accessed by narrow stairs that induce many people to leave packages and luggage on the center.  Thieves can grab such items and jump off the train just as the doors close at any en route stop.\nDrinks are allowed on the trains.",
