  "extract": "To save money on a multiple destination trip you may want to look into purchasing Interrail, Eurail or some of the regional passes. \"Interrailing\" has lost its status as a European rite of passage, but it remains a uniquely flexible way to travel \u2013 you can literally arrive at a city, decide you don't like the look of it, and zoom off on the next train out. This makes it a great way to get a feel for a large region, especially when heading out into the countryside. Do not, however, fall into the trap of travelling so continuously that all you see is a blur of railway stations.\nRail passes work just like flexible tickets. After validating the pass, the pass holder is free to board any train that does not require reservations and is within the area/countries specified on the pass.\n\n\nGeneral info\nInterrail passes are exclusively available for residents of Europe and surrounding countries, whereas Eurail passes are exclusively sold to residents of the rest of the world \u2013 for precise information see the Interrail and Eurail sections. \nMost other European passes are available only to travellers who are not residents of the countries covered by the pass.\n\n\nValidity\nIn general, passes are valid on all trains operated by national rail companies; more and more private rail newcomers accept the pass. In some countries (Italy, Spain and Switzerland in particular) you'll find regional or private companies that don't accept Interrail or Eurail passes, although many of them offer up to 50% discount for passholders. \nDepending on the country, the pass may not only cover intercity rail, but also some public transit and ferry services, but mind that not all railway companies or train services may be covered. The complete list of train operators accepting passes can be found at the Interrail or Eurail website.\n\n\nReservations\nExtra fees can apply for making reservations, fast trains, couchettes and sleepers. The exact rules vary by country and can be very complex, so ask in advance, but a rule of thumb is that anything which requires a reservation in advance (shown with a black [R] in a box in schedules) will require a surcharge. In peak season on popular routes seat reservations are definitely worthwhile.\nNight trains. Travelling overnight has gotten more and more costly and less worthwhile for passholders; the fees for couchettes are usually higher or even much higher for passholders. If booked well in advance, a non-refundable discount ticket (including the fee for a berth) might be cheaper than the mere berth fee according to the special tariff applied for passholders. If you particularly feel like passing a night sitting upright and perhaps getting no sleep at all, the \"normal\" seats most sleeper trains also carry might be a good deal, however\n\nHigh-speed trains such as TGV, Thalys, ICE (only lines to France), Eurostar, Italia, Cisalpino, X2000, AVE and Talgo 200, may require pass holders to pay supplements, particularly in Spain, Italy and France, which makes rail passes for these countries rarely worthwhile (see Infobox). The One Country Premium Passes, which included the supplements, were discontinued in 2019.\nEurail and Interrail passes are valid on Eurostar crossings between UK and mainland Europe, but a reservation is compulsory (\u20ac30 fee between the UK and France or Belgium, \u20ac35 for the Netherlands, and \u20ac8 more for 1st class on both routes) and can be made from 12 weeks in advance here; the pass must be valid for travel in the continental departure or arrival country, i.e. for either France (Paris\u2013London route) or Belgium (Brussels\u2013London route).\nYou'll find an introduction to reservations on the Interrail website. Basically, reservation conditions are the same for both Eurail and Interrail, but as the participating countries differ, the corresponding website should be consulted to avoid getting misled \u2013 for detailed information about reservation see the Interrail resp. Eurail section.\nMind: A vacant seat is not guaranteed unless you make a reservation!\n\n\nFerries\nOn both Interrail and Eurail, ferries between Ireland and France, Italy and Greece as well as many ferries in the Baltic sea between Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Finland, are discounted, while a select few are free (albeit still subject to seasonal surcharges and port fees). Many boat rides on Switzerland's lakes are free as well. With a flexible pass and an ambitious itinerary, ferry travel can be a smart choice on the majority of routes where only a discount applies, as only free crossings use up a travel day. Bear in mind though, that on overnight sailings a reclining seat or cabin/berth, which is often an obligatory extra, is sometimes not subject to the same rate of reduction the basic fare is, and can be a significant hidden expense.\nAs of January 2019 the sale of Plus variants of Interrail one-country passes for Greece and Italy (including free ferry crossings between the two countries) has been discontinued. Now, on most lines you get free deck passage if the Eurail/Interrail pass is valid in both Italy and Greece. If the pass is valid in either Italy or Greece, a 30% discount is granted.\nAlso a special Greek Islands Pass is offered by both Eurail and Interrail and is available for 5 or 6 trips within one month. In the 6-trip pass 2 trips between Italy and Greece are included free of charge. Note that some conditions differ between the Interrail and Eurail pass. For details see Eurail Greek Islands Pass resp. the Interrail Greek Islands Pass.\nThe exact conditions vary according to the ferry operator.\nAlways check the daily schedules during the specific week of travel. Some ferries cease operation in the off-season altogether, while others reduce service to one round-trip daily, from several trips a day during peak season.\n\n\nTravel days\nTravel days are generally counted from midnight to midnight.\nAny mention of \"month\" herein does not mean calendar month, but any month-like time span starting on any day of a month. For example, a pass can be valid from January 1st to January 31st (31 days), February 4th to March 3rd (28 resp. 29 days), or June 15th to July 14th (30 days). One-month passes last longer when starting (on any day) within a 31-day calendar month.\nConcerning Eurail/Interrail, the former 7pm rule has been abolished as of 2019. If you take a train before midnight (e.g., 22:37 to 05:21 the next day), only the day of departure must be filled in. For more details see the Eurail/Interrail Good to know section.\n\n\nQuirks and caveats\nUnless otherwise noted, these all apply to all kinds of passes.\n\nBorder train stations are covered by passes outside the countries they are issued for as well. For example, Salzburg and Kufstein in Austria are considered border stations of Germany and therefore are covered by German railpasses. Likewise Passau and Lindau, among other minor border stations in Germany, as well as Buchs SG in Switzerland and Sopron, Szentgotth\u00e1rd in Hungary are considered Austrian border stations.\nSwitching between classes.\nPassengers with 1st-class passes may travel in 2nd-class compartments at any time. Those with 2nd-class passes can pay the difference (usually 50%) between 1st- and 2nd-class point-to-point fares in order to upgrade to 1st class.\nBetter off with regular tickets? Check the actual prices of normal point-to-point tickets. In some cases your journey can be cheaper with them than with a pass. Especially in eastern European countries a pass tends to be bad value for money as the local cost of point-to-point tickets is very low. In Western Europe you may be able to cobble together an itinerary with non-refundable, non-changeable train-specific discount tickets (valid on a certain train only) that works out cheaper than a pass would, but this lacks the flexibility and sense of adventure that makes Interrail unique.\nIn some countries national discount cards may be an alternative, especially when undertaking few trips, in particular in Austria, where they are sold at a very low price to young people under the age of 26 and families as well as to seniors from the age of 63, which facilitate point-to-point tickets at half price.\nAt Trainline's websites \u2013 Trainline.com or Trainline.eu \u2013 a ticket agency which claims to offer best-price tickets from whichever railway company available, you can check out regular fares and those non-refundable non-changeable train-specific discount tickets.\nMany city-to-city connections are listed on the ACPRail website showing travel details and where you also can check out regular fares.\n\n\nEurail / Interrail\n\nInterrail is made available exclusively to residents of Europe, while Eurail is restricted to residents outside of Europe.\nAlmost all features and conditions of Interrail and Eurail, especially types of passes, variety of selectable travel days and prices, have been harmonized as of January 2019, but some differences do remain. For details see the Interrail resp. Eurail section. \n\n\nParticipating countries\nBoth Eurail and Interrail provide a variety of rail passes which cover travel in most countries in Europe, which comprise all European countries with railway services except Albania, Belarus, Kosovo, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine. \nEurail/Interrail passes cover travel in a total of 35 countries:\n\nThe so-called Benelux country group, comprising Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, is always treated and counted as one country; passes are not available for any single country out of this group. \nMind that Northern Ireland is not covered by One Country Passes for Great Britain, but rather is covered by passes being valid in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe actual list of countries participating in Eurail can be checked here and of those participating in Interrail can be checked here, but mind that the lists are not always up-to-date and the mini-states are not mentioned.\nRailway and ferry companies. The list of all participating companies can be found at the Eurail resp. Interrail website.\n\n\nPass types\nThe previous convoluted zone system has been abolished, and there are now only two basic types of passes, which are available for a variety of travel days:\n\nGlobal Pass, which allows travel in all participating European countries (mind the different countries covered by Eurail and Interrail). \nYou can choose between \"flexible\" passes (for non-consecutive days) and \"continuous\" passes (for consecutive days): \n- flexible passes:\n4 days within 1 month (not available at all European train stations)\n5 or 7 days within 1 month\n10 or 15 within 2 months\n- continuous passes:\n15 or 22 days\n1, 2 or 3 months\nOne Country Pass, which covers one or, in some cases, a group of adjoining countries. Not for all participating countries does a one-country pass exist.\nThis pass is available in \"flexible\" variants only: \n3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 days within 1 month.\nThe Global Pass and One Country Pass offer the same train services in the countries covered by the pass chosen, for details check the Eurail site or the Interrail site.\nAll Eurail/Interrail passes are available for 1st or 2nd class, with the exception of Norway: 2nd class only because of the absence of 1st-class train accommodation.\n\n\nPrices\nPricing naturally depends on the exact variation as well as the age category. \n\n\nAge categories\nAdult: full price\nChild: Children between the age of 4 and under 12 travel on a free Child pass if accompanied by an adult. Up to two children aged 4<12 may accompany an adult, for each additional child a Youth pass is required. Children under the age of 4 travel for free and need no pass at all, except if a reservation for a separate seat or berth is requested.\nYouth: for young people between age 12 and 28 (must be under 28 on the first day of use)\nSenior: for seniors 60 years or older. The Senior fare is not compatible with the free Child pass bonus. In order to profit from the bonus, a senior accompanied by children aged 4<12 has to pay the adult fare.\nNote that the Saver category has been abolished and the Senior category extended to Eurail passes.\n\n\nPass prices\nAs of January 2020, the prices in euros for Eurail and Interrail passes are the same. \nPrices are lowest for the youth age-category and highest for adults, while prices for seniors lie almost exactly in the middle between youth and adult prices. All prices indicated below refer to passes valid in 2nd class and are as of Jan. 2020. The surcharge for 1st-class passes is 33%. \n\nGlobal Pass\nPrice examples (2nd class): \n- flexible passes:\nyouth: \u20ac185 (4 days), \u20ac370 (15 days)\nadult: \u20ac246 (4 days), \u20ac493 (15 days)\n- continuous passes:\nyouth: \u20ac332 (15 days), \u20ac389 (22 days), \u20ac503 (1 month)\nadult: \u20ac443 (15 days), \u20ac518 (22 days), \u20ac670 (1 month)\nThe complete Interrail Global Pass price list is provided at oebb.at, for Interrail you also can check prices on the Interrail website, for Eurail Global Pass check prices on the Eurail website.\nOne Country Pass\nPrices vary from country to country depending on the size of the railway network and general price level, there are 7 price categories. \nPrice examples (2nd class): \nlowest category (countries like Croatia, Czech Republic):\n\u20ac51 (3 days, youth), \u20ac114 (8 days youth); \u20ac59 (3 days, adult), \u20ac132 (8 days, adult)\nhigh category (Norway, Spain, Sweden):\n\u20ac148 (3 days, youth), \u20ac243 (8 days, youth); \u20ac170 (3 days, adult), \u20ac281 (8 days, adult).\nhighest category (Germany, Great Britain \u2013 available only with Interrail !!)\n\u20ac166 (3 days, youth), \u20ac257 (8 days, youth); \u20ac192 (3 days, adult), \u20ac297 (8 days, adult).\nThe complete Interrail One Country Pass price list for all countries is provided at oebb.at, for Interrail you also can check prices at Interrail website, for Eurail One Country Passes check prices on the Eurail website.\n\n\nReservations\nAlthough the reservation requirements should be the same, in order to be sure look at the corresponding Eurail or Interrail site. Below you'll find helpful information about reservations on the corresponding website:\n\n\nGood to know\nDetermining the starting date. There is a big difference between Eurail and Interrail passes:\n\nEurail passes are generally valid within 11 months from date of issue, but need to be activated either at a train station or online at the Eurail website. On activation, the first travel day has to be fixed, thus determining the effective period of validity.\nInterrail passes are also valid within 11 months from date of issue, but the first travel day has to be fixed when the pass is ordered. However, this limitation does not apply when buying the pass in the new mobile format.\nPrices usually rise every year to reflect the changes in exchange rate and point-to-point fares. Usually, there are promotion months in March and December, when the prices of most Interrail passes are reduced by 15%; the Eurail homepage advertises even reductions between 15% (One Country Pass) up to 45% (Global Pass). As passes generally can be purchased 11 months in advance, if you got your travel plans fixed it would make sense to buy passes months ahead of the journey.\nTravel days. Usually travel days are counted from midnight to midnight. The former 7pm rule, which counted only the next day when you boarded a direct overnight train or ferry after 7pm, has been abolished as of January 2019 and does not apply anymore. \nThe new regulation determines that the day of departure is counted in any case and you can finish the travel on a direct night train until you'll arrive without using another day. But if you have to change to another train on the next day in order to reach your destination, the next day is counted as one more day.\nFerries. Concerning overnight ferries the regulation is more generous: You can choose whether you want the day of departure or arrival to be counted. And for discounted ferry trips no travel days need to be used, simply showing your pass gets you the discount as long as the pass has not expired \u2013 even if all travel days have been used up.\nExtra benefits. Passholders may obtain extra benefits like discounts on ferry fares or City Cards. Got curious? Here you can check the Eurail benefits and the Interrail benefits.\n\n\nEurail\n\n\nEurail singularities\nEligibility. Eurail passes are intended for foreign visitors to Europe coming from other continents. The passes are similar in scope to Interrail, which is exclusively for people with principal residence in a European country. Find out on the Eurail website whether you are eligible for a Eurail or Interrail pass.\nThe list of Eurail One Country Passes can be checked at eurail.com.\nThe One Country Pass is not available for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro.\nThe One Country Pass France provides a greater choice of selectable days: 1 through 8 days within 1 month!\nEurail Scandinavia Pass: For the four Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden) not only a One Country Pass for each country is available, but in addition a four-country Eurail Scandinavia Pass, valid in all 4 countries, under the conditions of a Eurail One Country Pass.\n\n\nRules of use\nEurail passes must be activated (or validated) by a railway agent or pre-activated at the Eurail website prior to first day of use. Holders of flexible passes (with non-consecutive days) should mark the date in the appropriate box before boarding a train or ship for the first time each day.\nUnlike Interrail, there are no limitations regarding the starting country, and there are no discounts for travel outside the selected countries.\nIn case you need assistance with your Eurail Pass once you're in Europe, you can seek help from at a Eurail Aid Office at major train stations.\nRefund. Eurail passes are 85% refundable if cancelled before being activated, even after pre-activation at the Eurail website if no data have been filled in and the pass has not been used and the pass is returned to Eurail before the starting date of its period of validity.\nPasses purchased at promotional prices are not eligible for refund. For details check here.\nNo refund is possible for unused travel days during or after the period of validity. No refund is available for lost or stolen passes nor for lost or stolen reservation tickets. Customers are offered an optional [pass protection], which allows refund of point-to-point tickets bought within the scope of the pass in case the pass is lost or stolen. In order to find out what to do in such a case, consult the Eurail website.\n\n\nInterrail\n\n\nInterrail singularities\n\nEligibility. Interrail passes are sold to any person who is a resident of Europe, i.e. in the European Union or any of Albania, Andorra, Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gibraltar, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and Vatican City. \nDecisive is not the citizenship, but the principal residence of the applicant, which must be in one of the above-mentioned countries (not travelling on a visa, or military personnel living on a base). Residents of all other countries have to use Eurail passes.\nFind out on the Interrail website whether you are eligible for an Interrail or Eurail pass. \nRestrictions as to the country of residence:\nAn Interrail One Country Pass cannot be purchased for the country of residence. (Many countries do, however, grant a 25\u201350% discount for the trip to the nearest border. The same discount may also apply if travelling from country A to country B through a country outside the pass. But for travelling through several countries, the Global Pass usually is cheaper.)\nThe Interrail Global Pass does not allow travelling freely in the passholder's country of residence, but two free trips in the country of residence are included: from any train station to a border resp. border station or to an airport and return.\nInterrail One Country Pass.\nMind that the One Country Pass is not available for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro.\nThe sale of Plus variant for Greece and Italy (including free ferry crossings between the two countries) has been discontinued as of January 2019. For alternatives see the Ferries section.\nThe Premium variant for the One Country Pass for Italy and Spain has been discontinued as of January 2020.\nThe list of available Interrail One Country Passes can be checked at interrail.eu. \n\n\nRules of use\nThe actual pass is a booklet the size of an airline ticket, each page filled with rows and columns. The front page will state the validity of the ticket (zones and time) and your personal details, which must match the ID you are using (usually a passport). Using it is very easy: whenever you board a train, write down date and time, where you're going from, where you're going to, seat or couchette, and the train number.  When the conductors come to check tickets, show them the pass and they'll (usually) stamp that row.  That's it!  If you manage to run out of pages \u2014 a sign that you're travelling way too much \u2014 you can get extra ones added on at any larger train station.  Your Interrail pass cannot be refunded if lost or stolen, so guard it carefully!\nRefund. An Interrail pass which has not been purchased at a promotional price is eligible for refund when it is unused and returned before the start date printed on the pass. For details consult the Interrail website. \nNo refund is possible for unused travel days during or after the period of validity.\nNo refund is available for lost or stolen passes nor for lost or stolen reservation tickets. Customers are offered an optional pass protection, which allows refund of point-to-point tickets bought within the scope of the pass in case the pass is lost or stolen. In order to find out what to do in such a case, consult the Interrail website.\n\n\nOther cross-national passes\n\n\nEuropean East Pass\nThe European East Pass permits unlimited travelling on all trains of the national railway companies of Austria, Hungary Czech Republic, and Slovakia, on 5 up to 10 days. It is available only to non-residents of these countries. Details can be found here.\n\n\nCentral European Triangle Pass\nThe Central European Triangle Pass is not a typical pass, but a special combined ticket for hopping between the cities of Vienna, Prague and Budapest or Vienna, Prague and Salzburg. This ticket is available for 2nd class only and can be purchased only by non-residents of the four countries. \nThe ticket is valid for one month. Travel can start in any city, going to the others in any order. All trains of the national companies (\u010cD, M\u00c1V, \u00d6BB) can be used in the 2nd class without supplement. Reservations are not included, which are recommended for some trains, especially those between Vienna and Budapest. But mind that you may get on and off the trains only in these cities, no interruption is allowed at intermediate stops. More information can be found here.\n\n\nBalkan Flexipass\nAlthough the slow and infrequent trains are by no means the most efficient way of traveling in the Balkans (this is by any standard the bus), it is one of the more comfortable and scenic.\nThe Balkan Flexipass allows unlimited rail travel for 3, 5, 7, 10 or 15 days of rail travel within 2 months in Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Republika Srpska (Serbian entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina) as well as Turkey (including the Asian part). The pass is available for 1st or 2nd class. For more information see the Rail Europe, ACPRail and Rail.cc websites, where also ordering is possible.\nCaveat is that trains in the Balkans are already really cheap and that it only pays off for longer distances. Another thing to take into account is that the rail network in the Balkans is a lot less dense than in the rest of Europe, so some places simply cannot be gotten to by rail.\n\n\nNational passes\nSeveral national rail companies offer their own one-country pass. Some passes are only available as special offers and tied to a specific season or age group. The following list does not claim to be exhaustive.\nThe sale of the France Rail Pass has been discontinued as of January 2019.\n\n\nCzech Republic\n\u010cD (\u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy), the national Czech railway operator, offer an All-Day Ticket, a one-day pass, valid on one day for all \u010cD trains of any category running on the network. The All-Day Ticket is available for any one region or for the whole country. The price of the All-Day Ticket valid in the whole country is CZK 699 (\u20ac29,40; as of March 2023). \nThe All-Day Ticket is sold to anybody independently of residence.\n\n\nGermany\nGerman Rail Pass for travelling in the whole country on 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 or 15 consecutive or flexible days within 1 month. The pass is available for 1st and 2nd class. \nDiscounts are granted to groups of 2 travellers (\u201eTwin\u201c category) and youth 12<28.  Up to 2 children 6<12 per adult travel on a free Child pass; additional children or those travelling alone require a youth pass; children under 6 years of age travel for free if no reservations are needed.\nThe German Rail Pass is not made available to residents of any European country, Turkey and Russia.\nFor those planning to stay and travel long-distance within Germany for longer periods, Deutsche Bahn (DB) also offers an annual Bahn 100 card.  It costs \u20ac4,339 (standard class) and \u20ac7,356 (first class) for up to a year of unlimited rail travel (including on high-speed ICE trains) without the need for reservation.  In addition, you may use local public transport to or from any railway station on the DB Network.   However for journeys between Germany and an international point, the Bahn 100 card might not cover the segments outside Germany; they will instead be covered by standard tariffs of the country in question.  \n\n\nGreat Britain\n\nBritRail Passes:\nMost passes are available as mobile-phone pass (M-Pass), there are some regional variants available as M-Passes only:\n\nBritRail Pass (covering all of Great Britain), BritRail England Pass, BritRail London Plus Pass', BritRail South West Pass, BritRail Spirit of Scotland Pass (covering all of Scotland), BritRail Central Scotland Pass, BritRail Scottish Highlands Pass.\nNorthern England: North of England Rover Pass, North of England City Experience Pass\nScotland variants: ScotRail Spirit of Scotland M-Pass, ScotRail Central Scotland Rover M-Pass, ScotRail Scottish Grand Tour M-Pass, ScotRail Highland Rover M-Pass, ScotRail Edinburgh Days Out M-Pass, ScotRail Glasgow Days Out M-Pass\nIf you click on any pass in the list above you'll obtain all detailed information concerning that pass.\nThe maps which show where the different BritRail passes are valid can be found here and here.  \nMind that Northern Ireland is not covered by any of the BritRail passes! For travelling in Northern Ireland you have to use an Interrail/Eurail pass valid in Ireland which covers the networks of the Republic of Ireland as well as of Northern Ireland.\nThe BritRail passes are available for consecutive and non-consecutive days. The number of selectable days varies depending on the network and may be different for Europeans and non-Europeans. Most passes do not allow travelling before 9:00am.\nAll passes are available for 1st and 2nd class. The prices of the 1st-class passes have been adjusted to the fact that some trains do not have 1st-class accommodations.\nDiscounts are usually granted to groups of 3-9 people (up to 20%), youth 16<26 (20%), seniors \u2265 60 (up to 15%); one child 5<16 per adult or senior travels on a free Child pass, for each additional child the half adult fare has to be paid; children under 5 years of age travel for free if no reservations are needed. \nFor most passes low-season discounts (up to 20%) are offered for travel between January 1st and February 28th as well as November 1st and December 31st.\nThe official website of BritRail is Britrail.com managed by National Rail, and more detailed information is provided by the authorized retailers where the passes can be ordered. The passes are available at agencies only abroad, and generally online or as mobile-phone app (M-Pass).\nEligibility. The information about who is eligible to BritRail passes is confusing. While Britrail.com says that all passes are exclusively sold to non-UK residents, BritRail.net affirms that North of England Passes and ScotRail Passes are available to anyone including UK residents, as is explicitly mentioned.\n\n\nItaly\nThe Trenitalia Pass is available to Non-Italian citizens residing outside Italy. The pass does not allow unlimited trips on the days on which it is valid. Instead, the pass can be used only for the number of trips chosen at purchase. \nWith this pass you can travel on the \"Frecce\" high-speed trains and on the FrecciaLink service (providing connections) as well as on Intercity, Intercity Night and EuroCity Italy\u2013Switzerland trains (on domestic routes within Italy), all being operated by the Trenitalia railway company. By other railway companies the pass is not accepted. Even regional and local trains operated by Trenitalia cannot be used with this pass.\nIn contrast to Eurail/Interrail passes, the Trenitalia Pass does include seat reservation fees. Nevertheless, reservations are mandatory, but free of charge.\nThe pass is available for\n\n3 or 4 trips within 7 days\n7 trips within 15 days\n10 trips within 1 month\nand also for three classes \n - Easy, Comfort and Executive where Easy permits access to 2nd class only.\nMind that a trip is defined as a ride on one single train without changing. Changing to another train (except to FrecceLink) reduces the number of remaining trips. Thus, the journey has to be planned meticulously in order to make best of use the \"trips\".\nPrices are differentiated between the same age groups as with Eurail/Interrail. Also, the regulations concerning accompanying children are the same.\nAll prices and the conditions of use can be found on the Trenitalia website.\n\n\nSpain\nRenfe Spain Pass is an untypical pass permitting travel on Renfe's long-distance (AVE) and medium-distance trains on 4, 6, 8 or 10 trips (not days!) within 1 month. It is available for 1st class (\"preferente\") or 2nd class (\"turista\"). A trip is defined as a ride on one single train without changing, for each train a reservation is required which can be obtained only at train stations (no extra fee, included in the pass). The \"generosity\" they offer is to permit using commuter trains for free within the time span of 3 hours before getting on and 3 hours after getting off the long-distance train chosen by you. The terms of use are highly insufficiently explained on Renfe's website, but get clearer here. \nThe Renfe Spain Pass is not made available to residents of Spain.\n\n\nSwitzerland\nSwiss Travel Pass\nfor travelling in the whole country on 3, 4, 8 or 15 consecutive or flexible days within 1 month. The Swiss Travel Pass also covers premium panorama trains (except for reservation fees) and most of regional and local public transportation (including buses, trams and boats) and offers discount on privately operated cable cars and funiculars. Free admission to over 500 museums is included as well.\nThe pass is available for 1st and 2nd class. A discount is granted to young people under 26 years of age. The Swiss Travel Pass is not made available to residents of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. \nAn overview on passes and discount cards for tourists is given here. There are also day-passes and week-passes available for certain regions of Switzerland including not only train services, but also regional and local public transport within the region.\n\n\nBuy\nThe quickest way to purchase a Eurail or Interrail pass is via their respective websites (see below).  You will also need to download the Rail Planner app on your phone as most passes are issued in the form of mobile tickets.  Upon purchase, you will receive an email with an alphanumeric code which will serve as your pass number to be entered on the Rail Planner app (to retrieve your mobile ticket) and when you purchase reservations for specific journeys. Eurail passes can be purchased in travel agencies outside Europe as well as at ticket desks of some European railway companies, and usually also at the Eurail Aid Offices, for example in Austria where the Eurail Aid Offices are situated in the First-Class Club Lounges of three major train stations. But be warned that railway companies may have a reduced variety of passes only. \nInterrail passes can be purchased at ticket desks at train stations of major cities.\nThe advantage of buying a pass at a train station is that you don't have to pay shipping costs and obtain the pass immediately. \nNote that Eurail/Interrail Global Passes with a validity of 3 days are not sold at train stations and agencies in Europe, but only at agencies outside Europe and online.\nOfficial Eurail and Interrail ticket shops\n\neurail.com\ninterrail.eu\nEurail, Interrail and other European passes may be obtained on a variety of online ticket shops, where also regular tickets can be ordered. (But be cautious: Not all information on passes might be up-to-date.)\n\nACPRail\nRail Europe\nRail.cc\nFor regular-fare and discounted point-to-point tickets you can check here and also buy tickets:\n\nDeutsche Bahn (DB): International ticket shop\n\n\nQuick links\n\n\nSee also\nRail travel in Europe\nRail travel in Germany\nRail travel in Great Britain\nRail travel in Ireland\nRail and bus travel in Sweden\nRail travel in Switzerland\nFerries in the Mediterranean\nFerry routes to Great Britain\nFerries in the Baltic\nIntercity buses in Germany",
