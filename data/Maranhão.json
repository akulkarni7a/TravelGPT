This is especially noticeable in the unique reggae played here. Maranh\u00e3o is one of the poorest states of Brazil. The predominant indigenous groups are from the Macro-J\u00ea and Macro-Tupi language groups.\n\n\nHistory\nThe first European settlement was made by a French trading expedition under Jacques Riffault of Dieppe, in 1594, who lost two of his three vessels in the vicinity of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Island, and left a part of his men on that island when he returned home. Daniel de La Touche, Seigneur de La Rividi\u00e8re was sent to report on the place, and was then commissioned by the French crown to found a colony on the island; this was done in 1612. The French were expelled by the Portuguese in 1615, and the Dutch held the island from 1641 to 1644. Very successful Indian missions were soon begun by the Jesuits.\nIn the late 18th century, there was a great influx of enslaved peoples into the region, which corresponded to the increased cultivation of cotton. According to the historian Sven Beckert, the region's cotton exports \"doubled between 1770 and 1780, nearly doubled again by 1790, and nearly tripled once more by 1800.\"\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is hot, and the year is divided into a wet season and a dry season. Extreme humidity characterizes the wet season. The heat, however, is greatly modified on the coast by the south-east trade winds.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nMarechal Cunha Machado International Airport is 13 km from the center of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. \nRenato Moreira Airport is a national airport in Imperatriz. \n\n\nGet around\nHighways BR-010 and BR-230 cross the state.\n\n\nSee\nThe dunes of Len\u00e7\u00f3is Maranhenses National Park are an important area of environmental preservation.\nThe state capital, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, is designated a Unesco World Heritage Site. \nThe historic center of Alc\u00e2ntara is also worth a visit.\nThe Parna\u00edba River delta, between the states of Maranh\u00e3o and Piau\u00ed, is an important conservation area, with its lagoons, desert dunes and deserted beaches or islands, such as Ilha do Caju, which shelters rare birds.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\nThe state has 640 km of coastline, which supplies products widely used in regional cuisine, such as shrimp, crab and sururu. \n\n\nDrink\nGuarana Jesus - A soda that tastes like bubble gum.\n\n\nStay safe\nMaranh\u00e3o is considered an endemic area for sylvatic yellow fever. The traveler guidance service of the Brazilian health agency (ag\u00eancia de vigil\u00e2ncia sanit\u00e1ria brasileira) recommends vaccination against the disease at least 10 days before visiting the state. The vaccine can be taken at health centers and at several airports, and immunization is valid for 10 years.\n\n\nGo next",
