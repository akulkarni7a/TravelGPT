  "extract": "Montenegro (Montenegrin: Crna Gora, \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430) is a country in the Balkans, on the Adriatic Sea.\nIt is one of Europe's most recently independent countries, having gained its independence in 2006. Infrastructure greatly improved since independence as Montenegro became home to numerous five-star hotels, glamorous new settlements and investments in roads, energy, water and sanitary pipelines.\n\n\nRegions\nMontenegro is divided into 21 municipalities, which can be grouped into five regions:\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Podgorica \u2014 the capital, and administrative centre as well as the biggest city in Montenegro, intensively developed since independence\n2 Bar \u2014 the major port of the country\n3 Budva \u2014 this fortified old town surrounded by high-rises, resorts and new developments is the most popular tourist spot with amazing beaches and wild nightlife\n4 Cetinje \u2014 the old royal capital beneath Lov\u0107en mountain and its national park features numerous museums, monasteries and former embassies.\n5 Kotor \u2014 an ancient fortified town deep down the Boka Kotorska bay, UNESCO World Heritage Site.

It was founded as a state under its present name in the 15th century, continuing the tradition of the Slavic state of Duklja. It was able to maintain its independence during the reign of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, as its independence was recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In World War I, it fought on the side of the Allied powers. It became part the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. Montenegro was part of various incarnations of Yugoslavia, until it regained its independence from the federation of Serbia-Montenegro after the May 2006 referendum. Montenegro was the only republic of the former Yugoslavia that supported Serbia during the wars of the 1990s.\n\n\nPeople\nMontenegro is home to 620,000 people (2020), and is a multicultural and multiethnic country. All citizens of Montenegro can be called Montenegrin, but this term is also used for a specific ethnicity within the country. The majority of people (~75 %) in the country are ethnic Montenegrins or Serbs, however the exact breakdown of these groups is difficult to determine due to their individual perspectives on how they see their identity. Most ethnic Montenegrins and Serbs are Serbian Orthodox Christians. In the northeast, there is a Bosniak majority, and an Albanian minority, most of whom are followers of Islam. In the town of Ulcinj, there is an Albanian majority, of varying religious persuasions. In the Kotor area, there is a Croat minority, many of whom are Roman Catholic. Regardless of their ethnicity, Montenegrin citizens are known for their kindness and hospitality.\n\n\nClimate\nMontenegro's lower areas along the coast enjoy a Mediterranean climate, having dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Central and northern regions have Continental climate, where temperature varies greatly with elevation. Podgorica, lying near sea level in the valley of the central region, is noted for having the warmest July temperatures in Montenegro, averaging 35-40\u00b0C (95-104\u00b0F).\nCetinje, in the Karst at an elevation of 670 m (2,200 ft), has a temperature 5\u00b0C (10\u00b0F) lower. January temperatures range from 8\u00b0C (46\u00b0F) from Bar on the southern coast to -3\u00b0C (27\u00b0F) in the northern region.\nMontenegro's mountainous regions receive some of the highest amounts of rainfall in Europe. In the northern mountains, snow is present throughout the spring.\n\n\nTerrain\nThe terrain of Montenegro ranges from high mountains through a segment of the Karst of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only one to four miles wide. The coastal plain disappears completely in the north, where Mount Lov\u0107en and other ranges plunge abruptly into the inlet of the Gulf of Kotor.\nMontenegro's section of the Karst lies generally at elevations of just below 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level-although some areas rise to 1,800 m (5,900 ft). The lowest segment is in the valley of the Zeta River, which flows at an elevation of 460 m (1,510 ft).\nThe high mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe. They average more than 2,100 m (6,900 ft) in elevation.\n\n\nVisitor information\nNational Tourism Organisation of Montenegro\n\n\nGet in\nMost foreign tourists enter Montenegro directly by air, by road from Croatia, or occasionally by sea from Italy. Land routes from Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania are mainly used by tourists from those respective countries.\n\n\nEntry requirements\nHolders of travel documents containing a valid Schengen visa, a valid visa of the United States of America or a permission to stay in these countries may enter and stay, i.e. pass through the territory of Montenegro up to seven days, and not longer than the expiry of visa if the period of validity of visa is less than seven days. However, border guards are not fully aware of this information, and they might tell you that you require a visa to enter Montenegro. Stay calm and politely ask them to recheck their information. They will fill a form with your passport and car registration information which can take up to 1 hour!\nAs of 2010, nationals of the following states may enter, pass through the territory of and stay in Montenegro up to 90 days with a valid travel document without a visa: Andorra, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, Greece, Holy See, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Nicaragua, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, El Salvador, San Marino, Seychelles, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uruguay, United States of America and Venezuela.\nThe exemption from the visa requirement also applies to the holders of valid travel documents issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nPodgorica Airport (TGD IATA) \u2013 Montenegro's main international airport with many international and budget flight.\nTivat Airport (TIV IATA) \u2013 This airport has regular flights from Belgrade throughout the year, and has charter flights from major European destinations during the summer.\nDubrovnik Airport (DBV IATA) \u2013 Across the border half-hour drive from the coastal city of Herceg-Novi to Croatia. This airport is served by many major airlines, so it is a good option for tourists coming by plane.\nOther nearby airports are in Sarajevo (SJJ IATA), Pristina (PRN IATA) and Tirana (TIA IATA).\n\n\nBy train\nThere are one daytime and one overnight train (two in summer) from Belgrade. Trains go through Bijelo Polje, Kola\u0161in, Podgorica and ends in Bar, Montenegro's main seaport. The railway through the Dinaric Mountains is considered as one of the most scenic railways in Europe. Travel by train is the cheapest way to get to Montenegro, but the quality of service is not very good. Trip time is 10 hr from Belgrade to Podgorica (11 hr to Bar), but expect considerable delays.\nThe train Lovcen 433 will leave at\t20:20 with the scheduled arrival to Bar, the last station, at 07:23.\nIn December 2022 they charge \u20ac21.00 for the six berth compartment, and \u20ac31.80 the four berth one. Payable in local currency or bank card at Belgrade Center Station\n\n\nBy bus\nMontenegro is well connected with neighbouring countries and ticket prices are all under \u20ac25. During the summer, more seasonal lines are being introduced.\n\n\nBy car\nEuropean routes E65, E80, E762, E763 and E851 pass through the country, connecting it to Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Albania.\nThere are no roads in Montenegro built to motorway standard, however a Bar-Belgrade motorway should be completed by 2032.\nDriving with headlights is obligatory, even during the daytime; so is the use of seat belts.\n\n\nBy boat\nThere is a regular ferry line from Bar to Bari in Italy. The Bar-Bari line operates throughout the year, with service several times weekly during the summer. A trip to Bari takes around 8 hours. There is also ferry service from Bari, Italy, to Dubrovnik in Croatia.  From there, bus service is available to Montenegro - the Dubrovnik bus station is adjacent to the port where the ferry docks.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\nThis may be the quickest way to get around Montenegro. Buses are frequent (especially during the summer), safe and are more or less on schedule. Ticket prices within Montenegro are all under \u20ac15. Examples of prices: Podgorica-Ulcinj \u20ac6, Podgorica-Cetinje \u20ac3, Cetinje-Kotor \u20ac5. Local buses usually have no airconditioning. There are normal buses and minibuses, depending on the destination.\nAll bus stations demand a fee for using the bus station, which is included in you ticket when you buy it at the bus station. However, it apparently is not included in online tickets, and there often erupt discussions between the station conductor and tourists since they are not let onto the platform without paying this fee. You can always pay the fee at the station when having bought your ticket online, but do so sufficiently ahead of the departure or you might miss your bus. The conductor will stand his ground. To get around the station fee, just go to any of the nearby bus stops of the route\u2014bus drivers will happily take any additional passengers. But be sure to know the fare. You can find the bus stops on OpenStreetMap, e.g. with mobile apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz. \nUse Busticket4Me to find out the schedules and prices within Montenegro and even to destinations outside.\nMost bus stations have WiFi\u2014sometimes you have to ask for the password.\n\n\nBy train\n\nGoing by train is a great alternative to using the bus, but coverage of the country is not great.\nFrom Podgorica there are regular train services to Bar, Bijelo Polje (and further to Belgrade) through Kola\u0161in and Mojkovac, and Nik\u0161i\u0107. It is the cheapest way to travel from north to south and vice versa, costing \u20ac2.80 at most within Montenegro. The quality of service is not on the high level, but decent.\nFind timetables and prices on the official Montenegro Railway Website.\nFurthermore, Montenegro Railways has reactivated the train route to Nik\u0161i\u0107, providing a scenic and pretty cheap journey, without being slower than the bus, and the chance to jump of at the Ostrog Monastery.\n\n\nBy car\n\nMost roads are two-lane only, with frequent addition of a third overtaking lane, and generally are not up to European standards. Most roads are curvy and mountainous, so speeds over 80 km/h (50 mph) are rarely legal or safe.\nThe speed limit is usually 80 km/h on the open road and 50 km/h (31 mph) in built-up areas.\nThe use of safety belts and headlights during the day is compulsory, and the use of cellphones while driving is prohibited. Signposts used in Montenegro are almost identical to those used in EU countries.\nLocal drivers tend to drive fast, and to get involved into dangerous manoeuvres. Traffic jams are common during the peak of the summer season. Pedestrians are notorious for jaywalking in every Montenegrin city.\nDrivers tend to be extremely vocal, so don't take it personally if a driver yells at you.\nYou can rent a car in Montenegro from \u20ac11 in Tivat Airport, from \u20ac14 in Podgorica Airport, and travel around cities and across the country.\n\n\nSpecific roads\nRoads from Podgorica to Bar and to Niksic are fairly good and easy to drive on.\nThe roads from Podgorica through Cetinje to Budva and to Petrovac are both in good condition, but are curvy mountainous roads which rarely permit speeds over 70 km/h.\nThe road from Podgorica north to Kolasin, and then on to Zabljak or Serbia, is considered dangerous during the winter, especially the part through the Moraca canyon. It is recommended that you take the bus to the north during the cold or rainy days, as bus drivers are experienced and know the road.\nThe old road from Cetinje to Kotor is mostly a narrow one-lane road offering stunning views of Kotor from above, but exercise extreme caution when passing on-coming traffic, over-taking and around corners.\n\n\nBy rental car\nRent-a-car businesses are numerous and prices start from \u20ac20 per day for Toyota Yaris.\n\n\nBy thumb\nHitchhiking works pretty well in Montenegro, although the general warnings apply. Even though locals also generally take people, it is more likely to get picked up by other tourists, especially along the coast and during high season. Also, see Hitchwiki for more details.\n\n\nBy helicopter\nA unique opportunity to discover the wild beauty of Montenegro is also by helicopter. Transportation could be organised from Dubrovnik, Kotor, Budva, Podgorica. Well-established operators are specialized in scenic flights, charters and commercial transfers across the region.\n\n\nOn foot and navigation\nMontenegro is a popular hiking destination with many picturesque trails and summits. Make sure to have good (offline) maps and GPS with you. For reliable maps, GPS navigation, comprehensive trails and map information, consult OpenStreetMap, which is also used by this travel guide and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz. Or just download the according GPX or KML files for such trails on OpenStreetMap through Waymarked Trails. (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID to download the GPX or KML files through the same link.)\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Montenegrin phrasebook\nThe official language is Montenegrin. It is essentially the same language as Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian. In some municipalities with an Albanian majority (Ulcinj) or large minority (Plav, Gusinje) and the Malesia district in Podgorica municipality, Albanian is commonly spoken. Slovenian and Macedonian are also understood. Even though their languages are virtually identical, people still distinguish between the Montenegrin, Serb, Croat and Bosniak ethnicities, Montenegrins forming a slight majority. Montenegrin is found written in both Cyrillic and Latin forms. Latin text is much more common in Montenegro than in neighboring Serbia and the Serbian portion of Bosnia.\nIn Podgorica and the coastal area, many people can speak some English. People sometimes have a working knowledge of German, as there is a sizeable diaspora community in both Germany and Austria. Italian also comes in very handy, especially along the coast. Russian, which also belongs to the same family of Slavic languages, is spoken by many older people as it was a compulsory second language in Yugoslavia, though it has largely been supplanted by English among the younger generation. Russian speakers will, however, find themselves catered for by the tourist industry along the coast.\n\n\nSee\nWhile Montenegro may be a small country, it has so much diverse history and nature to see. There are stunning mountainous landscapes, dramatic coastlines, historic monuments and truly beautiful walled towns. The Montenegro coast is just as gorgeous as that of its better known neighbour, Croatia, and it is for good reason that its main tourist destinations get crowded in summer. Nevertheless, if you can't visit at another time, don't let their popularity hold you back. Even the largest of cruise ship crowds will not stop you from enjoying this country's magnificent Riviera and Medieval coast towns, especially if you're willing to get up early and do your sightseeing ahead of the others.\nOf the country's many churches and monasteries, the Serbian Orthodox Ostrog Monastery deserves special attention. It's spectacularly located against a practically vertical background, some 10 km from Danilovgrad. Founded in the 17th century, it's one of the most visited pilgrimage destinations on the Balkans and boasts a magnificent view over the Bjelopavli\u0107i plain.\n\n\nThe Riviera\n\nThe Bay of Kotor, is probably one of the prettiest bays in the world. On its deepest point lies the equally stunning town of Kotor, a beautifully preserved fortified, Medieval town with a vibrant history. Wandering through its labyrinth of narrow and cobblestoned streets, you'll come across lively piazzas, many ancient churches and lots of pleasant bars and restaurants. Don't miss the 12th-century St. Tryphon Cathedral, the Church of St. Luke and the Orthodox St Nicholas Church. Kotor is locked between the blue sea on one side, and a dramatically steep cliff on the other. It's a heavy walk uphill, but climbing the 1500 steps will allow you to see the old fortifications on the top and provide some amazing views over the bay.\nBudva is the country's most popular tourist destination, and boasts some great beaches and a lovely, walled town centre. The old town centre is picturesquely located on a rather small peninsula, and its narrow, winding lanes hide a multitude of historic buildings, churches and small squares. Among the most interesting monuments here are the 7th-century St. John's Church, the 8th-century Santa Marija of Punta and the 12th-century Church of St. Sava. The medieval town fortress is referred to as Citadela and right next to it is the colourful Church of the Holy Trinity, built in 1804. Budva's Riviera is over 30 km long, and has been called \"The Riviera of Sandy Beaches\". It is dotted with lovely hamlets and a wealth of historic monuments. A strip of hotels and restaurants separates it from the impressive mountain massifs of Lovcen. From Budva, it's an easy bus ride to the unique Sveti Stefan resort.\n\nThe small but gorgeous town of Perast saw some of its best architecture arise in the 17th and 18th century, when it belonged to the Republic of Venice. That typically Venetian, baroque architecture has been wonderfully preserved, with highlights including the Bujovic, Zmajevic, Badovic and Smekja Palaces which were once owned by wealthy maritime captains. All the way in the south, Ulcinj is one of the Adriatic's oldest towns, with a delightful centre and lots of natural beauty around. It also makes a good base from where to explore the old centre of nearby Bar, Lake Skadar or even a cross border visit to Albania. Although less spectacular than nearby Kotor, Herceg Novi (roughly translated as New Castle) is another charming Montenegrin town with a beautiful old centre and a good number of interesting churches, squares and fortresses.\n\n\nNatural attractions\n\nAlthough Montenegro's magnificent seaside scenery is best known among travellers, its mountainous inland has some grand panoramic views to offer, too. The country shares the large freshwater Lake Skadar with neighbouring Albania. It has National Park status and offers great opportunities for hiking, bird watching and wildlife spotting. Of the many friendly fishermen's towns around it, Virpazar is the most convenient one for travellers. A real must-see is the splendid Tara River Canyon, with its steep banks rising up to 1300 metres above the River Tara waters. It's the second longest canyon in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The canyon is in Durmitor National Park, which is a World Heritage Site of its own and boasts a rich flora and fauna as well as snow-covered high peaks, several canyons and many glacier lakes. The most visited one is Black Lake, at walking distance of the town of \u017dabljak, which serves as a traveller's hub for mountain and winter tourism.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nFestivals\nMontenegro has a lot of local festivals that are worth going to and may range from typical music concerts to local festivities involving free food and drinks. Usually wine and seafood.\n\nBoke\u0161ka No\u0107 (3rd week of August) - Celebrations under masks by the iconic fortifications of Kotor where each year a hateful figure is burned, and celebrations out in the open continues till early morning.\nSea Dance Festival (end of July) - infamous Exit festival has found a new home for summer season and the biggest music happening in SE Europe is hosted on Jaz beach in Budva.\nDays of Wine and Fish in Virpazar - worth experiencing. Gathering of wine and fish lovers in a scenic local village on the Skadar Lake. Very crowded, and smokey from fish frying.\nPetrova\u010dka no\u0107 (Petrovac) - celebrating the local traditions it is great time to visit the city and enjoy the crowd, food and music.\nSpring Break - typical music festival with plenty of DJs on Kamenovo beach\nBlueberry Days - in Plav in northern Montenegro, this festival is attributed to blueberries which are famous is important gathering of Montenegrin diaspora and its relatives as well as many tourists.\nPasticada Fest\nSun\u010dane Skale\nDani Mimoze\nSouthern Soul Festival\n\n\nOutdoor activities\n Rafting. Rafting on archaic wooden or rubber boats down the 100-km path of largest canyon in Europe is one-of-a-kind experience. (updated Jan 2017)\n Hiking/Trekking/Biking. Considering the size and very late development of infrastructure Montenegro has relied on various pathways interconnecting villages, roads, churches and mountains which is nowadays maintained and ideal for all outdoor activities. Maps of routs may be obtained by tourist offices located in towns. \n Cruise and dive in the Bay of Kotor. Iconic scenery of Boka Kotorska may be only appreciated fully from the sea-level and various small islands with tremendous history can only be reached that way. Diving may be interesting on several spots along Lustica. \n Paragliding over Budva Riviera. Scenery of Boka Bay may be only appreciated fully from the sea-level and various small islands with tremendous history can only be reached that way. Diving may be interesting on several spots along Lustica. \n Kite-surfing on the Ada Bojana. Experience winds on southern-most tip of Montenegros 12-km long sandy beach near Ulcinj \n (summer) Skiing/Snowboarding. While during winter downhill skiing and snowboarding is usual activities within resorts in \u017dabljak and Kola\u0161in throughout summer on many mountains specific regions remain under snow and are ideal for wild summer skiing or snowboarding experience \n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nMontenegro uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\n\n\nATMs\nHundreds of ATMs are available in major cities. The ATMs accept most international Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards.\nIf you are from the Balkans, Central or Eastern Europe, look for an ATM of your bank. It is quite possible that the bank operates in Montenegro and that there will be no fees.\nGenerally, ATMs will add an extra fee to your withdrawal, which is invoiced as one amount together with the amount dispensed. In the following the fees as of July 2024:\n\nErste Bank: \u20ac5\nNLB: \u20ac5\nckbbanka: \u20ac5\n\n\nCredit cards\nAlthough they are accepted in supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and many shops, always keep some cash with you for open-air markets, souvenir stalls, small bakeries, museums and public transport.\n\n\nExchange offices\nNot very common, since nearly all tourists bring euros with them. In case you happen to arrive in Montenegro without any euros in cash, use an ATM (recommended) or find a bank to change US dollars, Swiss francs or British pounds.\n\n\nShopping\n\n\nBusiness hours\nRegular businesses and governmental agencies work from 08:00-09:00 to 16:00-17:00, while convenience stores, pharmacies and shops usually work until 20:00-21:00. Bars, pubs and restaurants usually work until midnight or 01:00 while clubs may run until 03:00 or 04:00.\n\n\nLocal specialities\nCheese\nSmoked ham\nTraditional clothes\nSouvenirs\n\n\nCity stores\n\nCity centre and Bulevar D\u017eord\u017ea Va\u0161ingtona in Podgorica\nPorto Montenegro\nmany shops in Old Towns of Kotor and Budva\n\n\nShopping malls\nDelta City in Podgorica\nTQ Centre in Budva\nKamelija in Kotor\n\n\nConvenience shops & supermarkets\nVoli markets, HD Lakovi\u0107, Maxi Markets and Roda are main retail supermarket chains and are found in almost all cities. There are also other convenience stores that stuff various goods. The prices of basic local food (baked goods, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables) are on the level of Bosnia and Serbia, i.e. generally cheaper than EU countries.\n\n\nEat\n\nApart from the hotels located in towns and summer resorts offering half-board and full-board accommodation, and those along the roads and communication lines such as restaurants, pizza places, taverns, fast food restaurants and cafes, there is a choice of national restaurants offering traditional Montenegrin cuisine.\nIn addition to the standard European and Mediterranean cuisine, Montenegro offers a variety of healthy food products and local specialities.\nCold hors-d'oeuvres include the famous njegu\u0161ki pr\u0161ut (smoked ham) and njegu\u0161ki cheese, pljevaljski cheese, mushrooms, donuts and dried bleak. The main courses specific for the northern mountainous region are boiled lamb, lamb cooked in milk, cicvara in fresh milk cream (buttered corn porridge), boiled potatoes with cheese and fresh cream. A selection of traditional recipes of the central and coastal parts will include the kastradina (dried mutton), smoked and fresh carp (from Skadar lake) and a variety of fresh sea fish and seafood dishes. Donuts served with honey and dried figs are traditional desserts in these parts of Montenegro.\nProducts of animal origin are supervised and approved by veterinary and health authorities according to EU standards. The restaurant scene in Montenegro is rapidly evolving and has become increasingly international and continues to attract a new diverse variety of restaurants on the coast and in Podgorica.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nWine\nMontenegrin vineyards and the production of quality wine is part of the tradition of southern and coastal wine makers.\nThe best known Montenegrin wines are the premium whites: \"Krsta\u010d\", \"Cabernet\", \"Chardonnay\" and reds: \"Vranac\", \"Pro Corde\". All of them are produced by the famous company \"Planta\u017ee\", but there's also some home-made wines of high quality, like Crmni\u010dko wine.\n1L bottle of \"Vranac\" red wine will cost you from \u20ac8 to \u20ac15 in the bar or restaurant and it is well worth it! Also, you can buy a bottle of \"Plantaze\"'s wine for about \u20ac2-4 in supermarkets.\nAlso, Montenegro has boutique wineries as Knezevic from Golubovci and famous brand \"Monte Grande\" became signature wine of the country.\n\n\nBrandy\nThe continental region and north are more oriented towards the production of aromatic fruit flavoured brandy (plum brandy - \u0161ljivovica, apple brandy - jabukova\u010da). Grape brandy \"Montenegrin loza\", \"Prvijenac\", \"Kruna\" or home made grape brandy (lozova rakija, lozova\u010da) is a must-try, and a good choice to \"warm up\" before going out in the evening.\n\n\nBeer\n\"Nik\u0161i\u0107ko\" beer is the best known beer in Montenegro, and most common alcoholic beverage, which cost from \u20ac0.50 to \u20ac2.50. It is produced as a draught beer, or bottled, in both \"Nik Gold\" and lighter \"Nik Cool\" variant. The dark variant, \"Nik tamno\", is praised among beer lovers.\n\n\nOther\nOther alcoholic drinks can cost anywhere between \u20ac1 and \u20ac10.\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nStay safe\n\nMontenegro is generally a safe country. There is, like all countries in the world, criminal activities, but police forces are generally fast in their duties. The number is 122, as well as the international distress call 112. When travelling in the areas bordering Kosovo, it is recommended you keep to the main roads. Unexploded landmines may remain along the Kosovo border. You should also avoid areas where there is military activity.\nIn the resort towns such as Kotor, Budva, Sveti Stefan and Herceg Novi, beggars and pickpockets are not uncommon. As in many other European locations, beggars are part of organized crime groups. Do not give them money.  Doing so may also make you a target for more aggressive approaches.  Always carry your bags in the safest way, slung around your shoulder with the pouch in front (with your money carried under your clothing) where you can keep your arm or hand across it.\nSea urchins are small, globular, spiny sea creatures that cover much of the sea floor off the coast of Montenegro. This isn't a bad thing being as they only gather in super clear water. It's a good idea to wear sea socks or something to cover your feet while walking through the water. Also, if you snorkel, be careful and ensure you don't brush up against the ones on the sides of the rocks.\nMontenegrins are not safe drivers. You will often feel as though you are competing for road space with aggressive drivers who have little regard for your or their own safety. Many people also break the speed limits. Some roads are really narrow. Consequently, the country has one of the highest rates of traffic accident fatalities in Europe.\nThere are two species of viper snakes in Montenegro, sarka and poskok. Both are small but very venomous, so be careful when you hike around, watch your steps and remember that they never attack people if they are not disturbed.\n\n\nStay healthy\nTap water is generally drinkable, though in some small towns it may be better to avoid it.\n\n\nRespect\nShort pants are usually not permitted inside public institutions (hospitals, etc.) Wear modest clothing when visiting monasteries and churches.\nAt beaches, taking off the bottom piece of a swimsuit will likely create a stir and is generally reserved for designated nude beaches.\nWhen toasting and clinking glasses, look the opposite person in the eyes or else it may be taken as a sign of disrespect.\nBeing visibly drunk is a sign of bad taste and character in Montenegro: you may be invited to drink gallons but you're expected to be able to hold it. People also usually prefer to sip their liquor instead of emptying it \"bottoms-up\" style. Be careful: rakija, a plum spirit, is probably going to be stronger than you expect (usually about 53% alcohol content) and will make you drunk fast!\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nInternet\nWi-Fi points in bars and cafeterias are abundant, and most hotels and apartments offer Wi-Fi. Also, many banks have open Wi-Fi spots. Some central tourist areas are also covered by Wi-Fi.\nBe conscious of security when using an unsecured Wi-Fi network.\n\n\nMobile\nYou can buy mobile phone sim cards at the airport, bus station, or malls for \u20ac10-20 by showing your ID or a passport.\nThere are three major network operators on Montenegro: telenor / One, m:tel, and T-Mobile. They all have the same packages as of September 2023: \u20ac10 for 7 days with 500GB, \u20ac15 for 15 days with 500GB, or \u20ac20 for 30 days with 1TB. (That is not a typo. They really offer one terabyte of data.) \n(Bonus tip for Podgorica: If you are running late but desperately need a sim card, go to the mall \"Delta City\" west of the city center. All three providers are present there and it is open until 22:00.)\nMany mobile providers in the Balkans provide free roaming across Balkan countries. So, in case you are planning to cross the border, ask on how to use the local SIM card in other Balkan countries. For instance, a One.al SIM card from Albania works flawlessly in North Macedonia and Kosovo with a regular Albanian package.",
