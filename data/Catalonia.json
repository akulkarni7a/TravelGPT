  "extract": "Catalonia  (Catalan: Catalunya, Spanish: Catalu\u00f1a, Occitan: Catalonha) is an autonomous community in the east of Spain.\nRoman ruins stand as a testament to Catalonia's long history, and the Mediterranean beaches and spectacular mountains draw visitors from around the world. Even as the region has become more cosmopolitan, with the capital Barcelona one of the powerhouses of Europe, Catalans remain fiercely proud and protective of their distinct language and culture.\nCatalonia has produced world-famous artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed, the curvy architecture of Antoni Gaud\u00ed, and Bar\u00e7a football club; not to mention a wide range of natural scenery and unique festivals and traditions.\n\n\nProvinces\n\n\nCities\n1 Barcelona \u2014 extremely vibrant capital which is a must for architecture buffs and foodies\n2 Blanes \u2014 botanical gardens, beaches and modernist buildings\n3 Figueres \u2014 home to the Dal\u00ed museum\n4 Girona \u2014 nice old town with an impressive Jewish quarter, close to the Costa Brava\n5 Lleida \u2014 door to the west Pyrenees mountains, has a Cathedral\n6 Lloret de Mar \u2014 millions of visitors come to this beach resort each year\n7 Reus \u2014 a centre for rock-climbing and the birthplace of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed\n8 Salou \u2014 another popular beach resort in Catalonia\n9 Tarragona \u2014 Roman age capital, has beaches, close to Costa Daurada\n\n\nOther destinations\n\nCatalonia has a great variety of different landscapes very close to each other, mountains on the Pyrenees (at the border with France), green hills on north of the country, agricultural plains on the west and beaches on the east.\n\n1 Costa Brava \u2014 rocky cliffs and a mix of pebble beaches and sandy beaches\n2 Costa Daurada \u2014 lots of sandy beaches near Salou and Tarragona.

Its capital is the famous city of Barcelona.\nCatalonia is today an autonomous region within Spain, but in fact was part of the Crown of Aragon which predates Spain (the Crown of Catalonia-Aragon and the Crown of Castile-Le\u00f3n united to form Spain). Even today, the flag of Catalonia uses the colours of standard of the Crown of Aragon. In 1714, after the War of the Spanish Succession, Catalonia had all its institutions, language and rights suppressed. The region gained its current autonomous status first during the era of the Second Spanish Republic (1930s), but would lose its autonomous status again following the rise of Francisco Franco to power in 1936. Franco was a fascist who desired a strong unified Spanish identity, and proceeded to ban expressions of regional cultures, as well as regional languages, thus making it illegal to speak the Catalan language from 1936\u20131975. Following Franco's death and the transition to democracy, the local languages and cultures were legalised once more. Catalonia once again gained autonomous status, and the Catalan language gained co-official status with Spanish within the region. It continues to press for more political and economic autonomy, mainly in defence of its culture and language and in the form of the right of the Catalan government to collect its own taxes and spend them as it sees fit.\nCatalonia has seen many demonstrations in favour of its independence from Spain; such as the 2013 Catalan Way, 400 km long. A consultation on independence was deemed illegal by Madrid in 2014. A referendum in 2017 got 90% vote in favour of independence on a low voter turnout, but this was again declared illegal by the Spanish government, which attempted to suppress it with police violence at various polling places, and by blocking access to websites with referendum information. After the referendum, the Catalan Parliament declared an independent republic, and on the same day the Spanish Senate voted to enforce direct rule over the region, suspending the regional government. The future political status of Catalonia is uncertain, but so far the pro-independence movement poses no threat to any tourist, and should not discourage travel to the region.\n\n\nTourist information\nCatalonia Tourism website\n\n\nTalk\nThe main languages of Catalonia are Catalan and Spanish. Occitan (Aranese) is an official language in the Aran Valley.\nCatalan (catal\u00e0) is the native language of Catalonia, co-official with Spanish and Aranese. Catalan is also spoken in Andorra, the Balearics, Valencia (where it is called Valencian), La Franja (the eastern strip of Aragon), Alghero in Sardinia, and Roussillon (sometimes called Catalunya Nord, an area that corresponds roughly with the department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales). In everyday use, 12% of the population claim to use both Spanish and Catalan equally, while 36% mainly use Spanish and 46% mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the Barcelona metropolitan area (and, to a lesser extent, the Tarragona area), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the rest of Catalonia, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.\nVisitors who speak Spanish should note that it is called castellano (Catalan castell\u00e0) and that while most people in Catalonia are bilingual in Catalan and Spanish, and are required to learn both languages in school, some people may be reluctant to speak Spanish for political reasons. Nevertheless, locals tend to be more understanding towards foreigners than Spaniards from other regions, and are willing to speak to foreigners in Spanish. Replying in Catalan to a question asked in Spanish is the way to inform the other party that the conversation may continue in Catalan if desired. If you do not speak Catalan, just politely say that you do not understand, and there will be no problem in most cases. At any rate avoid disparaging comments towards the Catalan language or even insinuating it might be a \"dialect\" rather than a language. Learning a few words of Catalan will certainly endear you to Catalan speakers.\nAranese, a subdialect of Gascon (Occitan), is a minority language and only spoken by a couple of thousand people in Val d'Aran in north-west Catalonia. In 2006, it gained official status.\nAs in the rest of Spain, English is not widely spoken, though staff working at major hotels and the main tourist attractions know enough English to communicate. French is widely spoken as a second or third language in the areas near the border with France. By necessity, Catalan speakers tend to be more multilingual than their peers in most of Spain. Don't be surprised to hear some light Andalusian tinge to the Spanish of some, especially those working in tourism. Catalonia has attracted economic migrants from the rest of Spain since it industrialized and continues to do so.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nBarcelona El Prat Airport BCN IATA, about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the city centre of Barcelona, is the principal airport of the region.\nOther airports in Catalonia are:\n\nGirona Airport GRO IATA, in the northeastern part of Catalonia, serves flights  by budget airlines, notably Ryanair. Travel by bus to Barcelona takes about 90 minutes, and there is a bus service into Girona.\nReus Airport REU IATA, in the Tarragona region near Costa Daurada, would be of little note if it hadn't been marketed as being closer to Barcelona than it actually is. Don't be fooled: it is 103 km (64 mi) away, and the journey from here to Barcelona takes at least 2 hours by public transport.\nLleida\u2013Alguaire Airport ILD IATA, in Western Catalonia, serves a few flights from Spanish islands, and the odd flight from the UK.\n\n\nBy train\nThe main train station in Barcelona is called Estaci\u00f3 de Sants, but the most central ones are Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya (most local and regional trains) and Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia (serving some local and most long-distance lines).\nThe Spanish train company is called RENFE. Barcelona is very well connected by train with Madrid, Valencia (City), Zaragoza and the Basque Country in particular and with the whole country in general.\nInside Catalonia, there are frequent trains from the other three provincial capitals (Lleida, Tarragona and Girona).\nA few trains travel across the Pyrenees, but it's possible to reach the eastern part using the train to Tour de Carol (France).\nGoing by train to the Costa Daurada beaches is the best choice, using the line to Tarragona. The Costa Brava isn't well connected by train.\nThe Catalan train company Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) serves destinations near Barcelona, and some tourist routes. It also operates a funicular service in the Pyrenees.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses and coaches connect the principal cities to many national and international locations, and it's the only public transport to get to many local places in Catalonia.\nThe most important bus stations are: Estaci\u00f3 de Sants (Barcelona), mainly for international routes, is next to the train station and very well connected; and the Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (also in Barcelona), close to Passeig de Sant Joan, is the main bus station for medium and long routes - the nearest metro (Line 1) and RENFE station is Arc de Triomf.\nThe routes inside Catalonia are held by different companies, which leave from different places. Every town has normally only one company, so you should ask at some information point, or check online [1] which, although in Catalan, is quite easy to use (put the origin at the left, the destination at the right, and gives the name of the company and its telephone number).\n\n\nBy boat\nCatalonia has many ports. The main commercial ports are:\n\n1 Port of Barcelona, \u260f + 34 93 298 60 00, sau@portdebarcelona.cat.   (updated Aug 2023)\n2 Port of Tarragona, Passeig de l'Escullera s/n, 43004 Tarragona, \u260f +34 977 25 94 00.  (updated Aug 2023)\n\n\nSee\n\nBarcelona is a modern city with lots of historical heritage including magnificent examples of Gothic and Modernist architectures. Home of the Sagrada Familia and other Antoni Gaud\u00ed buildings such as Parc Guell and La Pedrera. Barcelona is also well known for its museums and cultural events.\nThe Roman ruins including the complex and colosseum in Tarragona and the ruins in Castell\u00f3 d'Emp\u00faries.\nEnjoy the long fine sand beaches of Costa Daurada and the grain beaches on Costa Brava\nSee the volcanoes near the city of Olot, and La Fageda d'en Jord\u00e0, a very nice forest and extinct volcanoes.\nCastells, human towers made by castellers who stand on each other's shoulders, forming six, seven, eight, or even more layers of people. An incredible and distinctively Catalan tradition popular at festes and friendly competitions. Not often publicised for visitors, but if you have a Catalan friend or can puzzle through the online information in Catalan, it's well worth your while.\n\n\nUNESCO listed sites\n\nUNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves:\n\n1 Montseny Natural Park\n2 Terres de l\u2019Ebre \u2014 in Province of Tarragona\n3 Val d'Aran Biosphere Reserve \u2014 in Lleida (province)\nUNESCO World Heritage List sites:\n\n1 Works of Antoni Gaudi \u2014 Park G\u00fcell, Palau G\u00fcell, Casa Mil\u00e0, Casa Vicens, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Casa Batll\u00f3, Cripta de la Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell\n2 Poblet Abbey  \u2014 (Reial Monestir de Santa Maria de Poblet) in Tarragona (province)\n3 Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau \u2014 in Barcelona\n4 Archaeological Ensemble of T\u00e1rraco  \u2014 in Tarragona\n5 Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Bo\u00ed  \u2014 in Province of Lleida\n Rock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula in Catalonia \u2014\nUNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage:\n\n1 Patum de Berga \n Human Towers (Castells)  \u2014\nUNESCO creative cities:\n\n1 Barcelona \u2014 Literature city\nUNESCO Geoparks:\n\n1 Central Catalunya UNESCO Global Geopark \u2014\n2 Conca de Tremp\u2013Montsec UNESCO Global Geopark \u2014\n\n\nItineraries\nCatalan Way of St. James \u2013 one branch of the Way of St. James pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela\nEbro Way of St. James \u2013 another branch, which partly coincides with the GR 99 Camino del Ebro\n\n\nDo\n\n\nAdventure sports\nWater activities are practiced in a lot of places in Catalonia like Llavors\u00ed in the Pyrenees.\n\n\nFestes\nCatalonia has hundreds of \"festes\" that go on around the region every week of the year. The closest word in English to translate \"festa\" would be \"festival\" but this is inadequate to describe the type of celebration that exists in Catalonia. \"Festes\" are ritual like celebrations that have been passed down through generations of people for more than 700 years. They are organized by the people of a town for their own enjoyment, and not for any commercial interest. \"Festival\" (which also exists in the Catalan and Castilian languages) denotes an event that is usually organized by a specific group of people for a particular market, and is often motivated by economic interest.\n\u201cFestes\u201d have ritual like sequences of events that usually involve Giants, Devils, Human Castles and processions. A magical atmosphere is created at the \u201cfesta\u201d, almost like a type of Catharsis. \u201cFestes\u201d stem from Medieval Times when fantastical dragons and Giants were created to instruct people about religion in church services. Shortly after the fantastical creatures became a part of the Corpus Christi processions that paraded through the town during the summer. The importance given to these folkloric elements has gradually increased over time and now they have assumed a national importance. Nowadays, these traditions are associated with Catalan identity as something that is individual and separate from the rest of Spain.\nThese \u201cfestes\u201d are not greatly publicized by the Catalan government for visitors.\n\n\nBirdwatching\nBecause of its geographical location and terrific range of habitats, including dry steppes, rocky coastlines, mountains and some of the most important wetland sites in Europe, Catalonia has a greater variety of bird life than anywhere else on the peninsula, with 95% of Iberia's and 50% of the whole Palearctic's recorded bird species.\nSome of the most sought-after are the bearded vulture, black woodpecker, wallcreeper, Bonelli's eagle, lesser grey shrike, little bustard, pin-tailed sandgrouse, Audouin's gull and lesser crested tern. The most important sites are Cap de Creus Natural Park, Aiguamolls de l'Empord\u00e0 Natural Park, Barcelona's Llobregat Delta, the Parc del Garraf, Ebro Delta, the Steppes of Lleida and, of course, the Pyrenees.\nThere are a few companies that will organise tours for you, or even offer free advice, including Catalan Bird Tours and Oliva Rama Tours. There is also the Birdinginspain.com web site which offers birding sites and itineraries and lots of other useful information to help you plan your ornithological trip to Catalonia.\n\n\nEat\nThere are lots of good places to eat.\nAt lunch time (13-15:00 approx.), many restaurants (and some bars) offer a men\u00fa del migdia / men\u00fa del d\u00eda (menu of the day), which usually means a three course meal (a first plate often a salad or rice-based or pasta-based dish, a second plate usually a meat or fish, and a drink; plus a dessert or coffee), 3 or 4 options for each course, for \u20ac12 to \u20ac20, depending on the restaurant. The portions may be quite generous, or rather small. Some bars also offer \"Plats Combinats\" which are a few items served together at reasonable prices - e.g. Hamburger, egg and chips.\nIn all the medium-sized cities, you can expect to find a large range of possibilities.\nIn the 21st century, Catalonia has also emerged has one of the world's premier fine dining hubs, with an exceptionally high concentration of celebrity chefs.\n\n\nCatalan cuisine\nUsually announced as Cuina Casolana, based on the purposes of the Mediterranean diet: soups, salads, meats, fish and seafood, snails (especially in Lleida during \"L'Aplec del Cargol\" by early May), desserts, pastries...\n\nPa amb tom\u00e0quet: \"bread with tomato\". Many people in Spain are surprised when discover the Catalan way to prepare \"pa amb tom\u00e0quet\", because instead of being sliced tomato with bread, the tomato (sometimes with garlic) is squashed and spread in the bread slice, dressed with extra virgin olive oil and small cuts of a very Catalan specialty: cured pork meat, that is, the famous Iberian ham (Spanish jam\u00f3n, Catalan pernil), fuet, chorizo (xori\u00e7o), botifarra (spicy cured sausages), sobrassada, or other stuff like cheese or larger pieces of cooked meat. \"Pa amb tom\u00e0quet\" is a very deeply rooted meal in Catalan houses.\nPaella - Typical rice dish from the Catalan Lands. Catalan paella is with seafood, while Valencian paella is without seafood. There's also a variant of paella which is made up with little noodles called \"fideu\u00e0\". In addition, paella and fideu\u00e0 can be prepared with black squid ink, then it's called \"fideu\u00e0 negra\" or \"arr\u00f2s negre\" (black fideu\u00e0 and black rice respectively).\nBotifarra amb Mongetes - grilled sausage with beans. The butifarra is made of fresh pork meat with spices and is grilled. The beans are boiled and then fried with bacon. Usually served with all-i-oli (cold garlic and oil sauce)\n\nCal\u00e7otada is a full meal, available from Christmas until mid April, based on the cal\u00e7ot, a kind of young onion grilled and eaten with a sauce. Usually the dish comprises assorted grilled meats, and some dessert after that. Although from Tarragona (province), today it is available in most of Catalonia, usually at countryside restaurants. This is usually a group meal, but is also available for couples or families.\nEscudella i carn d'olla is a traditional meat and vegetable stew or soup. It is characterised by the use of a pilota, a very big meatball seasoned with garlic and parsley; it also contains vegetables such as celery, cabbage or carrots, depending on the season. Escudella is typically served in two parts: the escudella proper is a soup consisting of a broth with pasta, rice or both. The carn d'olla is all the meat used in the broth, served afterwards in a tray along with the vegetables used. When both parts are served mixed together, it is called escudella barred. A version of this soup called escudella de Nadal (Christmas soup) or sopa de galets and is very popular on Christmas Day.\nCaragols a la llauna is a simple dish of snails either grilled, or oven-roasted in a llauna (tin pan). They are served with aioli or vinaigrette. The dish is particularly favoured in Lleida, where it has been promoted since 1980 by the Aplec del Caragol de Lleida.\nTrinxat is a food from the Pyrenees, principally Andorra and the Catalan comarques of Cerdanya and Alt Urgell. It is made with potatoes, cabbage and pork meat, and resembles the English dish bubble and squeak.\nEscalivada consists of roasted aubergine and peppers with olive oil and sometimes onion, tomato, minced garlic, and salt. Usually served cold, like a salad.\n\nCoca cookies in four main varieties: sweet, savoury, closed and open. All of them use dough as the main ingredient, which is then decorated. Coca de recapte is a widely-available savoury coca with a variety of different ingredients, usually including sausage and vegetables (aubergine, pepper, onion). Coca de Sant Joan is a sweet coca with fruits eaten on Saint John's Eve (23 June)\nCrema catalana, similar to a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, is a custard made from egg yolks, milk, sugar, cornflour, and aromatics, typically lemon zest, cinnamon, or vanilla, with a crisp caramel crust. The first known recipe dates back 14th century.\nMona de pascua, is a cake with a Chocolate egg on top, traditionally eaten on Easter Monday. It is customary for godparents to give a mona to their godchild. Sometimes the chocolate egg is replaced by a large chocolate figure, and sometimes this even replaces the cake.\n Tortell is round, made of puff pastry, and stuffed with trufa (a mixture of cacao, chocolate and cream), whipped cream or crema catalana. It is typically bought and eaten after Sunday lunch, in family or with friends.\nBra\u00e7 de gitano (gypsy's arm) is like a Swiss roll made of whipped cream and sponge cake.\n\n\nBooks to read\nConsider checking books by Carmen Casas, a restaurant critic and a world-renowned expert on Catalan cuisine.\n\n\nOther cuisines\nCuisines from other regions can be readily found in cities of Catalonia:\n\nTapas - Typical Spanish\nBasque food\nItalian food - Pasta, pizzas, ...\nChinese food\nJapanese food\nFast food\n\n\nDrink\nDon't miss the Catalan wine and Cava. Catalonia has a very rich tradition of wine makers, and today it is a producer of world famous wines. \"Pened\u00e8s\", \"Priorat\", \"Costers del Segre\", \"Alella\" and \"Terra Alta\" are good \"DOP\"s (\"Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida\" or designation of protected origin, the Spanish administrative division to control and preserve wine producing areas). Vermouth, a fortified wine, is a very popular local drink, usually drunk as a late morning / midday aperitif. Sangr\u00eda is also served in most restaurants, with large variations in quality, and mainly made for tourists.\n\n\nSleep\n Xanascat. A group of 48 youth hostels offer low-priced accommodations in various Catalonian communities. \n\n\nStay safe\n\nCatalonia is usually a safe place. Be aware of pickpockets in crowds and don't leave your car unwatched in motorway rest areas. Tourist areas such as Las Ramblas in Barcelona city attract many petty thieves so you should be vigilant. As a tourist, you are a target for thieves. They can spot you and you cannot spot them. Do not carry all your money and documentation in the same bag or pocket.  If you have been robbed, always go to the police.\nIf you are driving, follow traffic regulations or you may be fined. If you are fined, you will have to pay in cash immediately; otherwise, your car will be removed from the road. Therefore, have at least \u20ac200 with you, just in case.\nEver since the 2017 independence referendum which many opponents of independence view as illegal and the subsequent trial of pro independence figures involved in the referendum which handed down lengthy jail sentences, there have been widespread mass protests in Catalonia, sometimes involving police violence or violence by protesters. While you should be fine if you keep out of politics altogether and the Catalan population is pretty much evenly split in pro- and anti-independence camps, even peaceful protests can become violent without much advance notice so as a visitor, you are advised to just stay away from protests. Protesters also sometimes block major highways or airports to communicate their displeasure and draw attention to their cause, so be prepared to make alternative arrangements if this conflicts with your travel plans.\n\n\nRespect\nYou should always be fully clothed away from beaches and swimming pools. It is very annoying for local people to see tourists wandering around half-naked. Try to remember that you are a guest in another country and respect the fact that even though you are on vacation, most of the people around you live here and are trying to go about their normal lives. For example, avoid making a lot of noise late at night, as people will be sleeping.\nBe aware that people usually have breakfast at 9AM, lunch at 2PM and dinner at 9PM or later. This schedule may seem a little weird but it is like this because of the sun hours. Traditionally, people worked the fields when the sun was least strong, which is early morning and late afternoon. So after working from dawn, they had a snack at 9AM or 10AM, ate lunch at 2PM, then back to work between 3PM and 4PM, after which they would come home and eat dinner at 9PM. The tradition as a whole is gradually disappearing, due to increased urbanization and the abandonment of traditional farming practices, but people have largely kept the eating schedule.\nCatalonia has an active independence movement, and Catalan society is deeply divided on this issue. As a visitor, tread lightly in discussions of the issue.\n\n\nGo next\nAndorra \u2014 a tiny mountainous country in the Pyrenees, famous for its beautiful views, ski resorts, and low taxes\nAragon \u2014 with close historical ties to Catalonia, this autonomous community to the west has a distinctive culture and picturesque countryside.\nBalearic Islands \u2014 a tourist hotspot in the Mediterranean, including the world-famous party destination Ibiza, a short ride from Catalonia by plane or ferry\nPyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales \u2014 also known as \"Northern Catalonia\", a department of France with historical, linguistic, and cultural ties to Catalonia\nValencian Community \u2014 an autonomous community to the south of Catalonia, with beautiful weather and extensive beaches",
