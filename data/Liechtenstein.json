  "extract": "The Principality of Liechtenstein (German: F\u00fcrstentum Liechtenstein) is a tiny, alpine, German-speaking country with a population of 38,000, doubly landlocked by Switzerland and Austria.\nThe principality enjoys a very high standard of living and is home to some incredibly beautiful mountain scenery. The principality's capital, Vaduz, is a major centre of commerce and international banking.\n\n\nTowns\n\n1 Vaduz \u2014 capital of Liechtenstein and the seat of government, despite never officially having been granted city status\n2 Balzers \u2014 this town is home to a very beautiful church and castle\n3 Malbun  \u2014 an area for skiing and snowboarding\n4 Schaan \u2014 the largest populated area in the country\n5 Triesen  \u2014 a small town south of Vaduz\n6 Triesenberg  \u2014 an alpine town high in Liechtenstein's mountains\n7 Ruggell  \u2014 a town in northern Liechtenstein where there is a nature reserve of rare plants and animals\n8 Bendern  \u2014 where Liechtenstein was born in 1699\n9 Nendeln  \u2014 where there are a ceramics works and Roman ruins\n10 Schellenberg  \u2014 a town with a museum of rural homes\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nWhat is now the Principality of Liechtenstein was for a long time the minor holdings of a powerful noble family from elsewhere. It was part of the Holy Roman Empire and later became part of the German Confederation.\nIn 1866 Liechtenstein changed its alignment from the by then-dissolved German Confederation to Austria-Hungary until the end of World War I, when the economic devastation and the breakdown of the dual monarchy caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to conclude a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's reputation as a \"tax haven\" has spurred outstanding economic growth. Outside of banking, Liechtenstein's main economic activities are the production of false teeth and tourism.\n\nThe Liechtensteinian flag is, by pure accident of history, identical to that of Haiti except for the emblems placed on both. During the 1936 Olympics, which were apparently the first time the two flags were displayed close to each other, this was discovered as Haitian civil flags at the time omitted the coat of arms and Liechtenstein added the crown as a symbol of its monarchy and to distinguish it from the civil flag of Haiti, should the two ever be displayed alongside each other.\nShortcomings in banking regulatory oversight have resulted in concerns about the use of the financial institutions for money laundering and tax evasion. However, the days of bringing suitcases of money into banks for deposit with no questions asked are over. \nLiechtensteiners are also very proud of the fact that their nation has never been involved in a battle or military confrontation with an enemy state. They see their flag as a banner of peace.\nFor a European country, the aristocratic element in the constitution is rather strong and the prince/regent has a lot of powers both in theory and in reality (unlike say the British monarch). However, unlike almost all monarchies in the world there is a provision in the constitution that the prince has to resign and the monarchy has to be abandoned if a majority of the people so desire.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nDespite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large European neighbours. The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes, the maximum tax rate is 20%, and easy incorporation rules have induced a large number of holding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. Perhaps the most notable company from Liechtenstein is Hilti, not a bank, but a manufacturer of power tools (though they aren't made in Liechtenstein any longer). Liechtenstein is the world's leading producer of false teeth.\nLiechtenstein participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses Swiss francs as its national currency interchangeably with the Liechtenstein frank. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been, since May 1995, a member of the European Economic Area, an organization serving as a bridge between the EFTA and the EU. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Liechtenstein has one of the highest personal income rates (GDP per capita) in the world, with the base rate of income tax at just 1.2%.\n\n\nGeography\nLiechtenstein is very mountainous, and is double-landlocked \u2014 one of only two countries in the world to be landlocked by landlocked countries (Uzbekistan is the other). \nMost of the country's population lives in the long and wide Rhine Valley in the western third. Roads are mainly laid out in a north-south pattern following the valley as well. To the north, the main roads lead to the border with Austria, to the south, they enter Switzerland, and to the west across the river the bridges also cross into Switzerland. Most of the eastern border with Austria is not passable and is only accessible by foot as it is very mountainous, though the north of the country is well connected by road to Feldkirch in Austria. The country's highest point is the Grauspitz, which reaches 2,599 m. Among other European microstates, Liechtenstein is 2.5 times bigger than San Marino and 81 times bigger than Monaco.\n\n\nClimate\nLiechtenstein has a continental climate featuring cold, cloudy winters with frequent snow or rain, making the country a moderately popular ski destination. Summers are cool to moderately warm, also often cloudy and humid.\n\n\nTourist information\nTourist information website\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: German phrasebook\nThe official language is German, but the main language in everyday use is an Alemannic dialect, that can be hard to understand even for native speakers of standard German. The Alemannic dialect group is also spoken in German-speaking Eastern Switzerland, the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and the Austrian state of Vorarlberg. While the dialect is on the retreat in Germany and to some extent even in Austria, it is alive and well in Switzerland and Liechtenstein with some even fearing a local extinction of standard German due to lack of situations in which it is actually spoken.\nAlmost everyone can speak standard German, and English is also prevalent. French and Latin are also widely taught in the secondary public school system. Some shops have personnel who can address Asian tourists in their respective languages.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nEntry requirements\nLiechtenstein is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\n\nLiechtenstein is not a member of the EU. Therefore, travellers entering Liechtenstein from Austria (and vice versa) are subject to non-systematic customs controls. There have been no immigration controls since Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011. If you want a passport stamp, it is available for CHF3 or \u20ac3 at any Tourist Office.\nLiechtenstein maintains a complete customs union with Switzerland and is represented by Switzerland in embassies internationally. Since 1923 there have been no border formalities needed for crossing between the two countries. In essence there is nothing more than a sign announcing your arrival in Switzerland or Liechtenstein (when you cross the Rhine or the land border), similar to the situation at smaller border crossings in many EU nations (e.g., Austria, Germany, France, Italy).\nMeasures to combat COVID-19 in Liechtenstein have been lifted. However, there may also be Swiss regulations to consider in regards to entry. For updates and the latest information, check Liechtenstein's tourism website and the Liechtenstein Government's COVID-19 portal (Website in German). (Jan 2023)\n\n\nBy plane\nLiechtenstein has no airports. You can take a flight to Z\u00fcrich Airport (ZRH IATA), 115 km from Liechtenstein. Although this is the only major airport near Liechtenstein, there are some limited services from Vienna to St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport (53 km) by Austrian Arrows. There is also a private airport in Bad Ragaz, very close to the border. Another popular point of entry is through Friedrichshafen in Germany, which is served by low-cost airlines.\nLiechtenstein has a heliport in the Southern Lowlands. This heliport has no passport control so helicopters are only allowed to go inside the Schengen Area. There is a heliport near the border at Feldkirch, Austria where passport control can be organised.\n\n\nBy train or bus\nFlixbus has rides to Vaduz from Munich, Bregenz, Lindau, Milan, Lugano and Chur . (updated Apr 2024)\n\u00d6BB, the Austrian federal railway company, runs a limited service from Buchs SG station in Switzerland, via Schaan-Vaduz station (near Schaan) to Feldkirch in Austria. Trains only run a few times a day, which makes buses generally more convenient. \nBuses run every 15 minutes from the train station at Buchs (the main Swiss town on the Liechtenstein border) to Schaan and Vaduz. Tickets can be purchased on the bus for Fr. 3.40 and it only takes about 10 minutes to Schaan and another 5 to Vaduz. Vaduz is the only European capital in a country that otherwise has a rail network not connected to any rail line and there are (as of 2017) no plans to change that.\nIf coming by rail from Switzerland, it may be quicker and cheaper to take the train as far as Sargans, from where it's possible to catch a bus (see below) straight to Vaduz. Consult the SBB timetable to find out what'll be quickest when you're travelling. There are lockers at the Sargans station so you can leave your luggage there.\nThe Liechtenstein Buses Route 12 runs from Sargans railway station to Buchs railway station via central Vaduz and Schaan railway station. It leaves from outside each station approximately every 20 minutes. The buses are yellow-green in colour. A fare to Vaduz is Fr. 5.80 from Sargans and Fr. 3.40 from Buchs. There are student prices as well (be sure to show your student ID). Consider getting a whole network day pass (Fr. 12) or week pass (Fr. 24) if you are making many journeys, though two single fares (e.g., from Sargans or Buchs to Vaduz and Vaduz onward to Feldkirch) cost less than a day pass.\nFrom Feldkirch railway station in Austria, look for the distinctive off-yellow Liechtenstein Buses. Numbers 11 and 14 head straight to Vaduz and number 13 goes to Buchs railway station, by-passing Vaduz, so you'll have to change at the Schaan interchange.\n\n\nBy car\nLiechtenstein has no highways, but the Swiss Autobahn A13/E34 runs along the Swiss side of the Rhine River, the border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein. There are several access points that cross the Rhine into Liechtenstein, the two that are most commonly used are the bridge crossing into the southern town of Balzers and the crossing into Vaduz. If you aren't coming from the west or have a Swiss vignette already, it may make sense to avoid Swiss highways as there is only a year vignette.\nThe alternative is to reach Liechtenstein via Austria. Coming from Germany, you most likely will also buy a vignette which is available in a 10 day variety that is much cheaper than the Swiss year version. You enter Liechtenstein directly from the north, via the Austrian city of Feldkirch which is also a tourist attraction.\nDriving in Liechtenstein is relatively safe, but extra care should be taken on narrow and winding mountain roads. Speed traps are common, and for good reason as the roads are not made for high speeds.\nVaduz has several parking garages and places. As the city is not very large you can hardly make a poor choice. The prices don't differ that much.\n\n\nHitch-hiking\nVery easy from Feldkirch in Austria. In rush hour, lots of commuters head into the capital. A simple sign as you stand by the main road in Feldkirch should get you a lift within minutes.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy public transit\nFor a rural area of its size and wealth, Liechtenstein's bus system is decent and well patronized. The country's sole bus operator is Liemobil. Fares are reasonable. A day ticket costs Fr. 12 (as of Jan 2024) and a 7-day unlimited use card costs Fr. 24. Single ride tickets can be purchased from the driver, or through FAIRTIQ or SBB Mobile apps.\n\n\nBy bike\nAnother cheap way to travel, weather permitting, is by bike. The roads in Liechtenstein are in excellent condition and many (in the Balzers-Schaan corridor) even offer bike lanes. Biking through the whole country (entering from Austria going all the way south through to Switzerland) takes only a few hours, but is worth every minute of the wonderful alpine scenery!\n\n\nBy car\nLiechtenstein is a very sluggish place to drive. The majority of the roads are either uphill on extremely steep and winding stretches or in populated regions. If it has one, the automatic gearbox should be in sport setting there. The valley also has straighter roadways. The roads are frequently a little congested, particularly in the direction of Vaduz.\nSpeed restrictions are prominently displayed. Some sections of the road between cities are 80 km/h, but primarily within the 50 km/h zone. Because of how slowly the interior roads move, navigators frequently suggest taking the highway just across the border in Switzerland. There are no national highways in the nation.\nBy foot\nLiechtenstein is full of well-marked and -maintained hiking trails. The 'Liechtenstein Weg' is a 77-km path that crosses the entire country, from Balzers to Schaaneald, while doing some loops and going a bit into the mountains. It is divided into 5 stages, but realistically manageable in 2-3 days. If you would walk the main high way, you could cross the country in one day. \n\n\nSee\nLiechtenstein boasts a number of attractions that are of interest to visitors.\n\n Balzers - Home to a beautiful church and a spectacular Gothic castle.\n Vaduz - The capital is the main shopping area in the country, with many souvenir stores and assorted restaurants. The city is also home to a modest cathedral and the decade-old Liechtenstein Kunstmuseum. A ski museum is north of downtown.\n1 Schloss Vaduz  - This imposing and historic castle, home to the royal family, overlooks the city of Vaduz and is approachable on the main Vaduz-Triesenberg road (bus route 21). It is not open to the public, but it is possible to view it from quite close up.\nIt is possible to encounter the royal family at the Kunstmuseum, coming in and out of Schloss Vaduz or skiing during winter time.  This is one benefit of such a small country. They are recognizable in their cars, which use their birth year for their licence plate number.\n\nThe mountain ranges within Liechtenstein are filled with tall peaks. Both lie within the eastern and western Alps and display climbing options.\n\n\nDo\nLiechtenstein offers great hiking, road biking, and mountain biking terrain. Skiing and snowboarding are also offered at a reasonable price at the country's small resort, Malbun, in comparison to the expensive lift prices in neighbouring Switzerland or Austria.\nGet up early one morning and drive up the mountains on the east side of the river. From here you have an incredible view over Vaduz & Switzerland.\nLiechtenstein is popular among philatelists and even has a postal museum. You can also get an entry stamp of Liechtenstein in your passport at the tourist centre and some souvenir shops (Fr. 3 or \u20ac3).\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nLiechtenstein uses the Swiss franc (CHF) as its currency. Many shops will also accept euros, but the exchange rate may not be very advantageous and you will get your change in Euro. An exception are supermarkets, where you will usually get the best exchange rate, which makes it a good place for exchanging your Euros into Francs: buy something and pay with a bigger euro bill, they accept up to 100\u20ac bills (especially if you continue to Switzerland afterwards and want to exchange money) For a short visit you might not need francs at all though, as even the parking garage accepts euros. \n\n\nCosts\nCosts in Liechtenstein are roughly equivalent to those in Switzerland and are therefore somewhat more expensive than other European countries.\n\n\nEat\nYou will find a few restaurants in the larger cities of Liechtenstein. There is also a McDonald's restaurant (opened in 1996; serves wine), which is very popular and is widely publicised by road signs throughout the country.\nThe many small bakeries are a great place to get a warm, fresh roll or pastry.\n\n\nDrink\n\nThere is a small amount of wine that is produced in Liechtenstein that is available in supermarkets and tourist shops throughout the country.  Expect to pay around Fr. 25 for an average bottle. The Prince owns his own vineyard in Vaduz, off the main road. Beer is also available for purchase that is made with malt from Liechtenstein, although most of the beer is brewed in Switzerland.  A variety of other European wines, beers, and soft drinks are also available. There is now a brewery in Liechtenstein that produces a variety of beers; lagers including Helles (blonde) and Hefe Weizen (unfiltered wheat) styles are brewed.\nThere is also a one-man distillery in Triesen which makes liquors and schnapps from fruits.  Tours on Saturdays.\n\n\nSleep\nThere are a few hotels in Liechtenstein, but they tend to be on the expensive side.  There is one youth hostel [1] located in Schaan, but it closes for the winter.  You will probably be able to find cheaper accommodation in neighboring Feldkirch, Austria.\nCamping Mittagspitz is the only full-service campsite in the Principality.  It offers excellent facilities, a friendly reception and a fabulous reasonably priced restaurant. Fares for pitching a tent are around 22\u20ac + 2\u20ac tourist tax (April 2024) There are three other campgrounds in Liechtenstein: one in Bendern, one in Vaduz, and one in Triesen.  All are pretty much full year round.\n\n Gasthaus Krone, Dorf 36, 9488 Schellenberg (next to post office and bus-station), \u260f +423 373 1168. Very inexpensive rooms. Family run hotel and restaurant. 15 km away from Vaduz, regular (hourly) bus service to all parts of Liechtenstein. Fr. 60 (dbl). \n\n\nLearn\nLiechtenstein's university offers courses only in technical sciences.\n\n1 University of Liechtenstein (Universit\u00e4t Liechtenstein).   (updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nWork\nCitizens of all EEA countries and Switzerland have an unrestricted right to work in Liechtenstein. However, to live in Liechtenstein, you will need a residence permit, and only very few of these are issued. This means that if you get a job in Liechtenstein, you will most probably have to live in Austria or Switzerland and commute into Liechtenstein daily.\nIf you are not a citizen of the EEA or Switzerland, getting a job in Liechtenstein is very difficult.\n\n\nStay safe\nLiechtenstein is easily one of the safest countries in the world, though it is not without its problems. The most common crime in Liechtenstein is of a non-violent nature, though the principality maintains a well-equipped police force which maintains a presence on the streets. In the late 1990s, the Liechtenstein Landespolizei launched a crackdown on prostitution in Vaduz. Considering the largest cities nearby are Innsbruck and Z\u00fcrich, outside of Schaan and Vaduz, the whole place can seem very rural. Drunk drivers and winter road conditions may be your only \"realistic\" concern. Speed limits are strictly enforced by speed cameras, which can lead to high fines. Don't speed, enjoy the scenery instead.\nThe country's beautiful scenery is also very dangerous. Cases of hikers finding themselves in difficulty are very common, and extreme care should be taken when leaving the well-marked trails. Follow local advice, read local weather forecasts (newspapers in the principality print individual forecasts for the different cities in Liechtenstein, which is beneficial because the difference in altitude often cause different weather conditions), and ensure that you have the correct equipment before setting out.\n\n\nStay healthy\nThere are excellent medical facilities in Liechtenstein, but it is more likely that you would be transferred to a hospital in Switzerland should you require medical attention. If you are an Austrian or EU citizen you may want to seek medical attention in next-door Feldkirch, Austria.\nTap water is safe to drink.\n\n\nRespect\n\nThe Principality of Liechtenstein has existed for centuries as an independent state and this should be remembered. Liechtensteiners are very proud of their national identity and would take offence at being wrongly labelled \"German\", \"Austrian\" or \"Swiss\". \nRemember that this is a traditional Catholic country. On Sundays, the streets are almost dead except for the tourists and the tourist shops.\nThe Prince of Liechtenstein and the Monarchy are well respected in Liechtenstein. Bear that in mind when conversing with the locals.\n\n\nConnect\nAs of Sept 2021, the country has 4G from all Swiss carriers, but 5G has not yet arrived. The Austrian signal doesn't reach here because of the mountains. Wifi is widely available in public places.\n\n\nGo next\nFrom Liechtenstein, going to the picturesque Austrian city of Feldkirch is a natural choice. The closest larger city of Switzerland is St. Gallen with its monasterial complex.\nLiechtenstein can be seen as part of the German-Swiss-Austrian Lake Constance with many wonderful destinations.",
