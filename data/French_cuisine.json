  "extract": "Many people of France regard their cuisine to be the best in the world. France is the origin of the Guide Michelin rating system, and ties Japan (which has twice the population) for the highest number of stars in the guidebook.\nFrench cuisine has set a standard for fine dining around the world, and chefs and gastronomes across the Western world make extensive use of French culinary terms.\n\n\nUnderstand\nSee also: Kingdom of France\nFrench cuisine has roots back to the Roman Empire. Influenced by Italian cuisine as well as local traditions, haute cuisine was created in Paris during the Early Modern times. The French Revolution put an end to guilds and the privileged noble class, expanding fine cooking and dining to common people.\nWhile foreign cuisines such as Mexican food, American fast food and Chinese food have been less successful in France than in other parts of Europe, they can be found in Paris and the other more cosmopolitan cities. North African, Vietnamese and Middle Eastern cuisines, and even occasionally sub-Saharan African cuisines (especially from Senegal) in areas with large African communities, are among those that have been imported from former French colonies and taken root in the former mother country. At least some North African food has been fully assimilated, as a survey in the 1990s found that couscous was the most popular French food (so described by the respondents) in France.\nConversely, French cuisine has also influenced the cuisines of its former colonial possessions, with the cuisines of Quebec and Louisiana having a strong French influence, albeit with the incorporation of many local North American flavours and ingredients, and a modified version of the French baguette has been widely adopted in Vietnam for use in the ubiquitous b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwiches.\n\n\nMeals\nBreakfast (petit d\u00e9jeuner) in France isn't the most important meal of the day, and is usually very light. The most typical breakfast consists of a coffee and a croissant or some other \"viennoiserie\", but since it implies going to the boulangerie early in the morning to buy fresh croissants, it's typically reserved for somewhat special occasions. On normal days most people have a beverage (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, orange juice) and either toast (\"tartines\" made of baguette or toast bread with butter and jam/honey/Nutella) that can be dipped in the hot beverage, or cereals with milk. People who eat healthy may go for fruit and yoghurt. As a general rule, the French breakfast is mostly sweet, but anything can change and you can have savoury breakfasts everywhere today.\nBoth lunch (d\u00e9jeuner) and dinner (d\u00eener) are traditionally full meals. They often consist of an appetiser (entr\u00e9e or hors d'\u0153uvre), a main dish (plat), and a dessert (dessert) or cheese. Restaurants usually serve dinner between 19:30 and 21:30; eating dinner before around 19:00 is considered very odd and chances are that anyone you see eating at a restaurant before this time is a tourist.\n\n\nIngredients\nBread (pain) is the classical side order in France. The baguette, a plain wheat roll, is the archetypal bread.\nCheese (fromage) comes in hundreds of varieties, and can be included in most dishes. It often makes up a dessert. Here is a far from exhaustive list of what one can find:\nBleu des Causses\nLivarot\nRoquefort\nBleu du Vercors\nMorbier\nSaint Nectaire\nBoulette d'Avesnes\nMaroilles\nSalers\nBrie de Meaux  \nMunster\nSainte Maure de Touraine\nBrie de Melun\nMurol\nSelles-sur-Cher\nBroccio\nNeufch\u00e2tel\nSaint Marcellin\nCamembert  \nOssau-Iraty\nSainte Maure de Touraine\nCantal\nPelardon\nTomme de ch\u00e8vre\nChaource\nP\u00e9rail\nTomme des C\u00e9vennes\nComt\u00e9\nPicodon\nValen\u00e7ay\n\n\nRegional dishes\nEvery French region has dishes all its own. These dishes follow the resources (game, fish, agriculture, etc.) of the region, the vegetables (cabbage, turnip, endives, etc.) which they grow there. Here is a small list of regional dishes which you can find easily in France. Generally each region has a unique and widespread dish (usually because it was food for the masses), while in Alsace, the local cuisine shares many similarities with German cuisine, with a focus on simple and hearty meat-based dishes.\n\nCassoulet (Southwest France) : beans, duck, pork & sausages\nChoucroutes, or sauerkraut (Alsace) : stripped fermented cabbage + pork\nFondue Savoyarde (central Alps) : melted/hot cheese with white wine\nFondue Bourguignonne (Burgundy) : pieces of beef (in boiled oil), usually served with a selection of various sauces.\nRaclette (central Alps) : melted cheese & potatoes/meat\nPot-au-feu (found all over France) : boiled beef with vegetables\nB\u0153uf Bourguignon (Burgundy) : slow cooked beef with red wine gravy\nGratin dauphinois (Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes) : oven-roasted slices of potatoes with sour cream and cheese\nAligot (Aveyron) : melted cheese mixed with a pur\u00e9e of potatoes\nBouillabaisse (fish + saffron) (Marseille and the French Riviera). Don't be fooled! A real bouillabaisse is a really expensive dish due to the amount of fresh fish it requires. Be prepared to pay at least \u20ac30 per person. If you find restaurants claiming to serve bouillabaisse for something like \u20ac15 per person, you'll find it to be of a very poor quality.\nTartiflette (Savoie) : Melted Reblochon cheese, potatoes and pork or bacon.\nConfit de Canard (south west) : Duck Confit, consists of legs and wings bathing in grease. That grease is actually very healthy and, with red wine, is one of the identified sources of the so-called \"French Paradox\" (eat richly, live long).\nFoie Gras (south west) : The liver of a duck or goose. Although usually quite expensive, foie gras can be found in supermarkets for a lower price (because of their purchasing power) around the Christmas season. It is the time of year when most foie gras is consumed in France. It goes very well with Champagne.\nMoules marini\u00e8res (found anywhere there's a coast): Mussels steamed in white wine, garlic and shallots, normally served with crusty bread and French fries. This combo, Belgian in origin, is also called moules-frites. There are numerous regional varieties. Add cream and sometimes lardons, then you've got moules normandes. Ditch the wine and cook in cider, and enjoy moules bretonnes. Or throw in tomatoes and herbes de Provence (savory, marjoram, rosemary, thyme, oregano) for moules \u00e0 la proven\u00e7ale.\n\n\nFast food\n\nBelieve it or not fast food exists in France, and is often favoured by young French people on a budget. While you can certainly find examples of the major American chains, especially McDonald's (pronounced Mac Do informally) or the French chain Quick, the vast majority of fast-food establishments are in the form of the local kebab shop, not unlike those found in England. Almost all the dishes are roughly what you would expect, however a fast food shop is the least likely restaurant in which you'll find someone conversant in English.\n\nFrench Tacos (tacos \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise) \u2014 this particular food item demands a bit of explanation. While Mexican cuisine (or at least the international Tex-Mex variant) has become popular around Europe, it is a rare sight in France. So be aware the \"tacos\" that you see advertised at kebab shops in France are something else entirely, which in almost no way resembles Mexican or even Tex-Mex food, with the sole exception of the Durum wrapper, which resembles a large flour tortilla. To this is added kebab meat, fries, and one of a selection of cold mayonnaise-based sauces, and if you insist, some harissa. The whole thing is wrapped tight, like a burrito, and then flattened and seared in a hot panini press. The concoction has become hugely popular in the decade following its invention in the mid-2000s, and has expanded from its native Lyon region to the whole Francophonie, so it's probably incorrect to disparage le tacos \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise in and of itself. If you order such \"tacos\", be aware that you are getting one food item, not several, and thus there's obviously no mix-and-match. Real Mexican taquer\u00edas do exist in France and neighbouring countries, so don't be afraid to ask.\n\n\nVegetarianism\nVegetarianism is not as uncommon as it used to be, especially in larger cities, and vegetarians have become far better catered for than they used to be before the 2010s. While restaurants with at least one veggie option used to be the exception, they are starting to become the rule. Meanwhile more and more cartes feature at least one vegan (v\u00e9g\u00e9talien) item. Nonetheless, France still remains one of the more difficult and least inspiring places to be a vegetarian, and very few restaurants offer vegetarian menus, full vegetarian restaurants are rare (they are often found at place famous for alternative culture). Thus if you ask for something vegetarian, or if you ask for the undetailed \"vegetarian option\" in the menu, you will certainly have the vegetable side dishes that goes with the main course(s) being put together without any particular refinement (they often come at the same price as with meat). The only things most menus have available are salads. \nYour life will be made especially challenging if you don't eat cheese, which is absolutely ubiquitous in French cooking and will even often be added in foreign dishes where it shouldn't be (the most appalling and egregious example being supermarket hummus which, for reasons best known to French hummus manufacturers, usually has cottage cheese [fromage blanc] added to it). Attitudes towards vegetarianism are also not always very progressive; a temporary Covid-related decision by the local council in the city of Lyon to make school meals entirely pescetarian was met with huge backlash from farmers' unions and the French right in 2021.\nIn Paris, especially within the confines of the p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique ring road that separates the centre from its suburbs, you will have no trouble at all.  The 10th arrondissement in particular has a large array of speciality vegan and vegetarian restaurants. Outside Paris, the range of vegetarian food available does vary from region to region. Most regional capitals have vegetarian restaurants, but the most touristic a place is, the less options you will get.  \nIn Brittany, galettes (buckwheat pancakes) are a must - even if you think you don't like them from experience going to your local cr\u00eaperie, you will once you've had a real one in Brittany which tends to be a much more substantial meal than any galette you've had elsewhere - and your average galette/crepe place will usually have several vegetarian options available. Although they will traditionally contain an egg, most cr\u00eaperies allow you to select what you'd like to include in your galette. In Alsace, a number of regional specialities can be made vegetarian: the most common ones being Flammekueche/tarte flamb\u00e9e (Alsatian-style thin crust pizza) and tarte \u00e0 l'oignon (onion tart), but you might also occasionally come across vegetarian Spaetzle (baked egg pasta) or Roesti (potato pancakes). In alpine regions. Elsewhere, look out for ravioles (French-style ravioli, usually baked in a cheese gratin) which are usually (but not always, check with the waiter!) vegetarian, or gratin dauphinois (baked potatoes in cream sauce). In the South-East, ratatouille can also be a safe option.\nElsewhere however, local vegetarian specialities become more scarce and less interesting. Nonetheless, even in relatively small towns you have a number of options available to you if you're willing to forgo the local cuisine. A safe option is usually the local pizzeria, where you can obviously order a margherita if all else fails, but most pizza places will also offer a peculiarly French set of toppings called ch\u00e8vre-miel (honey and goat's cheese pizza). Kebab and tacos shops will very often offer either vegetarian tacos (of the French kind, not of the Tex-Mex kind you may be used to elsewhere!) or some sort of falafel wrap, although they aren't always the cleanest and most salubrious places and you shouldn't feel shy asking them to rinse or change their tongs (pinces in French) before serving you.\n\n\nBeverages\nFrance is one of the world's most prominent countries for wine (vin), and a comprehensive description of French wine would require an entire article in itself. Much beer is also drunk in France, especially the Flemish-influenced Nord region (eg. Pelforth, from Mons-en-Bar\u0153ul near Lille) and German-influenced Alsace (eg. Kronenbourg, from Strasbourg). Corsican chestnut beer (Pietra) can also be found in a lot of supermarkets around France. Beers sold in French supermarkets tend to be very strong Belgian-style beers, with alcohol content usually around 6\u20138%.\nWhile cider is not a staple alcoholic drink as it is in the UK, it is considered a regional delicacy in Brittany and Normandy and is often served either hot or cold in a bowl alongside crepes or galettes. In supermarkets it is usually sold in corked bottles as wine would be. It does however taste quite different to British ciders \u2013 usually you have the choice between cidre brut (hard cider), which has a somewhat unfamiliar smell and aftertaste, or cidre doux (sweet cider), which is indeed sweet, like apple juice from concentrate. \nFrance is also known for spirits distilled from wine. Famous drinks referred to as \"brandy\" by English-speakers include cognac and armagnac. France is also famed for its production of other distilled spirits such as calvados from apples and poire williams from pears, and for its almost limitless varieties of liqueurs. These drinks are collectively known in French as eaux-de-vie, literally \"waters of life\", but more commonly translated as spirits or liquors. The most well-known might be pastis, an aniseed-based spirit closely associated with the region around Marseille, or Chartreuse, a very strong herbal liqueur (usually around 60% ABV) from the mountains near Grenoble. In ski resorts you will commonly find Chartreuse served in hot chocolate to make a cocktail called green chaud.\nCoffee (caf\u00e9) is drunk at the end of a meal, occasionally with liquor. Excellent hot cocoa is also available, made from dark chocolate, and tea and herbal teas (called tisanes) are also often drunk. Linden (tilleul), verbena (vervain) and mint (menthe) are among the more popular herbal teas. In supermarkets you may also find chicory coffee (chicor\u00e9e) being sold, a result of WW2-era rationing that permanently caught on and is commonly associated with the (post-)industrial Nord region. While tea is not as popular as coffee in France, Parisian institution Mariage Fr\u00e8res is highly-revered among tea connoisseurs all around the world.\n\n\nSweets\nFrance is perhaps best known for the nougat, a type of confectionery made of eggs, sugar, and nuts, similar to Spanish turr\u00f3n or Italian torrone. The city of Mont\u00e9limar in the southeast of France is a well-known place for this.\nCr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a creamy vanilla custard with a hard and crunchy caramelized topping.\nFrench pastries (known overall as viennoiserie, a nod to Vienna, but in general quite different from Austrian-style pastries) are world-famous and available in almost limitless varieties. Among the fillings typically found in tartes (tarts, similar to small pies) sold by boulangeries, depending on the season, are apples, pears, peaches, rhubarb, lemons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, blueberries, almonds and chocolate. However, the most famous pastry is the croissant, which is best eaten in the morning, fresh and with still warm butter inside. Croissants are no sweeter than many types of breads and rolls. However, chocolate croissants, which are called pain au chocolat, and are also popular for breakfast. You may also enjoy a chausson aux pommes, which is often shaped like a 3-dimensional semicircle and filled with apple slices, though there is also a popular savory variety, chausson aux poivrons, which is filled with red bell peppers and onions. France is also the land of petits fours, very small pastries that come in many flavours, as is also true of macarons, such as those pictured on the pagebanner. If you have a sweet tooth, definitely don't miss a chance to visit boulangeries wherever you travel and try anything that seems interesting.\n\n\nSee also\nItalian cuisine",
