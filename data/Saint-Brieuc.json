M\u2013Sa 09:30\u201312:30 & 13:30\u201318:00, closed on Sunday, Dec 25, Jan 1st & May 1st; Summer: M\u2013Sa 10:00\u201313:00 & 14:00\u201319:00, Su 10:00\u201313:00. (updated Dec 2018)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\n1 Saint-Brieuc railway station, Place Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. M\u2013Sa 09:30\u201318:30, Su & bank holidays 13:00\u201319:45. By TGV from Paris Montparnasse. St Brieuc is on the TGV Ouest line between Paris and Brest. There are about 10 trains a day. In some cases, you may need to change trains in Rennes. The train ride takes about 3 hours.   (updated Dec 2018)\n\n\nBy car\nSt Brieuc is on the N12 expressway about 60 min from Rennes. Watch out for the speed cams on the bridges.\n\n\nBy boat\nYou can transit through Roscoff, 2 h by car to the west. or Saint-Malo, 90 min to the east. Brittany Ferries runs overnight car and passenger ferries from southern English ports of Portsmouth and Plymouth.\n\n\nBy plane\n2  Saint-Brieuc \u2013 Armor Airport (SBK  IATA), D706, 22440 Tr\u00e9muson (on N12 dual-carriageway, take the exit 35 \"A\u00e9roport D706\"; 7.5 km (4.7 mi) NW from Saint-Brieuc). The tiny airport no longer has any regular commercial flights.   (updated Dec 2018)\nRyanair flies from London Stansted and East Midlands to Dinard Pleurtuit Airport (DNR IATA) which is about 90 min to the east.\n\n\nGet around\nThe centre is compact and walkable. There is really no need to get a bus unless you are staying in the suburbs.\nThe local bus network (TUB) rserves the St Brieuc urban area. This is similar in scope to any equivalent sized French city. In the region a patchy network of buses exists (Bus D'Armor).\nThe service is very irregular.\n\n\nSee\nSaint Brieuc doesn't offer the same tourist draws as other historic towns in the area such as Dinan and Saint Malo.  However it's a great place to stroll around and observe a fairly typical working French town. It does have a lively arts scene. During the summer you can enjoy a lot of free music. Talent from all over France descends on the town. Summer music festivals such as les Nocturnes and L'Autour du Blues (at Binic) are big pulls.\nThe city is blessed with a series of valleys. Two rivers meet (Gouessant and Gouedic) here before they empty into the sea. Very scenic views on the approach to St Brieuc on the N12.\n\n\nDo\nShopping - Rue Marechal Foch.  All the regular French Chains can be found here.\nListening to Music- There are quite a few buskers playing folk and traditional Breton music in and around the Rue St Guillaume.\nLes Nocturnes - during the long summer evenings in July and August the local council lays on a musical extravaganza in various public locations throughout the town.  The emphasis is on traditional Breton, blues and world music.\nStrolling around - Exploring the Place Du Chai and admiring the architecture at the Place au Lin.  Sitting in the Place Du Chai enjoying a cafe au lait and watching the world go about its business.\nNearby - resorts of Binic and Le Val Andre are a must.  Very lively and bustling with young people. St Brieuc is like a support town for the Cote du Pentievre and the Cote du Goelo that draw people from all over France and Europe.\nArtrock is held in late May. The next is probably 24-26 May 2024, tbc.\n\n\nBuy\nYour usual Breton souvenirs.  St Brieuc is not full of tourist trinkets. (mercifully) It's more your regular French large town.  Most of the consumables you'd find in any town are available.\nCeltic art gift shops have sprung up in the past 5 years.  Cufflinks with triskell motifs make good presents. The Breton flag (Gwennadu) also looks mean on a T-shirt.\n\n\nEat\n Aux Pesked, 59 rue du legue. Recommended restaurant.  Great seafood but a little pricey.  It's a bit out of town. About 1 km north of the city centre. \n  Les Bains, 5 rue Saint-Fran\u00e7ois. A favourite Brasserie.  Really decent grub served in a fastidious Parisian manner.  Nice wine en carafe and wide selection of daily lunch specials. \n\n\nDrink\nAny of the places on Place du Chay.  The most lively place in St Brieuc.\n\n\nSleep\nThere's Youth Hostel about 2.5 km out of town (Manoir de la ville guyomard).\nIf that doesn't float your boat there are numerous 2 star hotels in the immediate city centre.\nOut of town at Langueux (new commercial development 2 klicks east of town on the N12). There are the regular French motel type chains.  Formule 1 and Ibis (Yffiniac) are represented there.\n\n\nGo next\nSea and Sun await at the nearby - Cote du Goelo (to the northwest) and Cote du Penthievre (to the East)\nVisit Erquy the capital of the Coquille St Jacques and the breathtaking Cap D'Erquy.  This beauty sport is where the author of the Asterix comics drew inspiration for the valiant Gaul's home village.",
