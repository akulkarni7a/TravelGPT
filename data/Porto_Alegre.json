  "extract": "Porto Alegre is the capital city and the most populous city of the state Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. With 4.4 million people in its metropolitan area (2020), it is the 4th largest city of the country. The city is not known for its tourist attractions, although it is a frequently used entry point to the Serras Ga\u00fachas region, a major domestic tourism destination.\n\n\nDistricts\n\n\nUnderstand\nPorto Alegre is the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul and the biggest urban agglomeration of Southern Brazil. Situated geographically and culturally midway between S\u00e3o Paulo and Buenos Aires, Porto Alegre developed its distinct flavor of Portuguese heritage under the influence of other European immigrants and a variety of other ethnic groups. It is one of the richest cities in the country, the state capital with the highest life quality and literacy rate (97%), and the book capital of Brazil. However, Porto Alegre still suffers from many problems that affect big Brazilian cities, such as poverty of part of the population, lack of adequate housing, high cost of living, pollution, violence and traffic jams.\nGa\u00fachos, as natives of Rio Grande do Sul state are known, are very proud of their land and culture. In 1835, Ragamuffin War, a separatist uprising which declared Rio Grande do Sul independent from Brazil broke out. This war wreaked havoc across the entire state during 10 bloody years, killing nearly 20% of Ga\u00fachos and ultimately leading to a peace treaty where the Riograndense Republic once again became part of Brazil.\nAnother major Brazilian revolution also began in Rio Grande do Sul. The Federalist Revolution of 1893 defended the decentralization of powers and greater autonomy for the states, and only finished in 1895, after spreading to two other states. It was also in Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Alegre) where the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 which overthrew the president Washington Luis began, and so was from Rio Grande do Sul the most important Brazilian communist revolutionary of all times: Luis Carlos Prestes, who led the nation-wide communist upheaval in 1935. For such reasons, among many others, Ga\u00fachos are particularly proud of their mother state, many considering themselves different from other Brazilians.\nPorto Alegre is now a service-centered city in between the industrial part of the state (north-east) and the rural part (south). Today, is also called the Mercosur Capital.\n\n\nClimate\n\nDue to its low altitude and southern location, Porto Alegre has a very variable humid subtropical climate, but is known for its well-defined seasons. Summer is generally hot and humid and the winter is cool. During summer, it is common for the humidity to get high, giving a feeling of muffling. However, the summer in Porto Alegre tends to be less rainy than in other Brazilian cities, like S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro. In winter, sometimes it is possible to have frost. \nPorto Alegre has a wide range of temperatures. Depending on the neighborhood in which you are in Porto Alegre, humidity can cause temperatures to vary a few degrees above or below. In the winter months, temperatures vary from cold to mild. The average temperature throughout the days are usually 15 \u00baC (59 \u00baF) and the nights tends to have an average of 10\u00ba C (50 \u00baF), although it is not uncommon for some years where there may be days in the winter with temperatures up to 30 \u00baC (86 \u00baF). This phenomenon is locally called \"veranico\" (Indian summer). In some years, winter temperatures can also be freezing, reaching close to 0\u00ba C (32 \u00baF). Unlike the cities located in the Serra Ga\u00fachas region, where there is the highest altitude, in Porto Alegre rarely snows. The last time this phenomenon occurred was in 1984.\nThe summer in Porto Alegre is hot and humid. Temperatures can be very high and oppressive, sometimes reaching around 40 \u00baC (104 \u00baF), leading the city to earn the nickname \"Forno Alegre\" (Forno is the Portuguese word for \"oven\"). However, these high temperatures can be interrupted by cold fronts that bring rain for a few days, bringing a welcome relief from the high temperatures. Rainfall are evenly distributed throughout the year. There is not a completely dry month, although there may be less rain from March to May. Afternoon thunderstorms in the spring and summer are common, so it is recommended to bring an umbrella to protect of the rain. \nRegardless of the time of year, Porto Alegre is a very sunny city during the year, so it is recommended to use sunscreen.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Salgado Filho International Airport (POA  IATA) (4.3 miles (7 km) from downtown). Porto Alegre International Airport is the main airport in Rio Grande do Sul and one of the most important in southern Brazil, with modern facilities and a shopping-like structure with shops and restaurants. It is among the ten busiest airports in Brazil. Improvements are being made in its passenger terminal, including the expansion of its airstrip. Flights come from cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Bras\u00edlia, Curitiba, Florian\u00f3polis, Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Montevideo, C\u00f3rdoba, Rosario, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, Panama City, Lisbon. Porto Alegre also has direct flights to Sal, in Cape Verde. It's served by all major Brazilian airlines (Azul, LATAM, Gol) and international airlines (TAP Portugal, Copa Airlines, Avianca Airlines, Cabo Verde Airlines and Aerolineas Argentinas).   (updated Feb 2020)\nThere is a train station (known as trensurb by locals) and bus stops near the airport. A people mover (aerom\u00f3vel) connects the train station with the airport terminal.\n\n\nBy train\n\nA commuter train service known as Trensurb, serve only the metropolitan area, with one line connecting Historic Distric to some cities in the Greater Porto Alegre such as Canoas, Esteio, Sapucaia do Sul, S\u00e3o Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo. The fare is R$4.50 and there's a station near Rodovi\u00e1ria (Central Bus Station) and the airport. It is more or less safe to walk during day time from Rodovi\u00e1ria or the airport to the stations. An automated people-mover (Aerom\u00f3vel) connects the first floor of the terminal to the local train station.\n\n\nBy car\nComing from the North (Florian\u00f3polis, Curitiba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro), one may reach Porto Alegre by two ways. BR-116 is shorter, but much more dangerous. This road is used to reach other destinations in Rio Grande do Sul, such as Caxias do Sul, Gramado and Canela. BR-116 also connects all major metropolitan cities and traffic jams are frequent during rush hours in weekdays. One way to escape traffic jams during peak hours is BR-448, which links Porto Alegre to Sapucaia do Sul in the metropolitan area. The other way to get to Porto Alegre from the North is using BR-101 to Os\u00f3rio and then BR-290. The first connects Curitiba, Florian\u00f3polis and Os\u00f3rio, and is being upgraded to highway standards; the latter crosses Rio Grande do Sul from Os\u00f3rio to Uruguaiana, through Porto Alegre. The section between Os\u00f3rio and Porto Alegre is called free-way by locals, and is a very well-maintained 6-lane toll-road.\nAlso, in neighboring Canoas, BR-386 begins, connecting the metropolitan area with other major cities in the countryside, such as Santa Cruz do Sul, Santa Maria and Passo Fundo. It has 4 lanes up to Taba\u00ed and it is in decent conditions.\nFrom the South, coming from cities such as Pelotas, Rio Grande, and Chu\u00ed, one would use BR-116.\nFrom the East, Porto Alegre is reachable by BR-290 from Uruguaiana and Argentina. Using this road, it's possible to reach southern cities such as Bag\u00e9 and Santana do Livramento. This section of BR-290 shares a stretch with BR-116, from Gua\u00edba's Bridge up to Eldorado do Sul interchange.\nSome of these roads are dangerous due to their poor signalling/conditions and lots of trucks. Most of them are toll-roads and have electronic speed traps. Schedule your travels by car during the day; it is simply safer. Another important point is that the Gua\u00edba Bridge, in the BR-290, which crosses Lake Gua\u00edba, is a movable bridge that may have its transit interrupted for lifting its movable span to give passage to large ships. It is important to be aware of the lift schedules so as not to be taken by surprise. They are available on the CCR Via Sul website (in Portuguese), the company responsible for the bridge.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nThe long distance bus station is located in the downtown and offers state, national and international lines. Daily services connects Porto Alegre with several cities inside the country and also Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay. It is also connected to a Trensurb station and several municipal bus lines.\n\n2 Porto Alegre Bus Terminal (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Rodovi\u00e1ria de Porto Alegre), Largo Vespasiano J\u00falio Veppo, 70 (Rodovi\u00e1ria Trensub Station next to the entrance), \u260f +55 51 3210-0101.  (updated Apr 2021)\n\n\nBy boat\nBesides its decent port facilities for cargo, a commuter catamaran service connects downtown and Barra Shopping Sul to Gua\u00edba, a neighbour city situated on the other side of Gua\u00edba Lake. The crossing takes 20 minutes and costs R$ 7,35 each way. Checking the schedule beforehand is recommended.\n\n\nGet around\nThe city is roughly a semi-circle that expanded outward in a concentric manner, beginning from the Historic District, right next to the promontory and the harbor. Avenues going from the center to the outer areas of the semi-circle are the radiais (radials) and are crossed by avenues named perimetrais (perimeters). Hence, to go to and from downtown one will use mostly the former, whereas to go from one neighborhood to another, one uses the latter.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nTo understand the bus system, one must consider the above description. All lines are identified as \"(prefix)-number name/neighborhood\". Almost all lines are radial, that is, they connect an outer neighborhood to the various downtown terminals. Those lines have no prefix. It is quite common to switch buses at downtown but, considering there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal to hop on the next bus. Transversal lines (prefix \"T\" - T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different neighborhood without going through the downtown area, effectively eliminating the need of changing buses for the most common trips. Circular lines (prefix \"C\" - C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting parts of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods.\nThe Porto Alegre city bus system is operated by the public company Carris and by four consortiums of private companies. With the exception of Carris, which has lines connecting all regions of Porto Alegre, almost all lines of each consortium connects the Historic District to a different zone of Porto Alegre. Buses can have different colors depending on the region they serve:\n\nCarris serves all areas of Porto Alegre (mainly through the Transversal lines - identified by the prefix \"T\", i.e. T1, T2...) and its buses are ocher in color.\nVia Leste and Cons\u00f3rcio Mais has its buses in green. The lines connect the Historic District to the East and Southeast Zones of the city, respectively.\nMob has its buses in blue. The lines connect the Historic District to the North Zone and Islands of the city.\nViva Sul has its buses in red. The lines connect the Historic District to the South Zone.\nThe PoaTransporte website provides a map with all the stops nearby and the buses that pass through them, in addition to the route that each bus line takes. Together with Google Maps this can give you a clue.\nIt is very hard to find bus stops with indication of lines' destinations or timetables. Hence, when in doubt, the easiest way is to ask the locals which bus will get you to you destination. Porto Alegre's buses are, in most cases, clean, safe and fast, specially when the line uses the bus corridor, a reserved lane with special stops in main avenues, effectively avoiding traffic jams. However, Porto Alegre buses can get crowded and accommodate only standing passengers during peak hours, in the early morning and late afternoon. In order to use the bus, you must be at a bus stop and signal or wave your hand to the arriving bus you want to ride (they will not stop unless waved upon!).\nThe fare must be paid to the bus ticket reviser before crossing the turnstile located inside the bus. Fares may be paid either in cash or using a smartcard system named TRI. TRI-users get discounts in consecutive trips - a 50 percent discount is granted to the second trip within half an hour. Fares are listed below:\n\n\nBy lota\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nThe Lota\u00e7\u00e3o is an alternative transportation system, with fewer lines, served by minibuses with up to 20 people in capacity. All minibuses are air conditioned and some of them have reclining seats. Unlike buses, Lota\u00e7\u00f5es do not travel on the bus lanes and you can get on and off at any point (that is, outside the designated stops) of the trip. The fare is R$ 8. The minibuses are easily recognized by their \"red, white and blue\" color. If you're not sure if a Lota\u00e7\u00e3o goes to the destination you want to go, just wave your hand, wait until it stops and from the street ask the driver if it goes to your destination (for instance to go to Iguatemi Mall just say Iguatemi?), don't go in just to ask otherwise the driver might ask you to pay the fare since the counter is measured on the stairs near the door.\n\n\nBy taxi\n\nThere are plenty of taxis. They can be pricey, if compared to other towns, but they are also an easier, safer and more dependable option than buses in some cases. To ride a cab, one can walk to the nearest \"taxi stop\" (usually in crowded areas or points of interest), wave for an empty passing cab or call a tele-t\u00e1xi service. Tele-t\u00e1xi may charge extra for this service. The price of the fare is determined by a machine called tax\u00edmetro, usually in front of the passenger seat. There is always a minimum price, which is shown when the machine is reset for the trip, which is, as of 2011, R$3.50. Next to the value, there is a \"flag\" indicator that shows the level of price being paid, always according to the service. Usually there is a table inside of the cab explaining each level of service. It is recommended to check if the correct level is being charged at the beginning of the trip, in order to avoid problems when you reach your destination.\n\n\nBy car\nAlthough Porto Alegre's public transport system is of good quality, renting a car can be a good option if you are traveling with a partner or prefer to explore places further away from the city. There are numerous car rental companies in Porto Alegre, the majors being Localiza, Movida and Unidas. Vehicle prices, rental periods, vehicle pick-up and drop-off locations, and reservations can be made easily and well in advance on the internet.\nIt is important to note that traffic in Porto Alegre tends to be slow and congested at peak times, in the early morning and late afternoon/early evening, especially on large avenues such as Avenida Zaida Jarros, which connects the airport to BR- 290, Avenida Assis Brasil and Avenida Farrapos, in the North Zone and Avenida Ipiranga and Avenida Bento Gon\u00e7alves, in the Southeast Zone. Parking can also be difficult to find in Porto Alegre, especially in the Historic District.\n\n\nOn foot\nWalking around is a reasonable idea only inside a given neighborhood or downtown, as opposed to from one neighborhood to another, as they are usually too far apart. Walking during the night in most parts of the city is outright dangerous. During the day, it is recommended to pay attention to your belongings at all times, due to activity of pickpockets and other thieves. Pedestrian crossings, most of the time, are completely ignored by the vast majority of drivers; never rely on them without looking or making sure the driver will stop. It is also not recommended to cross the street outside the proper crossing areas in traffic jams: motorbike riders usually split between stopped cars, causing a great risk to pedestrians.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nThe main e-hailing platforms in Porto Alegre are Uber and 99. Both offer cheaper rides than taxis and are very popular with locals in Porto Alegre.\n\n\nSee\nLinha Turismo is a tourist bus line that rides through 11 neighbourhoods and shows the main attractions of the city (parks, trees, statues, hospitals, churches, etc.), with audio guides in three languages. The trip is 28 km (17 mi) long and lasts for about 1 hr 20 min, and the arrival is at the same departure address.

Occasionally, some more secluded spots may be temporarily suitable for bathing. Since 2021, the city's Water and Sewerage Department (DMAE) regularly publishes a bathing report (in Portuguese, relat\u00f3rio de balneabilidade).\n\n\nCope\nIn Porto Alegre, the electric power voltage is 127 V, unlike the rest of the cities in Rio Grande do Sul, where the voltage is 220 V. It is common for electrical equipment sold in Porto Alegre to be bi-volt, however, always check carefully.\nIf you need immediate help, the emergency numbers are 190 for police, 192 for paramedics or 193 for firefighters.\n\nPorto Alegre Prefecture website (in Portuguese)\n\n\nConsulates\n  Argentina, Rua Coronel Bordini, 1033 - Moinhos de Vento, \u260f +55 51 3321-1360, fax: +55 51 3321-1360,  +55 51 99959-0061, caleg@mrecic.gob.ar.
