  "extract": "With 1.6 million people in its urban area (2019), Marseille (Proven\u00e7al: Marselha) is the second most populated city of France (and third urban area) the biggest Mediterranean port and the economic center of the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region. In 2013 the city (with its region) was the European Capital of Culture, a large series of cultural events took place, and several new infrastructures were inaugurated.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nMarseille has a complex history. It was founded by the Phoceans (from the Greek city of Phocea) in 600 BC and is one of the oldest cities in Europe. The town is a far cry from the C\u00e9zanne paintings and Proven\u00e7al clich\u00e9s of sleepy villages, \"p\u00e9tanque\" players and Marcel Pagnol novels. With around one million inhabitants, Marseille is the second largest city in France in terms of population and the largest in terms of area. Its population is a real melting pot of different cultures. It is also said that there are more Comorian people in Marseille than in Comoros! Indeed, the people of Marseille have varying ethnic backgrounds, with a lot of Italians and Spaniards having immigrated to the area after the Second World War.\nFor people not afraid to discover a real place with real people, Marseille is the place. From colourful markets (like Noailles market) that will make you feel like you are in Africa, to the Calanques (a natural area of big cliffs falling into the sea - Calanque means fjord), from the Panier area (the oldest place of the town and historically the place where newcomers installed) to the Vieux-Port (old harbor) and the Corniche (a road along the sea) Marseille has definitely a lot to offer.\nForget the Canebi\u00e8re, forget the \"savon de Marseille\" (Marseille soap), forget the clich\u00e9s, and just have a ride from l'Estaque to Les Goudes. You will not forget it.\n\n1 Office de Tourisme et des Congr\u00e8s de Marseille (Main Tourist Office), 11, la Canebi\u00e8re, \u260f +33 826 500 500, information@marseille-tourisme.com. M-Sa 09:00 - 07:00, Su and holidays 10:00 - 05:00. (updated May 2015)\n\n\nClimate\n\nThe city experiences a Mediterranean climate with cool winters and hot summers. Winters are cooler and windier than in other areas of the French Riviera, but also sunnier (sunshine hours are among the highest in Europe). Spring, on the other hand, features a much faster warm-up than in nearby Nice. Autumn experiences variable temperatures and is generally the cloudiest season of the year. Summers are hot and dry, but the sea breeze moderates the heat and makes it more comfortable.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Marseille-Provence International Airport (MRS  IATA) (about 30 km from Marseille).   \nGetting to the airport:\n\nBus. Bus #91 is the easiest way to get to Marseille's city centre. The shuttle leaves approximately every 15-20 minutes, taking 25 minutes and goes directly to the St. Charles bus/train station where you can take the metro or walk to your hotel. The price is \u20ac10 for a one-way or \u20ac16 for a round-trip (as of May 2022). Buses go to some other directions too.\nTrain. The airport is served by the Vitrolles Marseille Provence Airport train station on the TER network. This train station can be reached in 5 min by bus #13, departing from bus station's platform 5. This TER line serves Marseille and Miramas in one direction, and Arles, Tarascon, N\u00eemes and Montpellier in the other.\nTaxi. The airport website indicates the price of \u20ac50 for a trip to Marseille during the day and \u20ac60 at night.\n\n\nBy train\nMarseille sees TGV trains from Paris (3 hours) via Lyon (1hr 45min), Nice (2.5 hours) and from Brussels (5 hours). Slower Intercit\u00e9s trains connects with cities not on the TGV network. All trains within France are run by SNCF or for low-cost TGV by Ouigo. Additionally, Eurostar has previously offered an all year round direct service from London (6\u00bd hours); they were discontinued in 2020, and there is no indication (Oct 2022) that they will resume.   \nFor travel from Spain, there are daily AVE service operated by a joint venture of the French and Spanish railway companies from Barcelona (4\u00bd hours), and Madrid (8 hours). Alternatively, there are frequent connections to Cerb\u00e8re and onwards to Barcelona by means of a series of regional trains. \nRegional TER are frequent and connects with several nearby cities and can be a cheaper alternative then using TGV trains for shorter journeys.\n\n2 Marseille-Saint-Charles station (Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles), 1 Sq. Narvik (s short walk from the Canebi\u00e8re and the Old Port, but the station is slightly uphill which might be inconvenient if you have heavy luggage). Open 04:30-01:00. The main station of Marseille, built in 1927.   (updated Jun 2023)\n\n\nBy bus\nNice \u2013 Buses leave from Nice Gare SNCF at 05:22, 06:23, 08:13, 11:23, 14:23, 15:12, 16:23, 17:40, 18:13, and 19:13, often daily. They take about 3 hr and cost \u20ac33. There are additional direct connections from Nice Care Routi\u00e8re Vauban and Nice airport via Aix-en-Provence. See https://zou.maregionsud.fr/ .\nFlixBus has many connections all over Europe.\n\n Gare Routi\u00e8re St Charles (bus station) (next to the main train station St. Charles; access through Platform N), \u260f +33 4 91 08 16 40, standardGRM@rtm.fr. M Tu Th F 07:30-19:00; W Sa Su holidays: 08:00 - 13:00, 14:00 - 19:00. (updated May 2015)\n\n\nBy car\nMarseille is very well connected to most French cities through numerous highways. As always in France those highways are expensive but practical, comfortable and fast. Marseille is around 8 hours from Paris by car, 2 hours from Nice, 1 hr 30 min from Montpellier, 4 hours from Toulouse and 3 hours from Lyon.  However, be aware that driving in the city centre is a nightmare - park your car somewhere safe and stick to public transport whenever you can.\n\n\nBy boat\nMarseille has a big harbour. There are direct daily services to Marseille from Ajaccio, Bastia, Porto Torres, Porto-Vecchio, and Propriano as well as ferries traversing the Mediterranean from Oran and Algiers in Algeria, usually with one or two crossings per week.\nThere are several piers at the harbour, so it is advisable to check well in advance from which pier you are departing.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nIf traveling by bicycle, you should arrive early in the day to avoid getting lost in this vast metropolis. Maps from the tourist office focus on the city center, so you should come with your own map to navigate the suburbs.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus, tram, m\u00e9tro\nMarseille is served by a transit system, the R\u00e9gie des Transports de Marseille (RTM) comprising 2 m\u00e9tro (subway) lines, 3 tram lines and 74 bus lines. Almost every m\u00e9tro station has steps in it somewhere and some will have several flights of stairs. If you have any mobility problems, are in a wheelchair or have a child in a push chair, the trams and buses are a better option.\nThe tickets for bus, tram and m\u00e9tro can be bought in the cafes, at the m\u00e9tro stations, or on the bus; it is advised to buy a 10-journey ticket at \u20ac15 (+ 10 cents for the reusable card), which are not sold in the buses. The number of transfers is unlimited (including the return journeys) within the one-hour limit between the first boarding and last transfer on all the network (you must validate with each entry to the bus). The m\u00e9tro runs between 05:00 and 00:30. The tram system operates until 00:30 7 days a week. Most bus routes do not operate after 21:00 or so, although a limited network of night buses (Fluobus) operates with infrequent service (only about every 45\u201360 minutes or so) until about 00:30 or so. Using a taxi is recommended if you need to travel after 21:00. There is no service at all on 1 May.\nThe Pilote website, includes all the bus, tram and m\u00e9tro schedules but is easier to read than the RTM sites. Moreover, this site repeats the schedules of the majority of transport in common runs of the agglomeration (tram, bus interurban, trains regional) and makes it possible to search for journeys in Marseille and the nearby communes.\nThere is a useful RTM app for both Android and iPhone providing journey planning & timetable info. It is reasonably obvious to use even if you don't speak French.\nAirport transfers are available by bus for \u20ac8.30 each way to/from Gare St Charles.  Tickets may be bought at the cabin between Hall 1 and Hall 3/4 of the main terminal and at a separate kiosk in the new Gare Routi\u00e8re, after Voie N in the Gare St Charles.  The bus runs every 20 minutes on 10, 30, and 50 minutes past the hour. The ride is about 30 minutes.  The bus says Navette Aeroport Gare St Charles on it. From Gare St Charles, the metro can get you to most hotels. A cheaper (\u20ac5.70) way to get to Marseille, Gare St Charles is by TER train, there are free shuttle buses to the railway station, the train part of the journey is about 20 minutes.\nSingle tickets allow unlimited transfers onto bus or tram within 1 hour of initial use for the \u20ac1.70 fare and one entry (1-hour limit) to the metro. A daily ticket (carte journ\u00e9e) costs \u20ac5.20 or 72 hours for \u20ac10.80. If you are staying longer there is 7-day pass \u20ac15.50 but this requires a \"La Carte\" personalised transport card which is free but you will require a passport sized photo & photo ID. It can be obtained from a RTM customer reception like the one in St Charles. La Carte can also be loaded with euros and be used on a pay as you go basis where a single ticket cost is \u20ac1.40. \nLike most large cities, there is a city pass that include entrance to various attractions. Check whether they meet your needs before purchase; as starting at \u20ac27 (adult) for 24 hours, they are an expensive option for transport alone.\n\n\nBy boat\nA Ferry Boat crosses the Old Harbour (Vieux Port). It is a tourist attraction in itself known as the shortest commercial boat ride in Europe. Several other ferries propose connections with L'Estaque, Les Goudes, La Pointe-Rouge and Le Frioul. They cost \u20ac10 return trip but a 1-week RTM transportation pass (\u20ac14.50; passport and color photo needed) comprises them (except Frioul island) which is very interesting. Also there are several companies proposing boat tours of the Calanque, like mini-cruises.\n\n\nBy car\nAvoid taking your car if you possibly can. Marseille, at least the centre, has narrow streets, one-way streets, random lane changes and so on which can drive both locals and non-locals crazy. The local drivers have a well deserved reputation for fearlessness - particularly if they are on two wheels.  In addition, Marseille has some of the lowest parking fines in France - parking fines are rarely enforced and consequently you will find cars parked (and sometimes double parked) everywhere.\nDue to the new tunnel that is being built to try to alleviate some of Marseille's traffic problems, satellite navigational systems such as the Tom Tom are likely to be out of date and dangerous if followed. For instance, following a Tom Tom in the centre of Marseille could take you across newly installed pedestrian areas or Tram lines. The one-way system has also completely changed.\n\n\nBy taxi\nBe careful of rogue taxi drivers. While there aren't many, there are a few and a \u20ac20 ride can quickly become a \u20ac40 ride.  If you think you've been cheated get the taxi driver's number (in the rear of the car, often on the window) and go to the Tourist's Office at 11, La Canebi\u00e8re (near Le Vieux Port) and speak to a representative, they can and will get your money back if you've been ripped off.  They will also get the taxi driver in significant trouble.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nMarseille has the excellent le v\u00e9lo cycle hire scheme in place (but a very small number of cycle paths), this makes it possible to get round the city quickly and very reasonably. It costs \u20ac1 for a week's subscription. Each time you hire a bike, the first 30 minutes are free, then each hour costs \u20ac1. There is a \u20ac150 deposit which will be charged if you don't return the bike properly.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Vieux Port (old harbour) (Vieux-Port   M1 ). Watching fishermen selling their stock by auction is a must. Arriving into Marseille in the Vieux-Port on a summer evening is something you will never forget. You can watch this show by going to Frioul islands or Chateau d'If and going back late in the afternoon. There is also a nice view on the harbour from the Palais du Pharo (Pharo Palace). The famous Canebi\u00e8re avenue goes straight down the harbour. However the Canebi\u00e8re is not that interesting despite its reputation.   (updated May 2015)\n2 Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde, Rue Fort du Sanctuaire (Bus #60 goes from the Vieux Port to N-D de La Garde. Free Parking at the entrance of the church.). 07:00 - 18:15 in winter, 07:00 - 19:15 in summer. The big church which overlooks the city. Old fishermen used to have their boats blessed in this church. You can still see many boat models hanging around in the church. From there it is one of the nicest view of the city. You can use the tourist train from the Vieux Port to reach the church - you can get off the train, look around and board a later train back to the port.

Marseille City Hall   (updated May 2015)\n5 Le Panier (Marseille\u2019s old town) (the old town can be easily accessed from the Vieux Port. It is not recommended to drive there). Le Panier (which means basket in French) is the historical centre of the city. This district is characterized by many narrow and steep streets. The tourist office organises a guided tour in English of the Old town every Saturday at 14:00. You can begin your tour from the Vieux-Port and finish at the Mucem or vice versa. A recommended trail of this district is also proposed by the tourist office.

La Plaine is the local name for Place Jean Jaur\u00e8s close to Cours Julien. Every Thursday and Saturday morning the Plaine market is the place to shop. If you are there early enough you can make very good deals, even if what you'll find there is sometimes \"tomb\u00e9 du camion\" (fallen off the truck) as one says in Marseille.   (updated May 2015)\n12 Noailles quarter (Noailles  M2 Noailles  T1 ). Lined with Arabic and Indo-Chinese shops some of the streets could be part of a bazzaar in Algeria. A fascinating area.  (updated Jul 2023)\n13 Palais Longchamp (Cinq Avenues Longchamp  M1 ; Longchamp  T2 ). It houses the city's Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts and Natural History Museum.

Its two flag-bearing specialities being the famous fish broth \"bouillabaisse\" and \"a\u00efoli\", a garlic sauce served with vegetables and dried cod.\n\n\nLa Bouillabaisse de Marseille\nLa bouillabaisse is an excellent fish-based soup served with la rouille (a garlic-saffron sauce) and bread similar to crostini. In fact, Bouillabaisse is a 2-course meal: first you get soup from the pot, then you get the rest, i.e. fish.\nLa bouillabaisse cannot be enjoyed on the cheap. If you are invited to the home of someone making bouillabaisse, then you are in the clear. But never eat cheap bouillabaisse at a restaurant unless it's not called bouillabaisse; only eat it at a place where you have to reserve in advance.\n\n\nBudget\nThere are lots of Kebab restaurants along the Canebi\u00e8re.

Wifi is widely available in public places, transport, cafes and so on.\n\n\nStay safe\nFor much of its history, and still to this day, Marseille has been seen as a crime-ridden city by a lot of French people, and this reputation is sadly not entirely unwarranted. Nevertheless, tourists will have a great time by taking the basic precautions, and the city center is very safe. As a very broad rule of thumb, any area within a 15/20-minute walk of the Old Port is safe.\nHowever, muggings and pickpockets have dramatically increased, so do avoid carrying valuables and watch your surroundings, like in most cities. Most of the northern neighbourhoods (quartiers nord), with the very notable exceptions of L'Estaque and Ch\u00e2teau-Gombert, are among the most dangerous in France outside the Paris area, and should be avoided by tourists. Thankfully, there is no reason for going there.\nFurthermore, Marseille is one of the few cities in France to still have prevalent Mafias and gangs.\nThe area around Boulevard Michelet teems with prostitutes and should be avoided on soccer nights, as you can meet potentially angry and drunk Olympique de Marseille hooligans. Marseille is one of Europe's premier football cities, and local fans will not take too kindly to those who dare wear a visiting team's jersey, especially Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nHouses of worship\nChristian\n\n Notre-Dame de la Garde, Rue Fort du Sanctuaire, \u260f +33 4 91 13 40 80. \n Eglise r\u00e9form\u00e9e de Grignan Centre Sud, 15 Rue Grignan, \u260f +33 4 91 33 17 10. \n Eglise R\u00e9form\u00e9e de France, 103 La Canebi\u00e8re, \u260f +33 4 91 17 06 40. \n Eglise Arm\u00e9nienne, 339 Avenue Prado, \u260f +33 4 91 77 84 70. \n Eglise Ev Baptiste Paix Aujourd'hui, 95 Boulevard de Strasbourg, \u260f +33 4 91 64 08 09. \n Eglise Biblique Baptiste de Marseille, 72 Boulevard Plombi\u00e8res, \u260f +33 6 81 84 55 69. \n Eglise Chr\u00e9tienne de R\u00e9veil, 4 Place S\u00e9bastopol, \u260f +33 4 91 34 35 63. \nJewish\n\n Consistoire Isra\u00eblite de Marseille, 117 Rue Breteuil, \u260f +33 4 91 37 49 64. \n   Centre Communautaire Isra\u00e9lite, 184 Avenue Lazare Carnot, \u260f +33 4 94 92 61 05. \n\n\nConsulates\n  China, 20 Boulevard Carmagnole, \u260f +33 4-91-32-00-00, fax: +33 4-91-32-00-08. \n  Indonesia, 25 Boulevard Carmagnole, \u260f +33 491 230160, fax: +33 491 714032, marseille.kjri@kemlu.go.id.
