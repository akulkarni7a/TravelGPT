  "extract": "Sleep, and thus accommodation, is a basic need for travellers. It typically requires more planning and money than other parts of the journey. Without a good night's sleep you won't be at 100% the next day which can ruin your trip. \n\n\nFinding accommodation\n\nAccommodation can either be booked in advance, or found on the day. If the itinerary is set, booking as soon as possible is usually the best option.\n\n\nBooking in advance\nBooking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind that they will have somewhere to sleep once they arrive at their destination.\n\nOver the Internet\nThrough a travel agent\nOver the telephone\nHowever, hotel managers have to fill beds so it's not uncommon for travellers having booked a room, particularly at the lower end of the cost scale, to arrive to find that it has been resold. This is because hotels usually have a policy of overbooking (selling more reservations than they have rooms available), especially on high-demand nights, with the assumption that some guests will cancel or no-show. (As some hotels abuse this more than others, it pays to check online reviews before booking anything.)\nIf a guest has to be \"walked\" (told that there are no rooms available despite having a reservation), the hotel will usually offer to pay for a night's accommodation at another nearby hotel \u2014 but if there is especially high demand for rooms throughout the whole area, even this may not be possible. Managers who overbook hotel rooms have been known to play favourites, with the lone voyager staying \"just one night\" as a first-and-only time visitor to the city taking lowest priority, along with clients of third-party reseller websites and any travellers the desk staff perceive to be \"impolite\" or \"rude\". Turning away a loyal client who visits often, such as a business traveller or a convention vendor, would mean the inn losing that client's future business. To reduce your chances of being walked, try to arrive at the hotel as soon as possible after check-in time begins.\nCheck carefully what you are booking. Search results often include offers even tens of kilometres from the location searched for. Marketers are infamous for touting accommodation as being \"close to\" attractions which are far away, sometimes even in the next city. Wikivoyage articles often provide coordinates and a locator map to give an idea of the relative proximity of lodging to key attractions; at minimum, a street address should be mentioned.\nBeware of hidden charges, such as a non-optional \"resort fee\" or \"destination marketing fee\"; the hotel may have no intention of making any room available at the advertised price. Ask for the full cost before you book anything. If a hotel refuses to rent a room without a credit card, which happens frequently but not universally, they may be planning to bill all manner of \"incidental fees\" or hidden charges to your card. It sometimes pays to read the fine print.\nThanks to crowd-sharing sites, travelers have many more options. \n\n\nOn-line\nYou can book accommodation on-line, either at the hotel's own web site or at the website of an agency. Depending upon where you are going, this can be extremely useful. Yet if you are travelling to somewhere a bit more out of the way, for example, a small city or town, you may find something, but there will be accommodation options not listed on the internet. In this situation, it is better to find accommodation \"on the day\", as described below.\nMetasearch websites aggregate results from numerous providers (Online Travel Agencies - OTA, Vacation Rental Marketplace, Booking Engines) that allow users to price compare. Metasearch is very useful in gaining an overview of the accommodations market of a given destination and to price compare the different properties.\nSometimes, a hotel has its own web site but doesn't publish the dates for which it still has vacancies. Completing a \"Contact us\" form or sending an email should obtain every detail you need.\nOn-line reservation is increasingly becoming the most common way of booking accommodation (sometimes the only way); unfortunately the downside is that a credit card is required to complete the reservation \u2013 so you will be out of luck if you don't have one (sometimes getting a debit or pre-paid VISA/MasterCard may work). Moreover, you will need to check the rate being offered if payment is needed immediately or upon arrival/departure. Discounted rates usually require that payment be made immediately, but regular rates will allow you to pay upon arrival or check-out at the property. In the case of the latter, you do not need to settle payment with the same credit card used for making the reservation; you can pay using cash in many establishments. However, you may still be required to present the credit card used for making the reservation (especially for pre-paid/advance purchase bookings to reduce card fraud).\nOne hazard of online bookings that are not directly through a hotel's website is that the reservations are sometimes lost in online transit between the booking site and the hotel, so consider calling the hotel directly to see whether they will match the rate you saw online, and if not, you might want to call them in advance to confirm that they got the correct information from the booking site. Also, consider the costs of required taxes and fees when comparing room prices, as the same price may be represented differently, depending on whether taxes and fees are included in the price that's shown or simply charged later. As well, when using an aggregator, keep in mind the hotel is making less money on your room than on those booked directly through them (hotels sell rooms at a steep discount to the aggregator, who then increases the price to the end user back up to the rack rate and profits on the difference). This often translates to poorer service from hotel staff, being considered lower priority for available-on-request amenities that the hotel may only have in limited quantities e.g. rollaway beds and minifridges, and the like.\n\n\nEmail\nFor booking by email, the sequence of events is roughly the same, with some steps omitted when not applicable:\n\nfirst, ask whether your dates are available; ask for up-to-date prices\ninquire on your preferred rooms and other essential details\nask to reserve for your dates\nask for confirmation for your embassy; provide all personal details (passport details of every visitor etc.) they may need to issue the confirmation\nin the end, ask for cancellation policy, directions to the hotel and other practical details that don't affect your decision to stay there.\nWhen you use a non-native language for writing to a hotel, it works best to ask one or two questions per email, get answers and then choose your next questions. Asking all questions at once frequently results in huge delays that can be broken only by a telephone call.\nAvoid giving sensitive financial information such as credit card details through email. Use the website's booking engine for that instead and make sure you see in your browser a padlock that is locked (which should appear when using https:// at the start of the URL).\n\n\nTravel agent\nTravel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, like camping grounds, through a travel agent.  Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.  They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).  Any amendments or requests though should be coursed through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.\n\n\nTelephone\nConsumers often find the best lodging rates by calling travel suppliers directly. Contacting the specific property, rather than the chain's main toll-free telephone line, provides the best opportunity to negotiate discounts and ask about specials (advertised and unadvertised). In the U.S., hotel and lodging listings can be found for free either by name or category via 1-800-Free411.\n\n\nCancelling a reservation\nYou might have to change or cancel a reservation. For example, if your plane/train/bus is delayed or cancelled and you therefore arrive a day later.\nDepending on how you booked the accommodation, you may be able to contact the hotel or pension directly by phone or internet to make the necessary change/cancellation.  If it was booked through a travel agent or consolidator, you may need to go through them.\nPay attention to the cancellation policy when you make the reservation.  Most hotels will require a credit card number to guarantee the room.  They will usually charge you for one night if you cancel less than 24 hours before arrival.  In some popular tourist destinations such as Hawaii or Las Vegas, this minimum notice may be as long as 72 hours, or you may be charged for the entire stay.  This can happen even when you make reservations through a travel agent and your delay is caused by transportation also arranged by that travel agent.\n\n\nOn the day\n\nIf you have planned your trip yourself, which means you have not decided to use a package from a travel agent, sometimes finding accommodation when you arrive is the best option.\nIf you have not made reservations in advance, this should be your first priority upon arriving.  The best and/or cheapest hotels have a tendency to fill up most quickly, and looking for a place to sleep as darkness falls can be an anxious \u2013 and even dangerous \u2013 experience.\nIt is sometimes frustrating to be reading a guidebook and looking for the listed recommendations trying to decipher an unfamiliar map having just travelled for several hours.  Walk around and inquire at the first few places you see.  Courage and confidence are required for this type of thing, especially if you are not using your native languages.  However, it is sometimes easier to do this rather than tracking down listings, especially for the first night.\nLarger cities and popular tourist destinations may have \"tourist information offices\".  These may be operated by the local government, a consortium of local hotels and attractions, or independent parties (of varying trustworthiness).  These frequently offer listings of hotels and other lodging options (e.g. hostels, bed-and-breakfasts).  Some act as booking agents for hotels, placing visitors in facilities with vacancies (though there may be a fee for this service).\nLooking at last-minute accommodations may not be feasible if your intended destination country requires a visa be obtained in advance; many such countries require that visitors have already arranged accommodation before approving a visa or admitting a traveller into the country.\n\n\nFinding bargains\nSee also: Budget travel#Sleep\nNewly opened hotels.  Frequently, the best hotels are those that just opened. Beyond being modern, they need to attract client\u00e8le, and may strive to offer more comfort or services for less money. It often makes sense to ask locals upon arrival which hotels/B&Bs, etc., have opened in the last year or two.\nGroup deals. If you travel with a group or a travel agency, the rate per person might be lower.\nLast-minute offers.  Many hotels discount their unsold rooms and sell them through specialist 'last minute' type consolidators. The reduced rates available from these consolidators are not usually advertised in the hotels themselves (the hotels do not want to advertise these lower rates to guests who are paying full rates). Contacting a consolidator directly can save you money and, especially in larger cities, legwork \u2013 the better companies will usually telephone the hotels within your budget to confirm availability, important when you've got tired legs in a large city like London for example. Look for consolidators offering both telephone and online booking services so you are not dependent on internet access when trying to find a hotel.\nOff season \u2013 or the right day of week. Check business hotels for weekends and resort hotels for weekdays, be aware of local holidays and consider non-peak seasons. Sunday night both weekend tourists and business travellers are away, so you could use it for a night in an expensive city. Some establishments publish off season prices, for others negotiating a better price may be possible. Depending on your destination, some individual attractions may be closed off-season; check whether what you want to see is open before booking a trip.\nLocation Location Location \u2013 It has been said that those are the three only things that matter for a hotel. Quite often a bargain can be had for a hotel that is a bit out of the way. For many camping sites this is the whole raison d'\u00eatre \u2013 being on cheap plentiful land outside major settlements or in the back of beyond. Some of the best deals are available for a hostel or hotel that is just a bit farther away from the ferry dock or the bus stop everybody arrives at than most people will likely venture. A suburban hotel at a public transit line to the inner city might be more affordable. Of course all of this comes with the obvious downside of your accommodation being far away from many things, and if that means you spend more on transportation it could outweigh the money you saved on lodging.\n\n\nTypes of accommodation\n\n\nHotels\n\nMain article: Hotels\n\n\nGeneral\nHotels provide private serviced rooms for guests. They range from very basic budget-style to extremely luxurious accommodation; various rating systems award \"stars\" (or \"diamonds\", in one automobile association system) based on levels of provided amenity. Grand old hotels are glamorous hotels, usually dating back a hundred years or more.\n\n\nCapsule hotels\nCapsule hotels are a cheap form of accommodation in Japan, usually more or less on par with a dorm bed in a hostel, in terms of pricing. The \"rooms\" are little more than small one-person capsules with only a mattress, radio, and TV (which usually boasts a variety of Japanese porn channels). Note that most capsule hotels are segregated by gender, while many, if not most, don't accept female guests at all.\n\n\nScattered Hotels\nThe idea of scattered hotels got its start in the early 1980s in Italy. The goal was to revive tourism in an earthquake-damaged corner of northeastern Italy in the 1970s. A \"Diffuso hotel\" consists of different accommodations in different buildings scattered throughout the village. For those who do not love staying at a hotel, an Albergo Diffuso is a balance between a hotel and a house. \n\n\nResorts\nA resort or a resort hotel is usually separated from the local community (in some cases a gated community) with restaurants, shopping, and other amenities on site. A destination resort can be integrated with a main attraction, such as a theme park, a ski lift, or a spa.\n\n\nMotels\n\nMain article: Motels\nMotels (motor hotels or motor courts) evolved from the primitive cabin camps of the 1930s to become inexpensive, single-story hotels in which motorists entered their rooms directly from the car park instead of through an inside corridor. In the 1950s, many of these were built quickly and inexpensively at the edge of towns on the main two-lane highways of the era. As these roads were increasingly bypassed by freeways, independent motels began to decline, ultimately being supplanted by economy limited service hotel chains which appeared at motorway exits in the 1980s and 1990s. In some European countries, \"motel\" may refer to any low-cost hotel; in others (particularly in South America) it may refer to a \"no-tell motel\" where rooms can be rented for as little as a few hours. In Oceania, it is common for motel rooms to incorporate mini-kitchens often fully equipped with utensils, cutlery and crockery for preparing your own meals.\n\n\nHostels\nMain article: Hostels\nHostels, also referred to as backpackers or youth hostels (for historical reasons; there is usually no upper age limit now in most regions). These are usually low-budget dormitory accommodation but may also have private rooms available. Usually kitchen facilities are a must, but the kitchen may be sacrificed in third-world countries where labour is cheap and even impecunious young visitors are rich in local wage terms.\n\n\nInns\n\nHistorically, inns were local roadhouses which offered food, water, stables, drink and lodging at short, periodic intervals on the main horse and stagecoach roads. These date to imperial Roman times, but were largely supplanted by downtown hotels in the railway era, which in turn lost traffic to roadside motels (and then to chain hotels) in the motorcar era. Along the Silk Road and elsewhere in Asia they had something similar called caravanserai; like the inns these are now mostly gone. Ryokan are traditional Japanese inns, and a visit to one is the highlight of a trip to Japan for many.\nAs any establishment offering any of the functions of the coaching inns is free to use \"inn\" in its name, a few establishments brand a British-style pub, restaurant or tavern as an \"inn\" even if they offer no lodging facilities. Most use the term \"inn\" as just another modern synonym for \"hotel\", where it often appears in names of major chains \u2013 including some with no restaurant. A \"motor inn\" or \"motor lodge\" is a motel.\n\n\nBed and breakfasts\nMain article: Bed and breakfasts\nBed and breakfasts (B&Bs), guesthouses and g\u00eetes provide private, serviced bedrooms for their guests. They are typically private residences and you will interact with your hosts and other guests, often eating together and sharing common spaces. Bed and breakfasts and guesthouses are found both inside and out of major centres. Many market themselves as providing a \"quiet escape\"; some can be found through associations or at independent websites, others eschew formally marketing themselves at all, relying on word of mouth and repeat visitors or just a swinging \"Vacancy\" sign to attract passing travellers in rural areas.\nSometimes B&B is used as a synonym of guesthouse; they don't necessarily offer breakfast in all countries.\nIn France, a \"g\u00eete\" as a tourist home does not necessarily include breakfast; in Canada, \"g\u00eete\" and its variants (g\u00eete du passant, g\u00eete et d\u00e9jeuner) are almost always B&Bs, even where \"d\u00e9jeuner\" (breakfast) isn't spelled out explicitly.\n\n\nHospitality exchange\nMain article: Home exchange\nA hospitality exchange or home stay network is an organization that connects travellers with local residents in the cities they're visiting. If travellers can connect with the right people at the right time, they can get room and sometimes board in the place they're visiting for free or at very modest prices. Network size ranges from a few thousand to millions, and most networks are growing steadily. These have disrupted the industry to a great degree. \nA related variant is home exchange, which involves staying in private homes during times they would otherwise be vacant. This provides room but no board which is a great option to many who don't need it.\n\n\nShips, trains, and planes\n\nMain article: Sleeper trains\nOn long rail journeys, a sleeper car is often available for a price, allowing the traveller to sleep in moderate comfort on the train. Bunks and cabins are also available on some overnight ferry trips, such as the six to fourteen hour voyage from Canada to Newfoundland and many of the Baltic Sea ferries.\nTypically, the least expensive options are crowded and noisy; more comfortable accommodation is available at a premium.\nSleeping on board of a vehicle is a method for minimum budget travel.\n\n\nCar camping\n\nMain article: Car camping\nSee also: Renting a motorhome in New Zealand\nCar camping, Caravaning or RV camping involves carrying your equipment in your motor vehicle, which you drive right to your campsite. The focus is usually to enjoy the site, cook-outs, day hikes, and other outdoor activities. Some use their vehicle for transportation, pitching a stand-alone tent to sleep in; others pull a pop-up trailer/tent or use their car or van as part of the tent or shade structure. Some drive large vans or recreational vehicles which may include many of the comforts of home (on a more compact scale).\nCaravan parks tend to have two or three types of accommodation: powered sites to put your caravan and car; caravans owned by the park that you can stay in; and small cabins with a bit more space. Often they also have an area separate from the caravan parking area, for those with just a tent. In some locations, the site also hosts a marina.\nCaravan parks are usually located in medium-sized towns and cities, or in very popular tourist spots. Some commercial camp grounds provide showers, a general store, picnic areas, an amusement park, a beach or an outdoor swimming pool.\n\n\nCamping\nMain article: Camping\nSee also: Wild camping, Outdoor life\nCamping is do-it-yourself accommodation: you carry your roof and your bedding in your backpack or your car (or whatever). It is often the only choice of accommodation you have when hiking or travelling off the beaten track, but there are also very popular sites for camping holidays. Many car camping sites have an area for those coming with just a tent. On these, or other areas especially for campers, there are usually at least basic facilities, such as fresh water and toilets.\nIn e.g. the Nordic countries the right to camp is a fundamental part of the right to access: you may put your tent more or less anywhere (outside developed or protected areas) for a night or two, as long as your camping does not disturb or harm nature or people.\n\n\nBoats\n\nAt some destinations, it is possible to rent houseboats or other small craft with sleeping bunks, a campstove-equipped galley and primitive toilet facilities on board.\nMarinas may be able to offer short-term dock rental with some caravan park-like amenities such as shore power hookups and Wi-Fi.\n\n\nCabins\nSee also: Holiday villas, Second homes, Cottage rentals in Canada\nCabins and cottages in rural destinations, such as hunting or fishing outfitters camps, or at camping sites, represent one step up from camping. There are also better equipped and even luxurious ones with most of the comforts of home. As they provide cooking facilities and a living room or similar space, they are popular among families and other groups. The typical size is suitable for a small family, but size varies from those for just a couple to ones with several bedrooms for even large groups. Visitors are generally expected to make their beds and clean up for themselves. Linen are often not included in the price, not necessarily even sheets and pillows. This kind of accommodation is often rented for a week, although, except for single cabins in the backwoods, most are available also for single nights.\nCabins and cottages are often found in remote locations (such as a small, quiet lake at the end of a long, winding, poorly-marked country road), but also at camping sites and as an alternative to hotels at resorts. The cottages are often available in groups, with an office providing advice and some additional services, quite often e.g. a caf\u00e9 with meals. For single cottages you should usually get all advice beforehand, although you may have a phone number for any unexpected problems.\nFor the end-of-winding-road version, check whether facilities you expect are provided and be prepared if not. Electricity and running water (hot or otherwise) may not be available and heating may be in the form of a wood stove. You may need to bring your own linen, food or other supplies. There may even be some walking or boating required to get to the cabin. The most primitive ones can be excellent for \"getting away from it all\", and may even be cheaper than a tent lot at a camping area.\nVillas can usually accommodate a minimum of four people, offering more space and privacy than a hotel room. Each typically has its own kitchen, living/dining room, bedroom and in many cases a private swimming pool. The rental price is charged per week, which for extended stays may prove more cost-effective than a hotel.\nThe line between cabins, villas and vacation rentals (see below) is not clear. Villas and vacation rentals tend to be in the high end and in areas with more tourists, but terminology varies between regions and there are no definite definitions.\n\n\nWilderness huts\n\nWilderness huts or refuges are spartan cabins on hiking routes and similar. They vary from guesthouse- or B&B-like to huts with roof, walls, a fireplace (if that), and not much more. There are even lean-to shelters, which are open towards the fireplace outside. The comfort level is usually quite consistent along a trail or in a country or area, perhaps with some simpler huts meant only for lunch breaks and emergencies, and higher standard lodgings found at trail crossings, popular destinations and places with road connections.\nMountain cabins are invaluable as refuges in bad weather. There are good networks e.g. in parts of the Alps, in Norway and in Finnish national parks. Where there is a reliable network of huts or cabins they may allow hiking without carrying tent and sleeping bag (given that you can manage in bad weather without them). In some you can buy food or meals, so that carrying just what you need in the day suffices. Check what is offered, so that you carry what you need.\nFor many wilderness huts advance bookings are not needed, as they have to be available in unexpected bad weather. Some are unmanned and unlocked, paid with an honor system (on site or afterwards), some even free. On the other hand, unmanned huts rely on the guests taking care of themselves and of basic maintenance. Make sure to leave them in as good a state as you found them.\n\n\nCondominiums and timeshares\n\nSee also: Timeshares\nLike a privately owned summer cottage, a condominium or timeshare requires that the traveller incur the capital cost of real estate ownership at the destination. Unlike a private cottage, a condominium confers possession of just one room or suite in a larger building; a timeshare confers partial possession (typically one room of a hotel or resort for one week a year).\nThe legal arrangements vary. In some countries you can get to own a room, suite or apartment of a condominium, otherwise you might get a share of the company that owns and maintains it, or you are just a tenant who has invested money for that privilege. The actual form of possession may be critical for what say you have in how the property is run and maintained \u2013 and what expenses you will have, and whether it will be attractive for potential buyers of your share.\nThese arrangements can be inflexible as the investor continues to incur significant expense even during years when they don't have time to travel, cannot afford to travel or would prefer to go elsewhere for a change. As with any bet on real estate, prices can rise or fall substantially over time. They may be very difficult to get rid of.\n\n\nVacation rentals\nMain article: Vacation rentals\nVacation rentals are houses and apartments of residents of popular tourist destinations, which are leased to visitors. The residence may have been bought specifically for this purpose or the normal occupants may vacate it during some parts of the year. The guests will have full use of the residence, usually with utilities included but no servicing or meals.  This approach can be cheaper than booking a hotel room for the same length of time (and give more space than a hotel room), especially if travelling with a family or other sizeable group of people.  Facilities will vary depending on the property, but usually include kitchen and laundry facilities and possibly amenities like a swimming pool (or access to a communal pool), a games room (table tennis, pool, game consoles), and TV/video/DVD players.  Contacting the owners directly is the ideal way to make arrangements as they can answer any questions you may have about the property, and may offer more competitive pricing since there's no middle-man.\n\n\nSecond homes\nMain article: Second homes\nA second home is a long-term owned or rented dwelling, away from the owner's primary home, such as a cottage. This is a long-term commitment, usually for coming generations.\n\n\nExotic an novelty accommodation\n\nSee also: Novelty architecture\nThere are exotic hotels in some areas:\n\nin sandstone caves: Goreme (Turkey), Ia (Santorini, Greece)\nin rock caves: (Matala, Greece; 'Anatolian Houses' near Rock Sites of Cappadocia, Turkey)\non trees: Rafter's Retreat in Kitulgala (Sri Lanka); tree houses in Olympos and \u00c7\u0131ral\u0131 (Turkey)\non rock cliffs\non moving vehicles (a rail sleeper car is standard enough, but a blimp or a Zeppelin?)\nin theme parks or pioneer village living museums, styled or restored to match the park\nin a nature preserve, as a three-story giant mushroom (Reino Fungi Lodge, Panguipulli, Chile)\nbeside the midtown New York Public Library, a 10-story Library Hotel's numbered rooms whose artwork and d\u00e9cor follow Dewey's Decimal System\nice hotels such as in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi (Sweden), Valcartier (Canada), and Kemi and Kittil\u00e4 (Finland\nisland hotels such as Sveti Stefan (originally a fishers village)\nunderwater bedroom: Conrad Maldives Rangali Island (Maldives), Jules Undersea Lodge (Key Largo FL US)\nas well as unusual hostels:\n\nin a former convict settlement (Darlington, Tasmania)\nin a decommissioned jail such as in Ottawa-Gatineau (Canada), Helsinki (Finland), and Stockholm and Visby (Sweden)\nNovelty motels include:\n\nFaux wigwams/teepees such as Holbrook AZ, San Bernardino CA, Cave City KY (US)\nCaboose inns (in decommissioned rail cars): (US, various)\nCabin court of permanently-installed VW minibus or camper vans\nNostalgia motels restored to 1940s or 1950s themes (US Route 66)\nGrain silos as individual motel rooms or short-stay apartments: (Little River, NZ)\nUnderground motels (including a few former mine sites in Australia)\nNovelty bed and breakfasts may be\n\nHistoric lighthouses\nShipboard floating B&B ('Golden Slipper' yacht, Boston)\nIn the former machine room atop a Dutch harbour crane (Havenkraan & Lighthouse, Harlingen (Netherlands)).
