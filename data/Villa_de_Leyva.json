  "extract": "Villa de Leyva is a charming old colonial city in the Boyac\u00e1 region of Colombia. Calm and quiet on weekdays, it gets flooded by tourists from Bogot\u00e1 on the weekends.  Villa de Leyva is one of the few towns in Colombia that conserved all its colonial architecture. It is 150 km north from Bogot\u00e1 and has a nice dry and warm weather, although it gets windy and cold in the evening.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nVilla de Leyva was founded on June 12th 1572, by Captain Hernan Su\u00e1rez de Villalobos, as instructed by the first president of the New Kingdom of Granada Sr. Andres D\u00edaz Venero de Leyva. Initially Villa de Leyva was established close to the Indian Astronomic Observatory in a place called Zaquencip\u00e1 Valley, and then twelve years later was moved to its actual location. During the colonisation, Villa de Leyva was a principal producer of oil olive and some cereals, especially wheat and barley. It was chosen as a favorite place for Spanish families and especially as place to rest for viceroys.\nVilla de Leyva was home of the Captain Antonio Ricaurte, a hero in the San Mateo battle during the war of independence. The General and President of the New Republic Antonio Nari\u00f1o spent his last days in this town. In 1812 there was the meeting of the first congress of the United Provinces. In 1830 the construction of the road to connect Villa de Leyva with Tunja which passed by Arcabuco began. The construction of this road started the development of this beautiful village. In 1954 Villa de Leyva was declared a National Monument.\nThe architecture of Villa de Leyva has a Spanish style. You can see in the construction of most of the houses in the village, their wonderful balconies, arcs and main doors (it is possible to appreciate this in the old buildings such as Casa del Primer Congreso, Casa de Don Antonio Nario\u00f1o, Casa de La Real Fabrica de Licores, Claustro de San Agust\u00edn). Villa de Leyva is a place of inspiration to poets and writers. They can find peace in its stone paved streets or just contemplating the majestic main square, unique in Latin-America.\nVilla de Leyva is at 2.143 meters above sea level, with a lovely temperature of 18 \u00b0C and a population of 12,000 inhabitants. Its size is 128 km\u00b2. Villa de Leyva\u2019s borders are: Arcabuco and Gachantiva in the north, Sachica and Ch\u00edquiza to the south, Ch\u00edquiza and San Pedro de Iguaque to the east and Santa Sofia, Sutamarchan and Gachantiva to the west.\n\nThe Iguaque\u2019s Sanctuary of Flora and Fauna is an ecological reserve (6,700 hectares). It is home to a great variety of native species and is a part of the National Parks Unit. The reserve goes from 2,800 to 3,800 meters above sea level, and it is possible to see different kinds of ecosystems like the Andean high jungle, and the Stunted Jungle which reaches the majestic Moor called Paramo. Apart from these reasons, The Iguaque Sanctuary is also a very important reserve of water for the entire region. Also, it has eight glacier lakes, one of which contains the origins of the Bachue legend.\nA variety of fossils have been found around Villa de Leyva. These have been deemed important because of their sizes and their very relevant contributions made to paleontological investigations. Found in 1945, The Plesiosaurus is more than 115 million years old, and is part of the National Geological Museum\u2019s collection. It is also the finding place of The Ichthyosaurus, a marine reptile that lived between 110 and 115 million years ago, which is 8 m long and without a tail, and is very similar to another similar specimen found in Australia. These discoveries show that Villa de Leyva was immersed by the sea before the Andes Mountains were formed.\nIn agreement with the Muisca\u2019s mythology, the Iguaque lake legend says that a beautiful woman called Bachue, walked out from the lake with a boy of three years of age (Iguaque). They were the origin of the most important Indian tribe in Colombia called the Muisca. Anthropologic research says that the Muisca civilization was a very clever tribe, especially for their knowledge of agriculture, pottery and astronomy. The evidence of this is possible to see in the \u2018Infiernito\u2019 (the little hell) well known as the Muisca Astronomic Observatory.\n\n\nGet in\n\nFrom Tunja: minibuses leave every fifteen minutes.
