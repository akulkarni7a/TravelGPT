  "extract": "Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Az\u0259rbaycan) is a former Soviet republic in the Caucasus and is variously considered part of Europe or Asia. \nOften known as the \"Land of Fire\", Azerbaijan was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Persian Empire in the late 19th century.\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n\nThere are 71 urban settlements in Azerbaijan with the official status of a city. However, only 3 of them have population more than 300,000 people \u2014 Baku, Sumqayit and Ganja \u2014 and Sumgayit is de facto a suburb of Baku today. Here are the most important destinations to explore in the country:\n\n1 Baku (Bak\u0131) \u2014 The capital and largest city of the Caucasus.\n2 Ganja (G\u0259nc\u0259) \u2014 Azerbaijan's second largest city has a long history, some important sites and an interesting and manifold architecture.\n3 Lankaran (L\u0259nk\u0259ran) \u2014 Southern city near the Iranian border.\n4 Nakhchivan (Nax\u00e7\u0131van) \u2014 The administrative capital of Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan exclave.\n5 Qabala \u2014 A new resort town deep in Caucasian Mountains, which has taken its name given from the archaeological site about 20 km southwest.\n6 Sheki \u2014 A beautiful city in the forested Caucasus Mountains with lots to see and do. It has one of the largest densities of cultural resources and monuments that span 2,700 years of Azerbaijani history.\n7 Shemakha \u2014 The capital city of Shirvanshahs before Baku.\n8 Sumqayit \u2014 Due to its industrial plants, the Blacksmith Institute, a US environmental pollution agency, ranked the city as the first in the most polluted cities of the planet, both in 2006 and 2007.\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n\nNotable national parks and reserves\n\n1 Qobustan National Historical-Artistic Reserve \u2014 best known for its rock petroglyphs (a UNESCO World Heritage site) and mud volcanoes. Mud volcano wise, a better option might be the free site a little further south, see Baku Region.\n2 G\u00f6yg\u00f6l National Park \u2014 about 25 km further afield from Ganja, near To\u011fanal\u0131. A hiking and leisure destination, whose lake was formed during a strong earthquake in 1139.\n Ismailli State Reserve \u2014 a national park, also offering some fancy hotels.\n\n\nNotable towns and villages\n3 Khinalug (Xinaliq) \u2014 A scenic, remote and ancient mountain village, and the mountain of the same name nearby. Once a centre of Zoroastrianism; today the few inhabitants are an ethnic isolate believed to be descendants of the Caucasus Albanians (unrelated to modern-day Albanians of Albania).\n4 Nabran (Nebran) \u2014 Nabran is rich in many recreational facilities offering a wide range of services: luxury accommodation, sports activities, children's camps and music entertainment venues.\n5 Quba \u2014 Its urban suburb is home to the largest Azerbaijani Jewish community in the mountains and is considered one of the largest Jewish communities in the former Soviet Union.\n6 Lahich \u2014 A cozy and remote highland village, and potential \"base camp\" for tracks to Quba through the Caucasus Mountains.\n7 Qax \u2014 A gateway into the Caucasian Mountains besides Sheki, and \"base camp\" for treks towards Sar\u0131ba\u015f and into the Alazan Valley .\n Nij (Nic) \u2014 Enormous village of endangering Christian ethnic group, the Udins.\n G\u00f6yg\u00f6l \u2014 A must visit German town in the suburbs of Ganja, formerly named Khanlar (Xanlar) and Helenendorf, founded by German farmers from Bavarian Swabia. Today, the town remains an old German neighbourhood in excellent conditions and partly renovated, including a Lutheran church. A local museum shows the finds (e.g. bronze weapons, jewels, pottery, etc.) extracted from a large cemetery excavated in 1990.\n Shamkir \u2014 Another by Germans populated town. There are cognac and wine plantations.\n\n\nResorts\nShahdag Ski Resort \u2014 in Northeastern Azerbaijan.\nSki Complex \"Tufan\" \u2014 near Gabala in the Sheki Region.\n8 Naftalan \u2014 A well-known petroleum spa resort, the centre of medical tourism in Azerbaijan.\nBeaches of Absheron Peninsula and Northeastern Azerbaijan. This region is home to the top-rated beaches and luxury resorts of the Caspian coast.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nEver at the crossroads between east and west, Azerbaijan has seen the comings and goings of several great empires.\n\n\nAncient\nSome of the country's best attractions are the Gobustan petroglyphs. These are the markings of people who lived in the area 40,000 - 5,000 years ago. Scythians and Iranian Medes occupied the area in around 900\u2013700 BCE. The Achaemenids made things interesting by introducing Zoroastrianism in around 550 BCE. Later, the area was on the fringes of Alexander the Great's empire and the Roman Empire.\n\n\nMedieval\nChristianity came in the fourth century but disappeared when the area became part of the second Islamic (Umayyad) Caliphate in the 7th century. Various local kingdoms emerged after the Umayyad Caliphate fell in 750 CE, before the Mongols conquered Azerbaijan in the 11th century.\n\n\nEarly Modern\nAfter the various Mongol empires withdrew, the area fell to the Persians. Persian control was not tight and highly independent khanates controlled the region until the Russian Empire expanded southward in the early 19th century. The traditional Azeri lands ended up being split between Persia and the Russian Empire; today's Republic of Azerbaijan comprised the part of the Azeri lands that were ceded to the Russian Empire, while the parts that Persia retained control of remain part of Iran as Iranian Azerbaijan. Oil was first drilled here in the late 19th century.\n\n\nSoviet\nThe fall of the Russian Empire saw the brief emergence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918. However, Lenin realized that the region's oil was vital to the Soviet army and, along with Georgia and Armenia, Azerbaijan was rolled into the USSR by the 1920s. Azerbaijan's oil was vital again to the Soviets in the Second World War, in which 250,000 of the country's 3.4 million people were killed at the front.\n\n\nPost-Soviet\nAs Soviet control weakened in 1991, the mostly ethnic Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region, backed by Armenia, fought for independence from Azerbaijan, and ethnically cleansed its Azeri population. Azerbaijan lost 14% of its territory and gained some 800,000 refugees and internally displaced, and also ethnically cleansed its Armenian population. Despite a 1994 cease-fire, the status of Nagorno-Karabakh was not resolved until 2023, when a new Azerbaijani offensive resulted in the surrender of the rebels. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian population has mostly fled to Armenia, and the area is expected to be repopulated with ethnic Azeris. Since independence, Turkey has been Azerbaijan's closest ally, though unlike U.S.-aligned Georgia, relations between Azerbaijan and Russia remain cordial.\n\n\nCulture\nThe majority of the population (over 92%) is composed of Azeris, who share a culture very similar to Turkey. Ethnic Azeris are also Iran's largest ethnic minority, with Iran having a larger Azeri population than independent Azerbaijan, although over time the influence of Russian and Persian culture produced some differences between the Azeris of Azerbaijan and the Azeris of Iran. In particular, almost two centuries of Russian and Soviet rule have brought a very liberal attitude towards Islam among the Azeris of Azerbaijan, who nevertheless remain mostly Shi'ite Muslims.\nFollowing independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has allowed Western European companies to develop its extensive energy resources and its oil production has skyrocketed especially since the mid-2000s. Despite this and related investments, most of the new-found wealth remains in the hands of a few people. While downtown Baku is thriving with new buildings and a growing middle class, much of the country's countryside remains poor and relatively undeveloped. The government  remains strongly authoritarian.\n\n\nCelebrate\n\nThese are the nationally recognized holidays for people living in Azerbaijan.\n\nNew Year (1\u20132 January)\nWomen's Day (8 March)\nVictory Day (9 May)\nRepublic Day (28 May)\nDay of National Salvation of Azerbaijan People (15 June)\nDay of Military Forces of Azerbaijan Republic (26 June)\nState Sovereignty Day (18 October)\nConstitution Day (12 November)\nNational Rebirth Day (17 November)\nSolidarity Day of World Azerbaijanis (31 December)\nNovruz Bayram \u2013 5 days\nGurban Bayram (Day of Sacrifice) - 2 days\nEid el Fitr (post-Ramadan celebration) 2\u20133 days\n\n\nClimate\n\nAzerbaijan is known for having nine of the 11 existing ecological zones. Much of the country is temperate year-round. Nation-wide the average temperature for the year is 14-15\u00b0C (57-59\u00b0F). The Caucasus Mountains protect the country from the Arctic air masses that affect Russia in winter while the Caspian Sea shields it from the hot, dry air of Central Asia in the summer. Temperatures in the winter are cool (0-10\u00b0C/32-59\u00b0F) at lower altitudes and along the coast and drops moderately as you head inland and drastically as you head into the mountains (-20\u00b0C/-4\u00b0F) is possible in the Caucasus Mountains). Summers range from warm to hot (20-40\u00b0C/68-104\u00b0F) and humid throughout most of the country, although breezes off the Caspian provide some relief along the coast. Nakhchivan is quite different, high and arid, summers here can easily surpass 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) while winter nights often drop below -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F)...in fact the country's extreme minimum and maximum (-33\u00b0C/-27\u00b0F & 46\u00b0C/115\u00b0F) were both recorded in southern Nakhchivan!\nSnow is rare in Baku and along the coast in general while common inland and copious in the mountains, where many villages may be cut off during the winter. The southern forests are the wettest part of the country, with plenty of rain in late autumn and early spring. The western central coast is fairly dry. Lankaran receives the most annual precipitation (1600\u20131800 mm/63\u201371 in) while the region around Baku averages 200 mm (8 in). Baku is very breezy, much like Chicago or Wellington, most of the year.\n\n\nTerrain\n\nMuch of the large, flat Kura-Araks lowlands (Kur-Araz Ovaligi) are below sea level with the Great Caucasus Mountains towering on the northern horizons. The Karabakh uplands (Qarabag Yaylasi) lie to the west, while Baku is situated on the Apsheron peninsula (Abseron Yasaqligi that juts into the Caspian Sea.\nThe lowest point is the Caspian Sea at \u221227 m (\u221289 ft) with the highest point being Bazarduzu Dagi at 4,466m (14,652 ft)\nAbsheron Yasaqligi (including Baku and Sumgayit) and the Caspian Sea are ecological concerns because of pollution from oil spills that date back more than a century ago. Heavy car traffic in the capital contributes to heavy pollution as well.\n\n\nEconomy\nAzerbaijan's number one export is oil. Azerbaijan's oil production declined through 1997 but has registered an increase every year since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development.\nAzerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects.\nThe government has begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the location of new pipelines in the region and Azerbaijan's ability to manage its oil wealth.\n\n\nElectricity\nElectricity is supplied at 220 V 50 Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\" or the compatible, but non-grounded, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types. Generally speaking, U.S. and Canadian travelers should pack an adapter for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Azerbaijan.\nAdditionally, some older buildings may be still equipped with Soviet-era outlets. The Soviet GOST-7396 standard was very similar to the current European CEE-7/7 \"Schuko plug\", but the pins were of a 4.0 mm diameter, while the Schuko features 4.8 mm pins. As such, the pins of a Schuko may be too large to fit into a Soviet-era outlet, although the smaller Europlug will still fit. Although the Soviet-era outlets have largely been phased out, travellers who are particularly concerned with having the ability to plug in at all times may consider packing an adapter for the Soviet-era outlets too, just in case.\nAlso, make sure to bring your own automated voltage adapter because the electricity in Azerbaijan short circuits and \"jumps\" a lot and many items may get damaged if you don't bring the adapter.\n\n\nVisitor information\nOfficial tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nVisa requirements\nIn 2016 Azerbaijan introduced a new single-entry eVisa for citizens of the following countries:\n\nAll European Union member states, as well as Andorra, Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Vatican City\nAlgeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, and Vietnam\nThe eVisa costs US$20, plus $4 for administration fee, is valid for 30 days within the next three months after application, and can be purchased at evisa.gov.az \u2013 photocopy of your passport, and address of your stay needs to be provided. Caution: there is a fake official website: evisa.com.az \u2013 also providing visas but requiring you to purchase an overpriced tour or expensive hotel.\nA visa is not required for stays of 90 days or less for citizens of Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\nA 30-day visa on arrival may be obtained only when arriving by air by citizens of Bahrain, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey (60 days) and United Arab Emirates.\nCitizens of the United States may also obtain a visa on arrival at Heydar Aliyev International Airport, but only if arriving via a direct flight of Azerbaijan Airlines from New York City.\nCitizens of Iran may obtain a 15-day visa on arrival for Nakhchivan only.\nFor citizens of all other countries visas can be obtained by mail or in person from any Azerbaijani embassy offering consular services. A letter of invitation (LOI) from a contact in Azerbaijan is required.\nForeigners staying in Azerbaijan for longer than 15 days should register with the State Migration Service within 15 working days of arrival. Failure to register within this time frame will incur a fine of 300 manat (2019). The registration is free and can be done online by submitting copy of the passport and filled in application form or in person at specially designed offices of State Migration Service (one of such offices will be opened eventually at the Train Station, however it was closed as of 2015). Hotels may provide this service for their guests, but travellers are strongly advised to ensure the registration has been completed indeed as hotels are more than often skip doing it.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nThe primary international gateway is Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku (GYD IATA), with additional international airports (whose international routes are basically just Moscow and Istanbul) found in Nakhchivan City (NAJ IATA), Ganja (KVD IATA), and Lankaran (LLK IATA).\nNational air company AZAL (Azerbaijan Airlines) is the main carrier which flies to Ganja, Nakhchivan, Tbilisi, Aktau, Tehran, Tel-Aviv, Ankara, Istanbul IST, Istanbul Sahiha Gokchen, Antalya (seasonal), Bodrum (seasonal), Dubai, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kyiv, Rostov-on-Don, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Mineralniye Vodi, Milan, London (daily) and Paris, Prague, Rome. Lufthansa also has a couple flights a week to Baku (which continue onwards to Ashgabat). Turkish Airlines is another carrier connecting Baku with and via Istanbul. Also, there are several Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Iranian, and Austrian airlines connecting Baku with several cities of the world.\nQatar Airways flies 2 flights a day, one to Tbilisi and one to Doha connecting to their global network.\n\n Baku Taxi Services, bakutaxi@gmail.com. Airport pick up and drop off. 33 manat for Baku - Airport or Airport - Baku. Up to 3 passengers. Reliable and local rates to other locations. English is spoken. \n\n\nBy train\nDirect trains connect Azerbaijan with Russia (Moscow and Rostov). Timetables are here. Click on the earth for international timetables. The Russian border used to be closed to non-CIS passport holders but it is now open to everyone with respective visas.\nThere is a domestic train line running from Astara on the Iranian border to Baku and a 300 km connector line is being built from Astara to Qazvin, Iran to connect the Azerbaijani and Iranian rail networks.\nFor those planning to visit the exclave of Nakhchivan, there is a rail service to Mashad in Iran.\n\n\nBy car\nThere are roads to all cities of Azerbaijan. They are not really wide and most of them have only two lanes. Local travel agents can arrange private cars to the borders. Some Georgian travel agents such as Exotour can arrange pickup in Baku to delivery in Tbilisi. Although more expensive than bus or train, it will be faster and can be combined with sightseeing along the way. Azerbaijani customs used to request payment of a deposit of several thousand US dollars for foreign cars, however, as of 2020, restrictive customs rules on importing older cars and requiring large deposits are a thing of the past.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are buses that run daily from Georgia, Turkey, Iran and Russia to Azerbaijan.\nA minibus also runs from the Georgian border at Krazny Most (Red Bridge) and should cost about 10 or 12 manat (or 25 lari). It can be picked up at either side of the border (don't worry if they ask you to pay on the Georgian side - they turn up to pick you up. Insist on bringing your own bags across, however). Journey time to Baku should take about 8 hours. Driving in Azerbaijan is a genuinely scary experience. Virtually all drivers have scant regard for the rules of the road and the standard of roads themselves is shockingly poor. It is emphatically not for the faint-hearted, so whilst the long train might challenge your stamina they won't your nerves. Check AZAL flights from Tbilisi-Baku well in advance for some reasonable deals.\nReturn to Tbilisi can be caught at the indescribably chaotic bus station, which doubles up as an eerily quiet shopping-centre (take bus 65 from outside Double Gate in the old town for the 20-min trip, which leaves you with a 400 m long dodgy stretch of road/highway with pestering taxi-drivers on which to walk: cost 0.20 manat) or simply taxi it from the centre for approx. 15 manat (worth it!), which saves on hassle. Both buses and minibuses are available from this station directly to Tbilisi, about 12 manat for both. Bus counter 26 at very back of ground floor. The bus is a few hours slower and not guaranteed to pick you up once you cross the Georgian border, so minibus is preferable.\n\n\nBy boat\nSee also: Ferries in the Caspian Sea\nThere is no ferry or cruise service with any other country on the Caspian Sea. Be forewarned that the much talked about \"ferries\" on the Caspian are simply cargo ships with some extra space to take on passengers. Getting a ride on one of these \"ferries\" is no easy task. First you must find the notoriously difficult to find ticket office, which basically keeps track of ship which are departing. If you manage to find the ticket office and manage to get a booking, you still have little idea of when the ship will depart. Give them a phone number to reach you and be prepared, they may call you an hour or two prior to departure... two days after the first departure the office gave you and the day before the second departure date they gave you! This is only the first of you troubles. After paying for your place on the boat (about US$50\u2013100), the captain and perhaps other crew members will expect an additional amount to get a bed and a shower. You are expected to bring your own food. The crossing will only take 1 day (Turkmenistan) or 2\u20133 days (Kazakhstan). Most ships go to Turkmenistan, where ships must wait for an open berth... so you can wait 2\u20135 days on the boat just waiting for a place to dock! Unless you are on a very small budget or have a bike and especially if you are on a short timeschedule, you should pay twice as much (~US$200\u2013250) for a one way airfare to Kazakhstan, Russia, or Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus or marshrutka\nBuses and marshrutkas (aka minibus aka converted delivery van) connect most cities. There is often a hub such as a bus station near the bazaar in these cities.\nMarshrutkas are quite crowded on the intra-city routes in Azerbaijan. It is common for 15 people to crowd into a 10-person marshrutka, and do not feel shy in doing this. It is normal, if you are standing, for someone to take your bag and hold onto it until either you or they disembark. Men usually ride in the rear of buses and marshrutkas, while women sit in the front, and it is customary for men to give their seat to a lady entering the bus. Lastly, Azerbaijan is not a queue-forming society, and this especially applies to bus and marshrutkas.\nA common rule of thumb for bus rates in Azerbaijan seems to be about 1 manat per hour ride or for every 40-50 km\u2014everything else is touristic overcharge, stand your ground and get the help of other passengers.\n\n\nBy train\nWith a few exceptions, trains in Azerbaijan are night trains that connect Baku with distant regions of the country. There is also a daily fast train to Ganja, daily slow train to Shirvan and a frequent suburban train to Sumqavit. Timetables here: https://ady.az/az/tables/index/52/44 The international Nakhichivan - Mashad train can used for trip within the Nakhichivan exclave: https://ady.az/az/news/read/312/43\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxies require some negotiating skills. But using a calculator (smartphone!) to agree on a price works.\nMost taxi drivers simply double the price for tourists. So, halving it while negotiating and doing the walk-away trick, should reveal the genuine price. (Doubling a price is seemingly much easier than tripling it.) Otherwise, just use Bolt (a taxi app for your mobile and widely used in cities around Azerbaijan) as indicator or/and negotiator, or just book through it.\nGeneral prices are \u2153\u2013\u00bd manat/km. It gets cheaper (per km) the longer the ride.\nWith Bolt (or others), you can even book a taxi for trips far away from the big cities in which it is offered, as long as you start from where it is offered, e.g. Ganja to Tbilisi for 70 manat, or Baku to Shamakhi for 40 manat, i.e. even crossing border. But make sure the taxi driver actually understand what he is willing to do there. However, the trips out of larger cities can be time efficiently, since you do not have to head to several bus stations, etc. first before you finally get the long distance ride. This way, you take a taxi to the road frequented by the long distance options and simply take you continuing ride there.\nRide-hailing is available in Azerbaijan. The most anticipated provider is Bolt, which works in Baku, Ganja and Sumgayit.\n\n\nBy car\nAzerbaijan is a country with a high number of road accidents\u2014traffic rules are often not respected. The poor state of the roads and the lack of lighting make it advisable to avoid driving after dark. The drink-drive limit is zero.\n\nHighway kilometers overview:\n\ntotal: 36,700 km\npaved: 31,800 km (includes some all-weather gravel-surfaced roads)\nunpaved: 1,900 km (These roads are made of unstabilized earth and are difficult to negotiate in wet weather.)\nNote that Baku and Azerbaijan in general have many automated speed cameras, and it is not uncommon to get a ticket\u2014which will be sent via SMS directly to the car owner. So, don't be surprised when you have to pay a little extra when giving back the car. Locals say, 60 manat for a weekend trip is not uncommon.\n\n\nBy rental car\nDue to remote location of many sights and scarcity of attractions in this otherwise huge country, it can be meaningful to rent a car. The most common rental company is the Azeri AZNUR, which competes well on prices with the big international companies. A budget car for 4 days starts from US$100 with a deposit of US$150. Be cautious when using the common price comparison sites for rental cars. They often try to sell you overpriced full coverage insurances or charge other unnecessary fees right before confirming the booking, especially via mobile and when not being attentive in reading the conditions.\n\n\nBy thumb\nAs a man hitchhiking is generally possible and easy. However, sometimes to often people expect a little money for taking you along the way, pretty much like in Iran. A woman on its own on the other hand will cause confusion and potentially unexpected behaviour, and should therefore be not undertaken.\n\n\nOn foot and navigation\nAzerbaijan is an excellent place for hiking and trekking, providing many interesting trails. The Caucasus, G\u00f6yg\u00f6l National Park, Quba or Khinalug, just to name some destinations. However, due to the often remote nature of these trails, it is important that you are well prepared and have a proper and reliable map with you. In addition, using GPS adds an extra layer of safety, both in cities as well as the countryside. For reliable (offline) maps and comprehensive trails and map information, consult OpenStreetMap, which is also used by this travel guide, and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd (complex with many add-ons) and MAPS.ME (easy but limited).\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Azerbaijani phrasebook, Russian phrasebook\nThe official language of Azerbaijan is Azeri or Azerbaijani, spoken by 90-95% of the population. Azeri is a Turkic language that shares a high degree of mutual intelligibility with Turkish; therefore, Turkish speakers should have no problems with getting around in the country. \nRussian is spoken by the vast majority of people and it is widely considered the lingua franca of the country. \nEnglish is not that widely spoken, but it is gradually becoming a more popular foreign language. You're more likely to find an English speaker in Baku.\n\n\nSee\n\nThere are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country; The walled city of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower as well as the Rock Art Cultural Landscape of Gokustan.\nNeft Da\u015flar\u0131 \u2013 City above the sea, the first operating offshore oil platform in the world, located 55 km from the nearest shore in the Caspian Sea.\nMud volcanoes which spout up in over 300 locations nationwide, constitute more than half the total throughout the world, each site with its own character\nCaspian Hyrcanian forests found near the Iranian border\nTears of Kyapaz a string of seven idyllic mountain lakes near Mount Kyapaz and Nagorno-Karabakh\nSeaside resorts located along the Caspian coastline\n\n\nDo\nHang around in a smoky tea house, have a pivo or tea, and play dominoes.\nTry to attend an Azerbaijani wedding\nContrary to reports, Azeri wine is more than drinkable, and whilst not as tasty as their Georgian or Armenian counterparts, is still a pleasant treat!

(ISO currency code: AZN). It is divided into 100 gapiz. Wikivoyage will use manat in its articles to denote the currency.\nThe \"old\" manat was replaced by the \"New Azerbaijani manat\" on 1 January 2007, so do not accept old manat. New banknotes of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 manat and metal coins of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 manat and 50 gapik (0.5 manat) circulate. The banknotes are of a uniform design somewhat reminiscent of euro banknotes since the same designer worked on both sets.\nManat and Georgian lari can be changed in towns near the border, and in Georgia.\n\n\nEat\n\nAzeri cuisine (az\u0259rbaycan m\u0259tb\u0259xi) might not seem diverse to Western Europeans, but it is worth trying. Most of the dishes contain a lot of meat (including fat) and vegetables. Bread is a staple, and is quite revered by the people of Azerbaijan.\nPiti is a national dish. It is made with mutton and vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, chickpeas), infused with saffron water to add flavour and colour, all covered by a lump of fat, and cooked in a sealed crock. Worth trying \u015e\u0259ki version of this dish (boiled chestnuts are used instead of potato), if you are there.\nCabbage, grape leaves, and eggplant wrapped meat (kelem, yarpaq, badimjan - dolmasi), kabab (kebab), rice with different variety of toppings (plov - It is said that plov is the king of Azerbaijani cuisine), gutabs and meatballs (kufta) are some of the several specialties of Azerbaijan. Yarpaq dolmasi is often considered to be the national dish.\nGeorgian food, in particular khachapuri (a cheese-filled bread), along with some Russian staples (borsh, crepes/bliny) have become common throughout Azerbaijan. Other cuisines such as Turkish, Italian, Asian, and American fast food, can be found in the biggest cities.\nThere are several soups that you might want to try: bozbash, buglama, ashgara (lamb with chestnut). Try \u00c7oban qovurma (lamb stew with vegetables).\n\n\nDrink\nSome local drinks include ayran (a yoghurt drink based on sour milk) and sherbet (made from rose petals or saffron). There are also different sorts of quite decent wines produced from local grapes and a wide array of mineral waters from natural springs.\nIn some areas of Azerbaijan the markets offer lemonades (limonat/dushes) made from pears or tarragon.\nNote: In general, it is forbidden for females to enter tea houses and drinking establishments. Drinking in general is also taboo for women in rural Azerbaijan. It's not a problem in Baku.\n\n\nSleep\nThere is a good selection of hotels in Baku, including many Western European chains, but options elsewhere in the country are limited but nevertheless growing. Prices for the hotels start from US$60. Rental apartments might be a good choice as they are cheaper than hotels and sometimes are even more comfortable.\nSince many hostel-like places and guest-houses are popping up rapidly and randomly everywhere in the country (like in Sheki and Ganja), they are often poorly signposted, and from the outside a great hostel might look like an ordinary apartment. Hence, make sure beforehand to get a detailed description (including GPS) of where to find the place and which apartment to ring at. Otherwise, you might be lost forever and even locals won't know where this newly popped up place is.\n\n\nLearn\nYou can get the information you need about Azerbaijan from the hotels where you will stay. They have different guides for Azerbaijan. Also at some new bus stations in Baku there are maps of the capital.\n\n\nWork\nThe developing economy of Azerbaijan is in dire need of highly qualified personnel. But nevertheless, the immigration laws here are extremely strict, and it will not work just like that if you are not a highly qualified specialist or businessman invited by a local company or organization. There are practically no ordinary labor migrants and immigrants from other countries in Azerbaijan, with the exception of rare people from southern Russia (for example, from Dagestan), Eastern Turkey and ethnic Azerbaijanis from neighboring Iran. There are qualified experts and businessmen from developed countries in Azerbaijan, but they are not enough for such an economy.\nThere is unemployment and low wages in Azerbaijan itself, and many citizens of this country go to work in Russia (over 1.5 million people) and Turkey (over 500 thousand people), as well as to other countries. The average salary in the regions of the country is $300.\n\n\nStay safe\nRobbing and pickpocketing in the capital Baku, especially in poor and sparsely populated areas is possible but rare and is higher across the capital at night. Common sense is useful as in all other countries. Also watch your stuff in public transport.\nCriminals posing as police officers have sometimes stopped foreigners and stolen documents and money. If you are stopped on the street by a person in a police uniform, be cooperative but ask to see a badge or ID card.\n\n\nCorruption\nAzerbaijan is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. \nCorruption is widespread. But as a foreigner you have a fairly strong position in refusing to pay \"h\u00f6rmet\" (bribe). Never give any bribe. Often Azeris are so ashamed of their corrupt economy, that they might hide it from you anyway.\n\n\nPhotography\nAlthough the country has a myriad of fantastic photo opportunities, it is illegal to take photographs of anything of strategic importance, i.e., military sites and equipment. If you are in doubt, simply ask.\n\n\nDangerous areas\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has fought wars with Armenia. Fighting took place again in September 2022. Many governments advise against travelling to Nagorno-Karabakh, its surrounding areas, and areas near the border with Armenia. Some areas may contain high amounts of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and landmines. Generally speaking, you have little reason to go to areas near the Armenia-Azerbaijan border as those areas have nothing that interests tourists.\n\n\nLGBT travellers\nAlthough homosexuality was decrminalised in 2000, homophobia is widespread in Azerbaijan. The cultural and societal abhorrence against the LGBT community is far-reaching.\nThere are no laws in place to protect the rights of LGBT people and same-sex marriages are formally banned in the country. \nIf you are LGBT, it is strongly recommended that you do not exhibit your sexuality in public; openly displaying your orientation may invite harsh words or at worst, violence.\n\n\nSafety tips\nWhen outside of the city, try to travel during the day time, unless you take a night train. The roads can be treacherous at night due to unseen potholes and dimly lit cars.\n\n\nEmergency contact numbers\nAmbulance: 103\nFire: 101\nGas Emergency: 104\nSpeaking Clock: 106\nPolice: 102\nYou must speak in Azeri, Turkish or Russian to communicate your needs. It would be a good idea to memorize key phrases before coming to Azerbaijan - see the Talk section for phrasebooks.\n\n\nStay healthy\nMake sure your diphtheria, tetanus, and Hepatitis A & B immunizations are up to date. Malaria is a risk in lowland Azerbaijan, particularly around the border with Iran. Anti-malarials are not a must for Baku, but the risk is present in rural areas not far from the city.\nWater should not be consumed unless from a sealed bottle. Bottled soft drinks or boiled drinks, such as tea or coffee, also reduce risks.\n\n\nCope\nToilets at bus stations charge 0.20-0.40 manat.\n\n\nRespect\n\nAzerbaijanis are a very reserved but very polite and well-mannered people.\n\nWhen you are invited into an Azerbaijani home, make sure to bring them a gift. Anything is fine from flowers (be sure to get an odd number of flowers, as an even number is associated with funerals), to chocolate (but not wine and other alcoholic beverages), and indeed something representative from your country. In Azerbaijani culture it is the thought behind the gift, rather than the price, that matters.\nWhen you arrive at the house take off your shoes just outside or immediately inside the door, unless the owner explicitly allows you to keep them on. Even then, it might be more polite to remove your shoes. You may be offered slippers to wear.\nAzerbaijanis respect elderly people, so in a bus, tram, subway and in other forms of public transportation, young(er) people will always offer you a place to sit if you are an old(er) person as well as a handicapped person or a pregnant woman or have children with you. It is considered polite to let women be the first to board and leave the bus, tram, subway and in other forms of public transportation or to enter and leave a room.\nIt is respectful to bend slightly (not a complete bow) when greeting someone older or in a position of authority. Younger people always initiate greetings with older people or those in a position of authority.\nIf you do not know the person well, use their first name followed by an appropriate honorific. For women, use Xan\u0131m \u2013 pronounced \"hanm\" (\"Mrs.\"). For men, use C\u0259nab \u2013 pronounced \"jenab\" (\"Mr\"). If they do speak English use their last name preceded by the appropriate English honorific \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\". The English honorific \"Ms.\" does not exist in the Azerbaijani language.\nWomen are traditionally treated with respect and chivalry. Female travellers should not be surprised or alarmed if their male Azeri friends take the initiative to pay the bills at a restaurant, open every door in front of them, or help them carry items or objects. Male travellers should understand that these nuances will be expected by Azeri women, even if you're not in a romantic relationship with one.\n\n\nThings to avoid\n\n\nPolitics\nDo not insult or speak badly of the Aliyev family. This is punishable by imprisonment.\nDo not mention or have a discussion about the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Almost every Azerbaijani family has at least one member among the thousands that have been killed in or internally displaced by the conflict. Discussing it can very easily arouse strong emotions so approach the subject with respect and caution.\nDo not mention or have a discussion about Armenia. Feelings of hatred against Armenians are widespread in Azerbaijan.\nAvoid photographing railways, subway stations, and other objects which the authorities may think to be of \"strategic\" importance. Foreign railway buffs have been reportedly detained by the authorities on suspicion of espionage.\nBe careful when having a discussion about Iran. Many Azerbaijanis regard Iranian Azerbaijan to be Azerbaijani territory under Iranian occupation.\n\n\nReligion\nEven though 95% of the population is nominally Shiite Muslim, Azerbaijan is a strictly secular state and by and large an agnostic and non-religious nation. This is true both in large cities as well as in villages and rural areas. Despite seeing themselves as Muslims, Azeri men often drink alcoholic beverages, and this is widely accepted, probably due to the Russian and Soviet legacy. Still, drinking is rare among women and almost never occurs between men and women in rural areas or socially conservative families. Unrest in Iran, Iraq and Syria in the 21st century has made the government very strict about religious clothing and symbols and prompted greater secularization and stricter control of the southern borders. Any religious signs, flags, slogans in public and proselytizing (missionary activity) for any religion are prohibited by law. Any violation will result in fines, imprisonment, and in case of foreigners, deportation from the country. Don't assume that anyone you do not know believes in God or has a passion for Islam or other faiths. Investigations into people's faith is largely unwelcome, and outside places of worship, displays of your faith should be kept private. Saying grace for example, is likely to be met with bewilderment and silence. Religious attire such as Muslim headscarves, Kippahs or even T-shirts with religious slogans, will \u2013 while tolerated \u2013 also make many Azerbaijanis feel uncomfortable. However, it is acceptable to wear small necklaces with religious symbols. Those with long beards may arouse the suspicion of the authorities.\n\n\nSocial custom and etiquette breaches\nDon't blow your nose during meals, even discreetly.\nDon't pick your teeth during meals, even discreetly.\nDon't put your feet up while sitting and try not to show the bottom of your feet to someone.\nDon't point with your finger at someone.\nDon't chew gum while having a conversation and during public occasions.\nIt is better not to touch someone without permission.\nDon't bear hug or back slap someone, especially in formal situations and occasions and with someone you just met and/or you do not know well enough.\nDon't raise your voice or shout in public, especially on public transportation.\nDon't use swear words during conversation or while talking to oneself in public and also among friends.\n\n\nOther things to watch for\nDon't smile at a stranger in the street: they will not only think you are odd, but may feel insulted. Smiling is traditionally reserved for family and friends; smiling at a stranger without addressing them, will be interpreted as your making fun of them or that there is something wrong with their clothes or hair. However, a sincere polite smile when addressing a person is appropriate and will be appreciated (an automatic \"Western smile\", grinning, is widely regarded as insincere). Smiling is still very rare in customer service, as sales assistants, public servants and the like are expected to look serious and businesslike. Even show hosts very rarely smile. Hence the very common misconception about Azerbaijanis is that they are a cold people and never smile \u2013 they do, once they get to know you, and become very welcoming and kind.\nPublic displays of affection in larger cities and tourist resorts are tolerated but might invite unnecessary stares from the public. In more rural areas they are frowned upon and are to be avoided. Gay and lesbian travellers should avoid any outward signs of affection.\nYou will notice how Azerbaijanis tend to keep their voices down in public places. Do not raise your voice in a conversation. A decent silent conversation is the Azerbaijani way of doing business and will be much appreciated. Talking on a mobile phone on public transportation and in restaurants is considered normal, unless the conversation is loud and too \"private\".\nLittering is considered to be very bad manners and you may be fined. There are many waste containers and trash cans on the sidewalks and near most stores.\n\n\nGay and lesbian travellers\nHomosexuality is no longer criminalized in Azerbaijan, but the negative stigma is still strong throughout the country. Same-sex relationships are not recognized by the government or accepted by society, and showing your sexual orientation openly is very likely to draw stares and whispers. The few establishments geared towards homosexuals are almost exclusively in Baku and are mostly underground. Azerbaijan is not the happiest place in the world for LGBT travellers; be quite cautious if travelling as an LGBT traveller.\n\n\nConnect\nFor numbers given in the form (0cc)xxx xx xx, the \"0\" is the trunk prefix and cc the area code. To call from abroad, dial +994ccxxxxxxx. For calling in the country, dial 0ccxxxxxxx, or from local landlines xxxxxxx.\nThere are three mobile operators: Azercell, Bakcell, Nar Mobile, Azerfon-Vodafone.\n\nAzercell is the largest one. To dial an Azercell number you need to dial (050) or (051) and then the number. Only with Azercell can you talk in the metro (subway) in Baku.\nNar Mobile is pretty cheap but doesn't work in some regions. For dialing Nar Mobile numbers you need to dial (070) and then the number.\nAzerfon-Vodafone is new operator have 3G. For dialing Azerfon-Vodafone numbers you need to dial (077) and then the number.\nBakcell is ok. It works almost everywhere and is cheaper that Azercell. To dial a Bakcell number you need to dial (055) and then the number.\nThe numbers have a \"0\" + 2 digit code (different for each operator) + 7 digits number. For example (050)xxx xx xx, (051)xxx xx xx, or (055)xxx xx xx, or (070)xxx xx xx, or (077)xxx xx xx. Remove the zero when using the +994 prefix.\nYou can buy cards for use with different operators almost in every store.\n\n\nArea codes\nThe area codes were changed to two figures in 2011. Baku, Sumqayit and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic kept their area codes (12, 18 and 36, respectively), other areas have area codes in the range 20\u201326.",
