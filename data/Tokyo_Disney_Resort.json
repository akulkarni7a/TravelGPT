It is the second most annually-visited theme park complex in the world, behind Walt Disney World. It is noteworthy that it is not owned by The Walt Disney Company but by the Oriental Land Co., Ltd (OLC).\n\n\nUnderstand\n\"To all who come to this happy place, welcome. Here you will discover enchanted lands of fantasy and adventure, yesterday and tomorrow. May Tokyo Disneyland be an eternal source of joy, laughter, inspiration, and imagination to the peoples of the world. And may this magical kingdom be an enduring symbol of the spirit of cooperation and friendship between the great nations of Japan and the United States of America.\"  \u2014 E. Cardon Walker, 15 April 1983\n\"Welcome one and all to a world where imagination and adventure set sail. Tokyo DisneySea is dedicated to the spirit of exploration that lives in each of us. Here we chart a course for adventure, romance, discovery and fun, and journey to exotic and fanciful ports of call. May Tokyo DisneySea inspire the hearts and minds of all of us who share the water planet, Earth.\"  \u2014 Michael D. Eisner, 4 September 2001\n\nTokyo Disney Resort consists of two theme parks. Tokyo Disneyland (\u6771\u4eac\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9), a \"Magic Kingdom\" park just like all the others, was the first Disney theme park to be built on non-U.S. territory. The park opened in April 1983 (but had been finished for a few months and the company waited for better weather) and was an instant success. Tokyo Disneyland's sister park Tokyo DisneySea (\u6771\u4eac\u30c7\u30a3\u30ba\u30cb\u30fc\u30b7\u30fc), which opened in September 2001, is an ocean-themed park exclusive to Japan. With 17.3 million visits in 2014, Tokyo Disneyland is the second most visited theme park in the world behind Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom; DisneySea follows in fourth place with 14.1 million visits.\nTokyo Disney Resort also includes the Ikspiari (\u30a4\u30af\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30ea) shopping and entertainment complex.\nTokyo Disney Resort is something different from all the other Disney parks. People are friendly, but you are reminded that you are in the largest city on Earth as it is very crowded and you can expect huge queues even for the smallest attraction on a normal day.\nThis is no Walt Disney World; in other words, it is small and can be easily tackled in about two or three days, maybe more. Still, whatever effort you place into coming here is well worth it if you like Disney stuff.\n\n\nTalk\nJapanese is the primary language spoken here. However, assistance for English speakers is also widely available, because of the presence of American and other foreign cast members. Chinese and Korean are also spoken to a lesser extent. Still, English is not very widely spoken in Japan, even here.\nDo not expect all cast members (ride attendants) to speak English.  Most communication when getting on and off rides is done by sign language, which seems to be standard across all attractions.\nMaps are available in Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese. (The English map will work fine.) All the maps are fine, however the Japanese maps are a little more informative. They include highlights on some of the special events going on in the park, including special food menus and merchandise, most of which can be had for only a limited amount of time.\nThey also sort the restaurants, shops and shows into different categories. If you know katakana, hiragana, and a little bit of kanji, this might also be a helpful resource. Nearly any park attendant should have maps available if you lose your map or forget to pick one up.\nSome rides like the Jungle Cruise are rendered almost meaningless to non-Japanese speakers. You can try and laugh along to avoid embarrassment if you like. Some other attractions, like MicroAdventure! (known as \"Honey, I Shrunk The Audience\" at Disney's American parks) have English translations with headphones in the back row: make sure you get to the front of the queue or you may miss out on yours.\nSpecial stage shows may be entirely in Japanese, entirely in English, or in a mixture of both. It is difficult to ascertain what language a show will be in or whether translations are provided before you get to see it. Signs in English outside a show are no guarantee that it will be in English or that translations will be provided.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nMany international visitors would probably land at Narita International Airport (NRT IATA). If you have a Mickey Mouse urge right upon landing, there are buses operated by Airport Limousine, albeit infrequent, that will bring you to Tokyo Disney Resort in 60-90 min at a cost of \u00a52400 (children \u00a51200). The alternative by rail is to take the Narita Express to Tokyo and transfer to the JR Keiyo Line. The ride takes 90\u2013100 minutes and costs \u00a52570 or can be boarded free with the Japan Rail Pass. The cheapest way is to take the Keisei Narita Sky Access to Higashi Matsudo, then transfer to JR Musashino Line and alight at Maihama. The total journey time is about 70 minutes and costs about \u00a51250.\nTokyo International Airport (HND IATA), also known as Haneda Airport, is the closest airport to Tokyo Disney Resort and mainly serves domestic flights, but is accepting a growing number of international flights from all over the world. There are more buses [1], also operated by Airport Limousine, that run to the resort 3 to 5 times per hour. The one-way cost is \u00a5810 (children \u00a5405) and the ride takes 50-70 min.\nThe rail alternative from Haneda is cheaper than the bus, but you will need to take three trains: Keikyu Express Line (from Haneda Airport to Shinagawa) or the Tokyo Monorail (from Haneda Airport to Hamamatsucho), JR Yamanote Line (from Shinagawa/Hamamatsucho to Tokyo), and finally JR Keiyo Line (from Tokyo to Maihama). This costs \u00a5690 via Keikyu, or \u00a5760 via the Tokyo Monorail, and will take about 1 hour.\n\n\nBy train\nMap of JR East Railway Lines in Greater Tokyo [2]\nAs with virtually all of the rest of Japan, the most practical way of getting to Tokyo Disney Resort is by train. Tokyo Station is the western terminus of the JR Keiyo Line, and Maihama (\u821e\u6d5c), which is adjacent to the park, is the sixth stop east. The ride costs \u00a5210 and takes about 15 min on an express train.\nAs you exit JR Maihama Station,  the Tokyo Disney Resort Welcome Center is immediately to your left. If you will be staying at one of the Disney Hotels or the Tokyo Disney Resort Official Hotels (see Sleep below), this is where you check in, and your luggage will be shipped straight to your room for free while you enjoy the parks. The Welcome Center is also the place to purchase park tickets, the Resort Gateway Station of the Disney Resort Line monorail (see Get around below) is above the center, and the entrance to Ikspiari is nearby.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom the Tokyo/Yokohama region, follow the coast of Tokyo Bay to Chiba, exit at the Urayasu ramp and then go out at Route 357, go straight on the road about 1 km, and make a U-turn at Mihama Rittai Road (\u7f8e\u6d5c\u7acb\u4f53\u9053\u8def). There are signs in both Japanese and English from the freeway and surrounding roads.\nTokyo Disney Resort has ample parking spaces, but be forewarned that parking fees are astronomical. If you want more information about the car park and the circumstances of the surrounding streets, you can contact the Tokyo Disney Resort information line at 81-45-683-3011.\nParking at the two theme parks is \u00a52,000 for passenger cars, \u00a54,500 for buses, and \u00a5500 for motorcycles.\nParking at Ikspiari is \u00a5500 for the first hour and \u00a5250 for every additional half-hour. A purchase of \u00a51,500 or more at one Ikspiari shop/restaurant will give one hour of free parking (up to 6 hours with total purchases of \u00a530,000); seeing a movie at AMC Ikspiari will give three hours of free parking.\nThe three Disney Hotels charge a per-night fee for the use of their parking facilities, costing \u00a52,000 for the first night and \u00a52,000 for every additional night.\n\n\nBy bus\nMost visitors will have little reason to travel to Tokyo Disney Resort by bus, due to the more convenient JR Keiyo Line. However, some hotels around Tokyo Disney Resort have free transportation service to the resort.\nLong-distance bus services come here from all over Japan, but the Shinkansen is much easier to use by non-native speakers of Japanese or persons who do not understand the language and also much faster.\n\n\nTickets\nTicket prices seem decent by Japanese standards, but visiting Tokyo Disney Resort is really about as equally expensive as visiting any of the other Disney theme parks around the world. Children aged 3 and under are admitted free.\n\n 1-Day Passport: You can enter Tokyo Disneyland or Tokyo DisneySea all day long with this ticket but not both.\nAdult (18+) \u00a59,900\nJunior (12-17) \u00a58,200\nChild (4-11) \u00a55,600\nMulti Day Passport: You can enter one park on the first day, the other park on the second day, and then you may move between the two parks (called \"park-hopping\") on subsequent days. If you find that you need to upgrade your ticket, you can do so simply by paying the difference; this may be done at the Welcome Center, the park ticket windows, or the hotels. These are perhaps the most economical value possible, as the price per day actually decreases with each day.\n\nStarlight Passport: You can use this ticket in one of the two parks from 15:00 on Saturdays, Sundays, and National Holidays.\nAdult (18+) \u00a54,900\nJunior (12-17) \u00a54,300\nChild (4-11) \u00a53,400\nAfter 6 Passport: You can use this ticket in one of the two parks from 18:00 on weekdays. It is sold from 17:00 for \u00a53300 (all ages).\n\n\nGet around\n\nA car is not required for get around the Tokyo Disney Resort. The resort has a well-developed transit system of buses and monorails. As with the rest of Japan, expect the transportation to be punctual.\n\n\nBy monorail\n\nThe four-station Disney Resort Line monorail, with its spacious interiors and Mickey Mouse-shaped windows and pull straps, travels in a counterclockwise circle around the two theme parks. The stops are, in order, Resort Gateway Station (between JR Maihama Station and Ikspiari), Tokyo Disneyland, Bayside Station (gateway to the Tokyo Disney Resort Official Hotels), and Tokyo DisneySea.\nThe fares are listed in the chart below; children age 5 and under ride free. Suica and PASMO farecards can also be used.\n\n\nBy foot\nIf you are going straight to the parks from Maihama Station, it is probably easier and faster (and best of all, free) to just walk from the station. There is an elevated walkway, about 1,090 ft (330 m) long, linking the station with the Tokyo Disneyland entrance. To get to Tokyo DisneySea, it is about a fifteen minute walk in the opposite direction. Simply walk along the wide tree-lined footpath in front of Ikspiari, then turn right and follow the monorail line after you pass under it, and enter via the pedestrian entrance to the bus dropoff area.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe Disney Resort Cruiser is a free bus service.\n\nFrom Bayside Station on the Disney Resort Line, service is to the each of the six Tokyo Disney Resort Official Hotels.\nFrom Disney Ambassador Hotel, service is to both theme parks.\n\n\nSee and do\n\nTokyo Disney Resort is mostly for doing, not seeing. But of course, you can see the same Disney characters, castle, mountains, and live performances like at other Disney Parks. The seaside does make this park a bit different from the others. And, the people-watching is great.\nIf you can, it is a good idea to get a map ahead of time and plan out what rides and attractions you would like to get to first. Like any other large amusement park, Tokyo Disney Resort can be quite crowded. Even on weekdays, there can be a large number of people in the park and if you want to maximize your experience, it's best to have at least an idea of what you would like to do before you get there.  It may even get you on one or two more attractions. If a physical map cannot be had ahead of time, the park website is just as good, if not better.\n\n\nThe parks\nThe two theme parks, Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, complement each other. The two major symbols, Cinderella Castle at Disneyland and Mount Prometheus at DisneySea, are exactly the same height, and from Ikspiari you can see them both.\nBefore you reach the ticket counters, your bag will be inspected by a clerk, but you do not need to show ID. Generally, the check is very brief and not at all thorough. At the ticket counter, you will not need to show ID either. While not everyone speaks English fluently, most employees understand enough to get you the basics. You will receive a receipt, your passport (ticket) and a map.\nTokyo Disney Resort uses a time-saving tool called FastPass, available only for the most popular rides. Simply insert your ticket into a machine at the ride, and you'll get a FastPass ticket with a return time printed on it. If you return to the ride during the time on the FastPass (usually a time frame of an hour), you will have a shorter wait for the ride. You can have only one FastPass at a time, you can't FastPass another ride until two hours after you received your last FastPass. It's a good idea to always get your next FastPass when it becomes available. If you wish to use FastPass, you need to do so as early as possible. Even on regular working days most attractions have given away all FastPasses for the day around noon. They cover the machines afterward and then you will have no choice but to stand in the long lines.\nVisit the Screening Room  on Tokyo Disney Resort's website for a collection of short videos showing all of the attractions in both parks.\n\n\nTokyo Disneyland\n\nTokyo Disneyland is a \"Magic Kingdom\" park just like all the others. Fans of Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom may be a little bit disappointed, as the layout is nearly identical, right down to Cinderella Castle.\nThe seven theme lands of Tokyo Disneyland are, starting from the main entrance and going clockwise around Cinderella Castle, World Bazaar (it's known as Main Street, USA everywhere else; and this version is covered by a Victorian-style iron-and-glass canopy), Adventureland, Westernland, Critter Country, Fantasyland, Toontown, and Tomorrowland. With just a solitary exception, the attractions are essentially the same as those found everywhere else.\n\n Western River Railroad (Adventureland). Tokyo Disneyland's railroad makes a sightseeing trip around Adventureland, Westernland, and Critter Country. It cannot be used to travel from one area of the park to another. \n The Castle. Cinderella Castle at the center of Disneyland is icon and dominating feature of the resort. This is a 51-meter-tall fairy tale castle. While the cynic will notice the stark plastic construction, the castle's fascination cannot be denied by anybody who grew up with Disney style comics. (updated Apr 2017)\n\n\nTokyo DisneySea\n\nTokyo DisneySea, which opened in 2001, is an ocean-themed park exclusive to Japan. Like Tokyo Disneyland, it is arranged in a circle around a central landmark, in this case Mount Prometheus, an artificial volcano that \"erupts\" intermittently. There are a couple of rides that have a water spray, but you shouldn't expect to get too wet.\nStarting from the main entrance and going clockwise around Mount Prometheus, the eight themed \"ports of call\" are Mediterranean Harbor (a reproduction of Venice), American Waterfront (a reproduction of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States), Port Discovery (a science-themed area), Lost River Delta (a reproduction of a tropical rain forest), Arabian Coast (based on Disney's Aladdin), Mermaid Lagoon (based on Disney's The Little Mermaid), Mysterious Island (based on the books of Jules Verne) and Fantasy Springs (featuring attractions and experiences from Frozen, Tangled and Peter Pan).\nAside from the Tower of Terror (which can also be found at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Walt Disney Studios Paris) in American Waterfront and the Indiana Jones Adventure (which can also be found at the original Disneyland in California) in Lost River Delta, all of the attractions in DisneySea are unique to Japan.\n\n\nDisney Premier Access\nDisney Premier Access is a paid queue system used at the Tokyo Disney Resort. The system allows guests to pay to avoid long lines at attractions or access dedicated seating areas for select shows on which the system is offered. Guests select or are offered a designated return time window, when they arrive at the dedicated Premier Access entrance to utilize their Disney Premier Access reservation. It is accessible through the official Tokyo Disney Resort app on iOS and Android devices.\n\n\nBuy\n\nTokyo Disney Resort is a Disney merchandise fan's paradise. Of course, there are plenty of gift shops found within the two parks, but additional selections may be found in Ikspiari and the nearby Bon Voyage store.\nThe World Bazaar, Tokyo Disneyland's entrance area, is anchored by the Grand Emporium, which can be seen to your right immediately after you have entered the park. This is the largest store in the park with over 3,000 different types of merchandise.\nThe largest store in Tokyo DisneySea is Emporio which anchors Mediterranean Harbor. Other notable shops are McDuck's Department Store in American Waterfront; and The Sleepy Whale Shoppe, Mermaid Treasures, and Kiss de Girl Fashions, three interconnecting shops in Mermaid Lagoon.\nIkspiari, pronounced like \"experience\" without the last syllable, is Japan's answer to Walt Disney World's Disney Springs and Disneyland's Downtown Disney, with more than 140 stores and restaurants, and a 16-screen movie theatre. It's no surprise that there is a Disney Store here, by the way.\nBon Voyage, shaped like a giant suitcase and hatbox and conveniently located on the elevated walkway linking JR Maihama Station with Tokyo Disneyland's entrance, is the answer to the World of Disney stores in Florida and California, which essentially are Disney Stores on steroids. Inside, you'll find the grandest selection of Disney merchandise available under one roof anywhere in Japan.\nMajor credit cards are accepted nearly everywhere. Remember that American cards can only be charged once for a purchase, meaning that a \u00a510,000 purchase will be charged once, instead of \u00a55,000 now and \u00a55,000 next month. (Without this, Japanese cards act like charge cards where the purchase has to be completely paid off the next month) Employees will ask you (sometimes) if you want to be charged once. Say yes and the transaction will go smoothly, but say no and you will double your time at the counter.\nSimilar to the now-defunct Disney Dollars at the Disney Parks in the United States, Tokyo Disney Resort offers their own version of Disney Dollars in the form of Gift Certificates used throughout the resort. They come in one denomination (\u00a51,000).\nIf you haven't brought enough money, there is one bank branch with ATMs near the entrance of Tokyo Disneyland and one set of unstaffed ATMs near the entrance of Tokyo DisneySea. The branch with ATMs near the World Bazaar at Disneyland take foreign credit and debit cards and can do withdrawals in multiples of \u00a510,000, for a fee of \u00a5110 to withdraw \u00a510,000 or \u00a5220 to withdraw \u00a520,000 or more (ATM limit \u00a5100,000 per withdrawal, check with your bank as they may have a lower limit). In addition, they can exchange foreign currency, up to \u00a550,000 per person. At Ikspiari, there is an international ATM on level 2F near \"Local Motion\".\n\n\nEat\n\nYou will have no trouble finding food at Tokyo Disney Resort. There are many places to eat throughout the two parks and Ikspiari, and all are listed on the maps. However, the food descriptions are either not 100% accurate or there is something lost in the translation. Also, understand that portion sizes are different in Japan so a large drink that you ordered may look like a small to you.  This combined with the increase in cost normally expected at an amusement park may hit your pocket book harder than expected.\nIf you are arriving by car/bus you may consider having a cooler in the car and having a picnic.  If you decide to eat in the park, scout out the restaurants before you intend on eating. This will give you a better idea of their menus and the fastest way to get there when it is time to eat.\n\n\nIn the parks\nTokyo Disneyland Restaurants [3] \nTokyo DisneySea Restaurants [4] \nMost dining opportunities in the two theme parks are counter service restaurants, most of which serve Western, Japanese, or Chinese cuisine. If you really want to save cash, though, your best bet may be to stick to the many snack carts scattered all throughout the parks.\nTable service restaurants are also found in the parks but are far less common than counter service restaurants. The finest in-park table service can perhaps be found on board the SS Columbia, the fake ocean liner in Tokyo DisneySea's American Waterfront.\nThe Crystal Palace, on the World Bazaar/Adventureland walkway, is the only buffet in Tokyo Disneyland. Its Tokyo DisneySea counterpart is the Sailing Day Buffet, located in the \"cargo terminal\" adjacent to the SS Columbia.\nTokyo Disneyland has one buffeteria (Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall in Fantasyland), and Tokyo DisneySea has three (Cafe Portofino in Mediterranean Harbor, Horizon Bay in Port Discovery, and Vulcania in Mysterious Island).\n\n\nPriority Seating\nTokyo Disney Resort's restaurants do not accept reservations per se. A Priority Seating booking is essentially a restaurant FastPass. When you make a Priority Seating booking, you will receive a designated time to return to the restaurant, and you will then be seated with a minimal wait. Waiting times may vary, especially during peak periods.\nPriority Seating bookings will be held for no more than 15 min past your designated time frame for a restaurant in either of the two theme parks and no more than 10 min for a restaurant in any one of the three Disney Hotels. Also, capacity is limited and bookings tend to fill up early, and that there may be times when Priority Seating bookings are not available.\nPriority Seating can be booked in person at each applied restaurant, or through the Tokyo Disney Resort Reservation Center at +81-45-683-3333. If you know how to read Japanese, you can also make Priority Seating reservations online using the resort's Japanese website.\nPriority Seating is accepted at the following in-park restaurants:\n\n\nTokyo Disneyland\nBlue Bayou Restaurant (Adventureland)\nEastside Cafe (World Bazaar)\nRestaurant Hokusai (World Bazaar)\n\n\nTokyo DisneySea\nMagellan's (Mediterranean Harbor)\nRestaurant Sakura (American Waterfront)\nRistorante di Canaletto (Mediterranean Harbor)\nSailing Day Buffet (American Waterfront)\nSS Columbia Dining Room (American Waterfront)\n\n\nAt Ikspiari\nIkspiari has a broad range of dining options, one of which is Japan's only Rainforest Cafe.\n\n\nDrink\nMost drinks are soft drinks. Coca-Cola and Kirin sponsor attractions, and are the main soft drinks to be found. Mets (Kirin's \"diet\" brand) beverages may also be available.\nAlcoholic beverages are available at 16 restaurants in Tokyo DisneySea. [5]  Under Japanese law, persons under 20 and those who plan to drive a car are prohibited from consuming alcohol.\n\n\nSleep\nTokyo Disney Resort's combined reservations number is +81-045-683-3333, and is open 09:00-21:00.\nOnline reservations and contact information are available at official websites.\n\n\nWithin the resort\nThere are nine hotels within the resort, all rather expensive.\n\n\nDisney Hotels\n1 Disney Ambassador Hotel (adjacent to Ikspiari). Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00. This hotel is themed to the Art Deco era of the 1930s. \u00a528,000-300,000.   \n2 Tokyo Disneyland Hotel (outside the Tokyo Disneyland entrance). Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00. An opulent Victorian-style hotel with the best view of Tokyo Disneyland on the side. \u00a533,000-500,000.   \n3 Tokyo DisneySea Hotel MiraCosta (within the Mediterranean Harbor area of Tokyo DisneySea). Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00. An Italian-style hotel complete with rooms overlooking Mediterranean Harbor. \u00a533,000-500,000.   \n Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel (within Tokyo DisneySea). The newest hotel at Tokyo DisneySea that opened with Fantasy Springs. The hotel features 419 \"deluxe type\" rooms in the Fantasy Chateau, 56 \"luxury-type\" rooms in the Grand Chateau and two restaurants. \n\n\nOfficial hotels\nThese hotels are accessed by taking the free Disney Resort Cruiser bus service from Bayside Station on the Disney Resort Line monorail (see Get around above).\n\n4 Hilton Tokyo Bay, 1-8 Maihama Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-47-355-5000, fax: +81-47-355-5019. Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00n.  \n5 Hotel Okura Tokyo Bay, 1-8 Maihama Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-47-355-3333, fax: +81-47-355-3366. Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00.  \n6 Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay Hotel, 1-9 Maihama Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-47-355-5555. Check-in: 15:00, check-out: 12:00. 802 spacious guest rooms each with own balcony. A nice hotel overall.  \n7 Tokyo Bay Maihama Hotel First Resort (formerly Sunroute Plaza Tokyo), 1-6 Maihama Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-47-355-1111.  \n8 Tokyo Bay Maihama Hotel, 1-34 Maihama Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-47-355-1222, fax: +81-47-355-6777.  \n\n\nOutside the resort\nBecause of the excellent connection to Tokyo Station, you do not necessarily need to stay in an on-site hotel. Cheaper accommodations off-site do exist, and arriving at the park when it opens is still easily possible.\n\n\nPartner hotels\nThe Tokyo Disney Resort Partner Hotels Program is made up of five hotels located in the Shin-Urayasu area right next to the resort. All of these hotels are located within 1\u20132 km of JR Shin-Urayasu Station, from which Maihama is the first stop in the direction of Tokyo Station. For some it may be easier to get the complimentary shuttle service that runs frequently to and from the Disneyland park entrance.\n\n9 Hotel Emion Tokyo Bay (\u30db\u30c6\u30eb \u30a8\u30df\u30aa\u30f3 \u6771\u4eac\u30d9\u30a4), 1-1-1 Hinode Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-047-304-2727. \n10 Mitsui Garden Hotel Prana Tokyo Bay (\u4e09\u4e95\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3\u30db\u30c6\u30eb \u30d7\u30e9\u30ca\u6771\u4eac\u30d9\u30a4), Akemi 6-2-1, \u260f +81-047-382-3331. \n11 Oriental Hotel Tokyo Bay (\u30aa\u30ea\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\u6771\u4eac\u30d9\u30a4), 1-8-2 Mihama, \u260f +81-047-350-8111. \n Palm & Fountain Terrace Hotel, 7-1-1 Meikai Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-047-353-1234. \n12 Urayasu Brighton Hotel Tokyo Bay, 1-9 Mihama Urayasu-shi, \u260f +81-047-355-7777.  \n\n\nGood Neighbor Hotels\nThere are 15 designated Good Neighbor Hotels  around Tokyo and Chiba that offer free shuttle bus transfers to and from Tokyo Disney Resort.\n\n\nGo next\n\nKasai Rinkai Koen (Sea Life Park) [7] is the first stop from Maihama in the direction of Tokyo Station. Essentially, this is Japan's answer to SeaWorld with an aquarium and a Ferris wheel. The ferris wheel is the biggest in Japan (117 m/385 ft).\nMakuhari Messe Messe is the German word for \"trade fair\", and that is just what to expect at this international convention center. You can get here from JR Kaihin-Makuhari Station, which is the sixth stop from Maihama in the direction of Soga Station.\nSanrio Puroland An indoor theme park centered around Hello Kitty and her friendsand a must for little princesses. You will need to take three trains to get here from Tokyo Station: JR Chuo Line (from Tokyo to Shinjuku), Keio Main Line (from Shinjuku to Chofu), and finally Keio Sagamihara Line (from Chofu to Keio Tama Center). It costs \u00a5710, including the trip from Maihama to Tokyo, and takes about 180 min.\n\n\nSee also\nUniversal Studios Japan\nLEGOLand Japan\nWalt Disney World in Florida.\nThe original Disneyland in California.\nDisneyland Resort Paris.\nHong Kong Disneyland.",
