  "extract": "Folkestone (pronounced: FOKE-stun) is a town on the Kent coast, in the South East of England. It is known for its artworks around the town and good beaches.\n\n\nUnderstand\nFolkestone is a member of the Cinque Ports, having been incorporated as a Corporate Limb of Dover. In 1629 the local inhabitants obtained a licence to build a port, prior to which, fishing boats were entirely reliant upon the natural protection of the natural harbour formed by the Pent Stream.\nAt the end of the 18th century the city became prosperous because of an increase in the fishing and shipping industries and, in the middle of the 19th century, Folkestone was one of the chief resorts of southern England, aided by the construction of the railway line from London. Numerous Victorian Hotels, including \"The Grand\" and \"Metropole\" are testament to this, together with no less than three railway stations.\nSince the 1950s it has fallen into decline due in part to competition from Dover, the advent of the Channel Tunnel (with many new jobs in the area because of it convening in Ashford) and the ubiquitous package holiday. However along with Kent's other seaside towns, it has seen some cultural regeneration in the 2010s including the Triennial arts festival.\nSandgate is a village at the west end of the town which has a popular beach.\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Folkestone website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nThe M20 links Folkestone with Ashford, the A259 runs south along the coast to Hastings and the A20 heads up the coast to Dover.\n\n\nBy train\n\n\nFrom France\n1 Eurotunnel Le Shuttle, Satnav: CT18 8XX (M20 motorway, junction 11), \u260f +44 844 335 3535.

Daily 10AM-4PM (autumn-winter), 10AM-5PM (spring-summer). A very touching memorial dedicated to the men who fought and died in Britain's most desperate hour. Vintage aeroplanes are also on display. Free.   (updated Jun 2020)\n\n2 Channel Tunnel Entrance. Observe from the hills to the northwest of Folkestone - 3 Caesar's Camp or Castle Hill and 4 Crete Road West are good spots - the shuttle trains loading cars and lorries before their undersea trip to France. The Channel Tunnel is described as one of the \"Seven Wonders of the Modern World\". On clear days, you also have a fine view over the English Channel and nearby parts of the French coast. Free. (updated Jun 2020)\n\n5 Elham Valley Line Trust - Railway Museum and Countryside Centre, Peene, CT18 8AZ (Take A20 westbound from M20 junction 12, signposted Newington. After passing under Channel Tunnel rail bridge, turn right and follow brown signs to far side of Newington village.), \u260f +44 1303 273 014, enquiries@elhamvalleylinetrust.org. Sa Su, bank holiday 10AM-5PM. A volunteer-run museum preserving the memory of the long-vanished Elham Valley Railway. Highlights include a magnificently-restored 1930s-era station, an original loco, and a model of the original line. The museum profits from its proximity to the Channel Tunnel, presenting a working scale model of the terminal, and the last remaining tunnel manrider in existence. Adjacent to this is an early 18th-century barn which, moved piece-by-piece from its original location (now buried under the Eurotunnel terminal), displays old farming equipment and other rural artifacts, and is also a space for artisan crafts. Children's miniature railway, model shop and tea room on-site. Adult \u00a33.50, concession \u00a33, child \u00a32.50. (updated Jun 2020)\n6 Folkestone White Horse, enq@whitehorsefolkestone.co.uk. Chalk figure of a horse which overlooks the town. No, it's not an ancient monument; it was commissioned for the millennium celebrations and completed in 2003. Best viewed from afar; Weymouth Road and the car park of Tesco are good specs, but it's visible from much of Folkestone. If you're just passing through to get to the continent, the outbound Eurotunnel terminal has some of the clearest and closest views. (updated Jul 2020)\n Folkestone Artworks. Any time. There are 74 outdoor artworks dotted around the town, promoted by Creative Folkestone. These include an Anthony Gormley statue under the harbour and Richard Woods' bungalows. (updated May 2022)\n\n\nDo\n\n1 Quarterhouse, Mill Bay, CT20 1BN, \u260f +44 1303 760 740 (general), +44 1303 760 750 (box office), info@creativefolkestone.org.uk.

Unusual \"modern Gothic\" caf\u00e9-bar upstair.   (updated Jun 2020)\n2 East Cliff and Warren Country Park, Wear Bay Road, CT19 6BL, \u260f +44 1304 241 806, wccp@dover.gov.uk. Daily dawn-dusk. A large park which becomes progressively wilder the further from town you venture. By the entrance, it's all very civilised: bowling greens, pitch and putt, a play area. But a challenging walk or cycle towards the sea finds you descending through landslipped cliffs and scrubland. This part of the park is a nature reserve and site of special scientific interest (SSSI), home to over 150 bird species and typical coastal plants such as rock sea lavender and samphire. At the bottom of the descent, you can go rockpooling, hunt for fossils or fish in the sea. Free.   (updated Jun 2020)\n3 Sunny Sands Beach, The Stade, CT19 6RB (east of the harbour), \u260f +44 1303 258 594. 24 hours daily.. Home to the annual Folkestone sandcastle competition, this is a rare high-quality sandy beach on a coastline dominated by shingle. As such, space is short supply on hot days. Toilets and nearby food and drink facilities make this a handy place for families. Look out for the statue of a mermaid perched on a rock gazing out to sea. Lifeguard service spring and summer weekends. No dogs May-Oct. Free. (updated Jul 2020)\n4 Folkestone Sports Centre, Radnor Park Avenue, \u260f +44 1303 850 222, mail@folkestonesportscentre.co.uk. Closed. There is a large swimming pool (with a flume) at the sports centre behind Radnor park, where there is also one of Kent's only dry ski-slopes. The centre closed on 31 July 2024 and the company that ran it entered administration. (updated Jan 2021)\n5 Harbour Arm, Harbour Approach Road, CT20 1QQ. Formerly the railway station for the boat trains, the Harbour Arm has been reopened to the public. There are several attractions along its length including many food and drink places.  It is popular in the summer with live music events and sports matches shown on a large screen. Free. (updated May 2022)\n\n\nThe Leas\nSouth-west of the town centre, or if coming from the harbour, west up Marine Parade, 6 The Leas is a clifftop coastal promenade along which you can stroll for about a mile. It's wide and flat, with some landscaping, a bandstand and a number of impressive old hotels. You're high enough to get some superb sea views, and for sure high enough to get buffeted by the Channel winds on blustery days! But on a calm, pleasant evening, there are few better places in Kent to catch a sunset. \nThere are several different attractions alongside the prom:\n\n7 Lower Leas Coastal Park. 24/7. Open all year round, this is a wonderful seaside park containing an amphitheatre that provides free entertainment (mostly music and theatre) all throughout each summertime. Arrive early if you want to find a good seat! There is a large children's adventure play area along the seafront, suitable for most ages. The beaches throughout Kent, including Folkestone and Shepway have won awards for cleanliness and adhere strictly to European water quality standards. GBP 0.   \n8 Ride the Cliff Lift. Closed.

Entertainment venue that, in the age of rock and roll, once pulled the biggest bands in the world. It now subsists on a diet of endless tribute acts and the occasional famous comedian.   (updated Jun 2020)\n\n\nRecommended itinerary\nThere's nothing better than on a warm sunny weekend day in summer than to spend a morning browsing shops in the town centre, take a walk down the Old High Street into the artist's quarter, spill out into the harbour - get some locally caught fish and chips or some wonderful locally-caught seafood from the harbour stalls and then walk to the right over the old railway bridge to the harbour arm, then around the shore to the coastal park, stop by and listen to great live music in the amphitheatre, walk up the Zig-Zag path to the relaxing Leas promenade for some fantastic panoramic views of the coastline. In the evening, visit any of the restaurants in the town or nearby Sandgate and catch a show at the Leas Cliff Hall or in the more intimate Silver Screen Cinema in the town centre (next to Waterstone's bookshop).\n\n\nBuy\nAt the turn of the century, many of the larger chains departed Folkestone for Ashford, being a much larger town and having superior rail connections to London and the continent. But, thanks to the efforts of a visionary charity, Folkestone's retail offering hasn't died; far from it. Creative Folkestone bought up much of the land in the centre and brightened up tired old buildings with vivid colour. The organisation actively encourages artists and craftspeople to relocate their businesses here and, crucially, keeps rents affordable. All this has seen the old town centre transformed into the Creative Quarter; there are around 50 independently-run shops, plus art studios, buzzing caf\u00e9s and office space for the creative economy. The quarter's focus is the pedestrianised 1 Old High Street and the more modern 2 Tontine Street, which both descend towards the sea and meet just shy of the harbour.\n\n\nEat\nThere are a number of cafes in Folkestone, particularly at the top of the Old High Street.\n\n1 Rocksalt, 4-5 Fish Market CT19 6AA, \u260f +44 1303 212070. W-Sa 12:00-15:00, 18:00-21:00, Su 12:00-16:00. An excellent place for seafood. Its prices are fair, and the service superb. There is a terrific view of the sea from every table, and there's a balcony. With four rooms, no dogs. B&B double \u00a390. (updated Aug 2020)\n2 Django's Cafe Bar, 17 Rendezvous St, \u260f +44 1303 256556. It sells a wide range of food, and is great for sitting outside in the summer. \n3 Oriental Buffet, 18-20 Rendezvous St, \u260f +44 1303 227356. All-you-can-eat Chinese food. \n4 Cocomee, 2 Castle Hill Ave, \u260f +44 1303 211128. Large Chinese restaurant with good food. \n5 Papas Fish Restaurant and Takeaway, 110 Sandgate Rd, \u260f +44 1303 242578, info@papasfishrestaurant.co.uk. Excellent fish and chips. Friendly service. (updated May 2016)\n6 The Lift Cafe. Cafe inside the Leas Lift Funicular Railway building with vegan and vegetarian options (updated Jun 2024)\nCountry pubs nearby:\n\n7 The Gatekeeper Inn, Canterbury Road, Etchinghill (Either jnc 11 or jnc 12 on the M20), \u260f +44 1303 864345.

One of the most popular drinking establishments in the town is the former Baptist Galleries building, and before that a Baptist church, now a magnificently restored Wetherspoon pub, complete, some say, with its own resident ghost! (updated May 2022)\n2 Docker, 96 Sandgate High Street. Interesting beers on tap. (updated Sep 2023)\n\n\nSleep\n1 Holiday Inn Express Folkestone - Channel Tunnel, Cheriton High St, CT18 8AN, \u260f +44 1303 298450. On its own on edge of business park but good convenient stop over for channel tunnel and Dover ferries. (updated Apr 2016)\n2 The Grand Burstin Hotel, Marine Parade, \u260f +44 871 222 0048. Built next to the harbour, this hotel has declined somewhat since it was built in the heydays of 1970s. Renovations have however shaped up the hotel to be a good mid-range option. (updated Apr 2017)\n\n\nGo next\nFolkestone has easy access to a number of areas:\n\nAshford - A short trip on the train and Eurostar departure point should it ever restart services.  It is surrounded by the Kent countryside and is possibly best known for the large Ashford Designer Outlet shopping centre which is close to the rail station.\nCanterbury \u2013 the famous pilgrims' cathedral housing Thomas \u00e0 Becket's remains, a museum celebrating Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, a number of Roman things, as well as some decent shops and cafes.\nDover \u2013 famous for its castle and the white cliffs.  If travelling by car, take the old road via Capel-le-Ferne, taking the chance to see the Battle of Britain memorial with its fine views over the channel.\nHythe \u2013 small town with ornamental canal, Port Lympne Wild Animal Park and access to the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch ultra-narrowgauge railway.\nFrance \u2013 zip across the channel to Calais via Eurotunnel and with a car.",
