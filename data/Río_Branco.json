  "extract": "R\u00edo Branco is in the Central Interior of Uruguay, located on the border with Brazil right across from the city of Jaguar\u00e3o.\n\n\nUnderstand\nAppropriately for a border town, the city's name is a mix of languages: r\u00edo with an accent is the Spanish word for \"river\" (in contrast to Portuguese rio), whereas branco is the Portuguese word for white (in contrast to Spanish blanco).\n\n\nGet in\nR\u00edo Branco is located at the end of Route 26. Buses arrive from cities such as Montevideo, Minas, and Treinta y Tres.\nTo get in from Jaguar\u00e3o, across the border in Brazil, just cross the 1 Mau\u00e1 Bridge over the Yaguar\u00f3n River, which does not have border controls. You're free to cross back and forth between the two cities, but if you're coming from Uruguay and want to continue farther into Brazil, or if you're coming from Brazil and want to continue farther into Uruguay, you're required to go through passport controls in both cities, which to make things more confusing and difficult are located some distance away from the border on each side. 2 Uruguayan immigration is on the outskirts of R\u00edo Branco at the end of Bulevar Aparicio Saravia, and 3 Brazilian immigration is located several blocks into Jaguar\u00e3o at Rua J\u00falio de Castilhos 1572.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nGo next\nJaguar\u00e3o, right across the border in Brazil",
