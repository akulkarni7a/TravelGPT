  "extract": "The French Alps are part of the large European chain of mountains known as the Alps.  They are primarily attractive for outdoor activities, such as Alpine Skiing and mountaineering. Less famous but still popular sports, in the region, include mountain bike (cross-country, Downhill), white water rafting and paragliding. The region is also noted for its stunning beauty, including many alpine lakes, the largest being Lake Geneva (Lac Leman), Lac d'Annecy and Lac de Bourget; these lakes are year-round attractions for their beauty and access to numerous water sports.\nThe French portion of the Alps are also home to famous resorts towns Chamonix, St. Gervais, Albertville (1992 Olympic Winter Games), Grenoble (1968 Olympic Winter Games), and  Annecy with its old city and lake. The 2030 Winter Olympics will be held at several locations in the French Alps (as well as Nice and the Italian city of Turin), and will be the first Olympics officially hosted by a region instead of one or tow cities.\n\n\nRegions\n\nAuvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes\nProvence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur\n\n\nMountains\nMont Blanc\nVanoise\n\u00c9crins\nChartreuse\nVercors\nBelledonne\n\n\nGet in\nThe French Alps are well connected to the rest of the country. The nearest international airport is Grenoble Is\u00e8re Airport. Lyon and other cities have a direct TGV (fast train) to Paris. Many towns are also connected by TGV or ordinary trains. There are also highways in many valleys. There is also the international airport of Geneva (Switzerland) nearby.\n\n\nCities\n Albertville (Winter Olympic Games in 1992)\n1 Annecy\n2 Chamb\u00e9ry\n3 Grenoble (Winter Olympic Games in 1968)\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n\nSki resorts\n1 Alpe d'Huez\n2 Brides les Bains (part of Les Trois Vall\u00e9es)\n3 Chamonix (Winter Olympic Games in 1924)\n4 Courchevel (part of Les Trois Vall\u00e9es; 2030 Winter Olympics)\n Isola 2000\n5 La Clusaz\n6 Le Grand Massif\n7 Les Arcs\n8 Les Deux Alpes\n Les Menuires (part of Les Trois Vall\u00e9es)\n9 Les Trois Vall\u00e9es (Winter Olympic Games 1992)\n10 Meribel (part of Les Trois Vall\u00e9es; 2030 Winter Olympics)\n11 Meg\u00e8ve\n12 Portes du Soleil\n13 Risoul (part of La For\u00eat Blanche)\n14 Tignes /Val d'Is\u00e8re\n15 Val Thorens (part of Les Trois Vall\u00e9es)\n Vars (part of La For\u00eat Blanche)\n\n\nWater sports\n Lake of Aiguebelette\n Lake of Annecy\n Lake of Bourget\n Lake Geneva - the Societe Nautique de Geneve and the mercenary team of Alinghi hold the America's Cup.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nTalk\nThe primary language in the French Alps is French, although as with any other tourism hotspot, don't be surprised if your broken French is met with well spoken English.\n\n\nGet in\nDue to the mountains, you can't fly directly into the French Alps, however, you can fly to surrounding airports and arrange transfer from there. There are many companies that specialise in airport transfers from local airports to all the major ski resorts. The major local airports are in Grenoble and Chamb\u00e9ry.\n\n\nGet around\nOne of the best ways to get around the Alps is renting a car. It gives you the freedom to go wherever you please while you're there and take in all the wonderful scenery. As a major tourist location, there are plenty of car rental agencies to help you do this.\n\n\nSee\nThe tallest mountain in the Alps and in Europe (outside the Caucasus) is Mont Blanc in Haute-Savoie, which stands at 4,807 m (15,767 ft), so it's definitely worth a look if travelling to the Alps. Lake Geneva is another natural landmark that can be seen in this area.\n\n\nDo\nThe beautiful terrain around the French Alps means that there is plenty to do all year round and that people can try a range of diverse and exciting activities. The area is of course most famous for its skiing  however visitors flock to the area for a variety of other activities including mountain biking, hiking and mountaineering.\n\n\nEat\nThe French Alps have also great many restaurants and are especially famous for its numerous varieties of cheese.\n\n\nDrink\nThe popularity of the Alps, particularly for skiing, has led to very high prices, especially for drinks.  It is not unusual to pay more than \u20ac4 for a small glass of beer in a mountain bar.\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next",
