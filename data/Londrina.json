  "extract": "Londrina is a large city in Northern Paran\u00e1, southern Brazil. It is a wealthy center of a coffee-producing region. It could be a stopover to or from Foz do Igua\u00e7u. The word Londrina means \"Little London\", a name which comes from the fact that a London-based cotton company, Paran\u00e1 Plantations Limited, made the original investment to settle in the area.\n\n\nGet in\nAirport with daily flights to Curitiba, S\u00e3o Paulo, Campinas, and others.\nGood long distance bus connections.\nBR-369 connects the city with Ourinhos, S\u00e3o Paulo to the east\nHerminio Ant\u00f4nio Pennacchi Highway connects to Maring\u00e1 to the west\n\n\nGet around\nCity buses can be a challenge. They are more frequent during office hours, specially close to the University hours, so it's very likely that they will be crowded with students. Any other time, you'll probably wait very long for your bus, as sometimes they can take longer than an hour to come. Transporte Coletivo Grande Londrina (TCGL)'s website (http://www.tcgrandelondrina.com.br/) has bus lines and time tables, though it's not easy to find your way around it, either.\nTaxis are frequent and to be found everywhere. However, Londrina's traffic sometimes won't help you, and you'll find red light after red light. Be prepared to pay R$ 15 to R$ 20 for short distances.\n\n\nSee\n\n Cal\u00e7ad\u00e3o (Huge Sidewalk), Av. Prof. Jo\u00e3o C\u00e2ndido. Connecting the core of downtown Londrina with a street that is a dedicated pedestrian walkway has proven to be a huge success here, and along the sidewalk you will find a number of shops (both large and small), various restaurants, a number of banks, and various other businesses of interest to those visiting the city. \n Lake Igapo Park. There are actually several lakes called \"Lake Igapo\". They are called, naturally, Igap\u00f3 1, 2, 3, and 4. There are several parks along the several lakes, but Lake Igap\u00f3 1 has the most well known. This park runs alongside the northeastern side of the lake, between Rua Herodoto and Avenida Amithas de Barros. Crossing to the north side of Avenida Amithas de Barros you come to what is called the \"zer\u00e3o\" (big zero), which is another park that has a number of sports facilities. \n Historical Museum of Londrina, Rua Benjamim Constant, 900 - Centro. The museum is a project of the State University of Londrina (Universidade Estadual de Londrina - UEL) and is located in the old train station - which no longer has any track going to it. The location is just north of downtown. The museum survives entirely on donations and the university, as there is no admissions charge. Free. \n Parque Estadual Mata dos Godoy, Rodovia M\u00e1rio Gon\u00e7alves - Fazenda Santa Helena, \u260f +55 43 3373-8700. Located far to the southwest of the city, and in fact located in the countryside quite far outisde the urban limits, Parque Estadual Mata dos Godoy preserves a small section of the original forest of the state of Paran\u00e3. Surrounding the state park is what you find has replaced the forest in most areas: corn and other monoculture farmland as far as the eye can see. \n\n\nDo\n\n\nBuy\n Catua\u00ed Shopping, Rodovia Celso Garcia Cid, s/n, km 377, \u260f +55 43 3315-5000.
