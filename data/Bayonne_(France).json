  "extract": "Bayonne is a town in Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques in the southwest corner of France, part of the Basque region straddling the border with Spain. It's part of the triple township of BAB, Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne, which in 2021 had a population of 309,392, and as a tourist destination it's been overshadowed by the more famous Biarritz. But it has more to offer the visitor, with its charming half-timbered buildings and range of interesting sights. It's also the transport hub for the area.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe town grew up at a point where the valley of the river Adour is pinched, and dominated by a hill. As the chief town of the Basque province of Labourd, it came under English rule from 1152 when Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry II; France only regained it in 1451. Whaling and later cod-fishing were important industries, forging the Basque connection with Newfoundland and maritime Canada. Around 1500, many Jews arrived here from Spain, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition - they brought with them the art of chocolate-making, and this too became a major industry. Around 1700, Vauban enclosed Bayonne within sturdy ramparts. The town was battered and besieged in 1814 as Wellington's forces advanced out of Spain against Napeolon's France. In the 19th and early 20th century, Biarritz was a fashionable seaside resort, but Bayonne was neglected. It revived after 1951 when a gas field was discovered, and the BAB area became industrialised.\nThe area around Bayonne has a high proportion of Basque (\"Euskara\") speakers, but in the BAB conurbation only 9% were fluent, according to a survey of 2006.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Biarritz Pays Basque Airport (BIQ IATA). This has 3 or 4 flights a day from Paris CDG (by Air France) and two from Paris Orly (by Transavia), both taking 80 min. There are flights most days from Nice, Lyon and London Gatwick; others are seasonal. The airport is 5 km southwest of Bayonne town centre. Txik Txak Bus 4 runs downtown every 20 min, taking 20 min, with the last at 22:30. (updated Mar 2024)\n\n\nBy train\nTrains run every two hours from Paris Montparnasse, taking 4 hours via Bordeaux and Dax. From Toulouse usually takes 4-5 hr with a change at Bordeaux, but one a day is direct, taking 3 hr 30 min via Tarbes, Lourdes, Pau and Orthez. \nFrom Hendaye on the Spanish border, take the hourly local train, which takes 40 min via St-Jean-de-Luz and Biarritz. The hourly Euskotren runs from San Sebasti\u00e1n (aka Donostia) to Hendaye. From Madrid trains run to Irun, where you walk across the border to Hendaye.\n2 Gare SNCF  the railway station is 1 km north of town centre, across the Adour river bridge.\n\n\nBy bus\nFlixbus runs four times a day from Paris Bercy Seine, taking 10-11 hours via Bordeaux. Four buses run from Toulouse, taking four hours via Tarbes and Pau. These buses continue across the border, either to Bilbao, taking 3 hr 30 min via Hendaye and San Sebasti\u00e1n, or to Madrid, 8-9 hours via San Sebasti\u00e1n, Vitoria-Gasteiz and Burgos. \n3 Quai de Lesseps is the draughty bus stop for Flixbus; no facilities here and little shelter. Bla-bla-car share rides also pick up and drop off here but you may be able to negotiate a spot downtown.\n\n\nBy road\nPrincipal autoroutes are A64 from  Pau, Tarbes and Toulouse, and A63 from to Bordeaux and continuing south to the border at Irun, where it becomes AP8 towards San Sebastian\nBayonne is on the historic pilgrimage route to Santiago de la Compostella. Routes through Aquitaine converge on Bayonne then there's a choice of paths over into Spain, with way-stations a convenient day's hike apart.\n\n\nGet around\nTxik Txak is the public transport network for the three BAB townships. N1, N2 and N6 are free navettes in town centre. On other routes, a single ticket in 2024 is \u20ac1.20, valid for 90 min including interchange between buses. Cheaper multi-journey tickets can be bought at the kiosk by Town Hall and at tobacconists but not on the bus. These include a 10-journey ticket (\u20ac9.60), a seven-day travel pass (\u20ac13.40), and a 24-hour pass (\u20ac3.50).\n\n\nSee\n\n\nSouth of River Adour\nThis is the charming Old Town, enclosed by grassy ramparts. Town and ramparts straddle a smaller river, the Nive, which here joins the Adour. West of the Nive is called Grand Bayonne and east is Petit Bayonne; the quays of the Nive are very picturesque. Several sights in Old Town close during the festival in July. \n\n1 Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-Marie, 15 Rue des Pr\u00e9bendes, \u260f +33 559 591782. Daily 08:00-20:30.

These can easily be reached on public transport. From San Sebasti\u00e1n, the \"Feve\" coastal railway runs west to Bilbao, Santander and eventually Ferrol.\nFor countryside pursuits, head north into Gascony and Landes, or up into the mountains. You'll need your own wheels.",
