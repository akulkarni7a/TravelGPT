Each 2nd and 4th Su of each month from 14:00-17:00. In a beautiful landscape dotted with traditional square farms connected by charming walking trails, famous painter Breughel drew inspiration from the countryside west of Brussels. Of the eye catches is the Luizen windmill, built on the Vlasendael plateau between 1862 and 1864 next to a farm in Butterfly St. (\"Vlinderstraat\"). It ceased operation in 1928 and was acquired by the Anderlecht municipality in 1939 with plans to renovate it. It was listed as a historical monument during the Second World War but for unclear reasons this protection was withdrawn in 1954. It remained abandoned, and the mill was quietly demolished in 1955. The memory of the mill was preserved, and in 1992 a group of citizens took the initiative to found the Luizenmolen association, with a goal to rebuild it. Gathering funding and construction took over 7 years, and in 1999 a historically accurate replica faithful to the original Luizen mill was inaugurated. Since 2007 it has been reclassified as a historical monument. Aside from guided tours being organized, the mill is also the background of a yearly folk festival. \u20ac3, children below 12 free.
