Metro station opened in 1976 and named after Belgian World War I air ace Edmond Thieffry. It has several interesting sculptures of modern art on display. \u20ac2.10.   (updated Nov 2022)\n2 Vandervelde, Emile Vanderveldelaan 107 (  1   direction Stokkel), \u260f +32 70 23 2000. 06:00-00:30. Opened on 7 May 1982, the Vandervelde metro station was named after Belgian politician Emile Vandervelde. The murals on the platform walls are from the hand of artist Paul De Gobert, officially titled La grande Taupe et le petit Peintre, but known as The Four Seasons because it depicts the transition of nature from one season into another. The 360\u00b0 painting is placed on top of a band in earth colors, representing the geological layers of the underground. The work shows the environment of the station as it used to look before urbanization, thus focusing the viewer's attention on the effect of urbanization on nature. Some of the marshes and willow trees in the murals can still be observed today in the Woluwe valley. The Four Seasons is the largest painting, in surface, in Belgium. \u20ac2.10. (updated Feb 2018)\n3 Stokkel (Stockel), Hinnisdaallaan 39 (  1   terminus station), \u260f +32 70 23 2000. 06:00-00:30. Stokkel opened on 31 August 1988 and is still the terminus station of metro line 1 to the east side of Brussels. Known as Stokkel for the neighbourhood it is in (or Stockel in the ancient Dutch spelling), the murals in the station illustrate over 140 characters from Herg\u00e9s comic The Adventures of Tintin (Kuifje in Dutch), one of the more populare and internationally known Belgian comic figures. The sketches were drawn by Herg\u00e9 himself, not long before his death, and completed by Studio Herg\u00e9 which conserves its heritage. Recommendable for comic and Tintin fans. The metro station is adjacent to a shopping mall, which by itself is also worth a look around. \u20ac2.10. (updated Feb 2018)\n\n\nArchitecture\n4 Solvay Residence (Hotel Solvay), Louizalaan 224 (Baljuw  54  81  93  94 ), \u260f +32 2 640 56 45, info@hotelsolvay.be. Not an actual hotel, but a large Art Nouveau town house designed by renowned Belgian architect Victor Horta. Horta was commissioned by Armand Solvay, son of the wealthy chemist and industrialist Ernest Solvay, to design his residence. Ernest Solvay had made his fortune from the development of the chemical process that bears his name, which offered a more economical method to produce soda (sodium carbonate), a cleaning agent and precursor to countless other chemicals. Having inherited much of the fortune of his father, Ernest Solvay gave Horta complete freedom for the design of his home, which translated into expensive construction materials such as marble, onyx, bronze, and tropic woods, and the inclusion of expensive details. Horta personall oversaw the design of every detail, from furniture, carpets, light fittings, tableware, to even the door bell. Many of Horta's favorite materials, iron, glass and natural stone, can be recognized in the buildings facade. Horta in turn commissioned Belgian painter Theo van Ryselberghe for the decoration of the staircase, commonly the centerpiece in all Hortas designs. The Solvay Residence was acquired in the 1950s by the Wittamer family, which gained its wealth from chocolate production and trade, and no expenses were saved to keep the house intact. Its exceptional architectural value and beauty made it onto the  UNESCO World Heritage Site list. To visit, you have to book in advance on the website.   (updated Jul 2018)\n5 Villa Empain, Franklin Rooseveltlaan 67 ( Solbosch  25  94 ), \u260f +32 2 627 52 30, info@boghossianfoundation.be. Tu-Su 11:00-18:00. Villa Empain was designed by Swiss architect Michel Polak as a private residence in Art Deco style, and built between 1930 and 1934 by industrialist Baron \u00c9douard Empain. Unlike similar Art Deco buildings of its time, Villa Empain was decorated with works of many different artists and as a result boasts a greater diversity than for example the Stocklet Palace. Empain donated the property to the Belgian state in 1937, with the intention of turning it into a museum of decorative and contemporary art. The foundation, known as the Le Cambre School hosted various exhibition in the villa until 1943 when the occupying German Wehrmacht requisitioned it during the Second World War. After the war it served as the Embassy of the Soviet Union until the 1970s, when it was occupied by a local TV station and abandoned in the 1990s. The neglected building was purchased in 2000 by St\u00e9phan Jourdain, a shady businessman who proceeded to strip the building from many of its unique artifacts, until the vandalism was discovered by the Brussels Monuments and Sites conversation society that responded by locking down the site in 2001. Once again the building remained abandoned and fell prey to vandalism and squatters until the property was acquired by the Boghossian Foundation in 2008 and extensively renovated. The responsibility for the renovation was given to French architect Francis Metzger who previously had successfully completed renovations of the Solvay Library and the Central Station. With a budget of \u20ac4 million, the aim of the renovation was to restore the villa to its 1934 outlook. From its inauguration as a museum and art exhibition center in 2010, the villa has hosted many concerts, conferences and cultural events, for which it was awarded the European Prize for Cultural Heritage in 2011. It is open to the public and can be visited, along with a museum souvenir shop and a caf\u00e9. Adults \u20ac10, seniors \u20ac8, students \u20ac4.   (updated May 2018)\n\n6 Cauchie House (Maison Cauchie), Frankenstraat 5 (Merode  2   5  ), \u260f +32 2 733 86 84, info@cauchie.be. First weekend of every month from 10:00-13:00, 14:00-17:30. Residence designed and built in 1905 by Art Nouveau architect, painter and designer Paul Cauchie, with a facade remarkable for its allegorical sgraffiti. Cauchie picked up this technique from Jean Portaels and Constant Montald when he studied at the Royal Academy for Fine Arts after obtaining his degree in architecture in Antwerp. Aside from his own house, only 3 other houses designed by Cauchie are known, 2 of them also in Brussels. Cauchie was more of a decorator than an actual architect, and specialized in designing sgraffiti for architecture. Cauchie designed his house with the intention of advertising and selling his own work, and the art of his wife. The house was easily seen from neighboring roads, and thus drew attention from passers-by and demonstrated the know-how and skills of the Cauchies. The center of the facade is marked with the words \"Par Nous \u2014 Pour Nous\" (By Us \u2014 For Us), illustrating this purpose. After completion, the Cauchies filled their new home with numerous works of art, paintings, wall coverings, furniture, and so on. It is therefore a good example of total art in architecture. The building was almost demolished in 1971, but saved at the last minute and classified as a monument in 1975. It was renovated between 1981 and 1988, and opened as a museum since 1995. The basement of the house contains the cellars where Paul Cauchies workshop has been converted into a gallery exhibition with photos, paintings and archive documents meticulously collected over the years to illustrate the artistic life of Paul and his wife. The upper floors have been converted into private flats and adapted to modern needs, and cannot be visited. \u20ac7 including guided tour.   (updated Jul 2018)\n\n\nMuseums\n7 Clockarium, Reyerslaan 163 (Diamant  7   12  21  25  28  29  79  N05 ), \u260f +32 475 55 2026, 2011@clockarium.org. Su 15:05-16:30. Museum dedicated to the history of 20th century art deco ceramic clocks, which were found in nearly every Belgian and north French household in the early 20th as ceramic was considered the \"plastic\" of the time.

The museum is also housed in an art deco building itself, designed by architect Gustave Bussuyt. The museum opens every Sunday at 14:55, and given the nature of the subject, visitors should assume that this time will be respected! Tours are only given in French. \u20ac6.

Local movie theater with a focus on Belgian, French and Hollywood movies. Can be reached by public transport by metro or tram.

While all the above locations are situated downtown in central Brussels, this location is the most popular bar on a strip of bars right by the Cim\u00e9ti\u00e8re d'Ixelles-Begraafplaats van Elsene. Its location right off the student campus make it extremely popular with students who just want to kick back and have a few relaxed drinks. Some nights there is also live music (making the establishment a lot more hectic). Worth a look especially towards the beginning and end of the academic year and in the summer (especially for their Jazzbreaks nights). \n\n\nSleep\n1 Tangla Hotel, Emmanuel Mounierlaan 5 (Hof ter Musschen  42  79 ), \u260f +32 2 345 67 89, info@tanglabrussels.com.
