  "extract": "Nantes (Breton: Naoned) is the capital of Pays de la Loire region in northwest France. Historically it was part of Brittany, whose dukes built up its castle and made the town their capital. It was also a major port on the Loire. Nowadays the economy of Nantes is driven by the service sector; in 2020 the population was 320,732.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\"Des principaux de cit\u00e9 rebel\u00e9e / Qui tiendront fort pour libert\u00e9 rauoir / Detrencher masses infelice mesl\u00e9e, / Cris vrlemens a Nante; piteux voir.\"\n\"From the principle ones of the city rebellion / Who will strive to cover their liberty / The males hacked to pieces, a futile conflict, / Cries, lamentation, at Nantes; piteous to see.\" - cheery prophesy of Nostradamus, Century V, Verse 33\nThe River Loire is navigable by shallow-draught boats for 140 km upstream. Nantes 50 km upstream is at the confluence with the small River Erdre, which has dumped its silt to form river islands and break the Loire into a leash of channels. The Namnetes were a Gaulish tribe; their name likely meant \"river\" or \"stream\". The Romans took control in the 1st century BC and stayed until the 5th century AD. In medieval times the town belonged to Brittany, whose dukes built up the castle and resisted the growing power of France, until a dynastic marriage of 1491 united the realms. In 1598 the town gave its name to the Edict of Nantes, which granted tolerance of Protestants or Huguenots; this ended religious wars in France but displeased many and horrified the pope. It was revoked in 1685, leading to a mass exodus of Huguenots and the blighting of French industry. \nNantes became a major port during the 15th century, and was the country's largest by 1700. It then grew rich from the Atlantic slave triangle, exporting manufactured goods to West Africa, thence slaves to the Caribbean, and back to Nantes laden with sugar, rum, tobacco, indigo, coffee and cocoa. The French Revolution was disastrous for the city's economy: Atlantic trade withered, wars with Britain brought a naval blockade, and other French ports outgrew Nantes. By the time the railway arrived in 1851, larger ships struggled to come this far upriver, and trade moved downstream to Saint-Nazaire. One observer of that maritime trade, and fired by tales of exotic journeys, was the writer Jules Verne, born here in 1828.\nIn the 20th century several river channels were filled in, and small river islands were consolidated into a single \u00cele de Nantes. No sooner done than France was invaded by Nazi Germany, which set about its trademark murderous regime. The city also came under heavy Allied bombing in 1943. Postwar saw the decline of manufacturing industry and the rise of the service sector, plus a large student population which helps the city feel young and lively. \nClimate is Atlantic - it rains. Summers are bright with occasional showers, sometimes thundery and heavy. Winters are mild.\nTourist information: Le Voyage \u00e0 Nantes is the helpful tourist office, at 9 Rue des \u00c9tats next to the castle entrance, open daily 10:00-18:00. The tourist office in Feydeau district has closed.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Nantes Atlantique Airport (NTE  IATA), Bouguenais, \u260f +33 892 568800. This has regular flights from Europe and UK (mostly by budget carriers) and North Africa, and seasonally from Montreal with Air Transat. For the time being, Air France fly 2 or 3 times a day from Paris CDG, but this is likely to fall foul of the law banning French domestic flights for journeys that can be done overland in less than 2\u00bd hours. Other domestic flights are from Lille, Lyon, Montpellier, Nice, Strasbourg and Toulouse. The airport has the usual facilities including cafes and car rental. It's a single terminal, with a ground-level concourse for both departures and arrivals.   (updated Jun 2023)\nThe airport is 8 km southwest of town centre: \n\nNavette A\u00e9roport shuttle bus runs daily 06:00-23:00 every 20-30 min, for a fare of \u20ac10.00. It runs from outside Arrivals to \"gare sud\" the railway station south entrance (20 min), Lieu Unique event gallery, and Place de Commerce (30 min; route shortened because of road works in 2023 to H\u00f4tel Dieu).\nTAN Bus 38 runs from the airport every 20 min, taking 25 min to Pirmil just south of the bridge from \u00cele de Nantes - change here for Tram 3 into town, while the bus continues south bank of the river to Greneraie. A single ticket costs \u20ac1.80 from the machine outside Arrivals (bank cards accepted) and is valid for interchanges for one hour. On Saturday and Sunday it's free.\nTAN Bus 98 runs every 30-60 min and stops at Lindbergh roundabout 500 m east of the airport, on its way from the village of Brains to Neustrie, terminus of Tram 3. You'd only take it for places west edge of town not served by Bus 38. Buy your ticket outside Arrivals as there's no machine at the roundabout stop.\nThere are no plans to extend the tram to the airport, nor to use the railway which runs right by it; instead a dedicated Busway will be built.\nTaxis authorised at Nantes Airport are Allo Taxis (+33 2 4069 2222) and Hep Taxis (+33 2 4085 4085). The taxi rank is outside Arrivals. A ride downtown takes 20 min and costs around \u20ac30. Have nothing to do with unauthorised taxis.\n\n\nBy train\nHourly trains from Paris Montparnasse take 2 hr 20 min via Le Mans and Angers, and continue to Saint-Nazaire. From Paris CDG airport you normally change at Les Halles / Montparnasse for a four hour journey, but occasional direct services from Lille or Strasbourg via CDG take three hours. \nFrom Bordeaux takes up to 5 hours, usually with a change at St-Pierre-des-corps. Two direct trains run daily from Lyon (4 hr 40 min), but most destinations in the south of France involve changing across Paris. \nFrom Rennes an hourly regional train takes 80 min; change at Rennes for Saint-Malo. Other direct local services are from Quimper via Vannes, from Orl\u00e9ans via Tours, and from Saint-Nazaire, \n2 Gare de Nantes was upgraded in 2020 so it's clean, modern and well-policed; expect some disruption as further work continues to 2025. It's aligned east-west: exit north (gare nord) for city centre and trams, exit south (gare sud) for regional buses and the Convention Centre. Both exits and the connecting bridge have ticket machines and cafes. There's also a connecting subway.\n\n\nBy road\nFrom Paris follow A11 west. From the Channel ports follow A28 to join A11 at Le Mans.\n\n\nBy bus\nBlablacar (owned by the rail company SNCF) runs three times a day from Paris (Bercy-Seine), taking six hours via Paris Orly Airport, Le Mans and Nantes (Route de Paris) to Nantes Airport. In 2023 an adult single is about \u20ac30. Flixbus have two late-night runs. \nBlablacar services from other French cities are often car-share rides, and may start or drop off some distance from city centres.\n3 Route de Paris is the miserable terminus for inter-city buses, just a draughty shelter outside Clinique Jules Verne in the northeast of town. Trams and town buses stop nearby.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nPublic transport\nTAN (Transports de l'Agglom\u00e9ration Nantaise) is the integrated public transport network, with three tram lines, two BusWays (buses with re-assignment surgery into trams), 50-some daytime bus lines, three night buses, and Navibus river ferries. Most stops have real-time indicator boards. \nIn 2023 an adult single ticket is \u20ac2 buying on board, \u20ac1.80 from a ticket machine, \u20ac1.60 from a carnet of ten, and \u20ac1.52 by e-ticket \"Formule Sur Mesure\". These tickets are valid for one hour with unlimited transfers. A 24-hour ticket is \u20ac6 for one person and \u20ac11 for up to four people. Town trams and buses are free on Saturday and Sunday: this includes Bus 38 to the airport but excludes the navette.\n\n\nBy taxi\nCity fares, last published in 2019, are \u20ac7.10 flagfall, \u20ac1.78/km travelled and \u20ac26/hr waiting. These apply M-Sa 07:00-19:00.\nThere are taxi ranks by Place du Commerce and the railway station.\n\n\nBy bike\nNantes is bicycle-friendly, with bike lanes along most major roads, and many small streets only accessible by pedestrians and cyclists.\nBicloo is the self-service network: registration starts at \u20ac2 for a day, with a \u20ac150 deposit. It's designed for short trips not extended sight-seeing, so the first 30 minutes are free, then you pay \u20ac0.50 for the next 30 min, \u20ac1 for the following 30 min, thereafter \u20ac2 per 30 min up to 24 hours. Other plans are aimed at long-term users. There are almost 100 pick-up and drop-off locations across the city, and the Bicloo map indicates real-time availability.\n\n\nSee\n\nJardin des Plantes is a bosky park just north of the railway station, bounded to the west by Rue Stanislas Baudry and east by Rue Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cailliaud. It's free to enter in daylight hours. By its northeast corner is the back entrance to Bouteillerie cemetery, with elaborate 19th-century ornaments, and First World War graves in regimented rows.\n1 Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne (Castle of the Dukes of Brittany), 4 Place Marc Elder, \u260f +33 2 5117 4948. Tu-Su 10:00-18:00. Sturdy moated castle built from 1207, though most of it is from 1466. It was a ducal and royal seat, notably of Duchess Anne, whose dynastic marriages sealed the union of Brittany with France in 1532. The Revolution did it little harm until a powder magazine explosion of 1800. It became a museum in 1924 but closed for reconstruction in 1990, re-opening in 2007. The main entrance is west by the tourist office and you can also approach north or south; these all bring you into the courtyard and the ticket office for the museum. Courtyard, ramparts and garden are free to enter. Museum adult \u20ac9, conc \u20ac5, child free.   (updated Jul 2023)\nMiroir d'eau is an ornamental pond south side of the castle with a pleasing reflection.\n2 Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre-et-Saint-Paul, 7 Impasse Saint-Laurent. Closed. Magnificent Gothic cathedral built in fits and starts from 1434. In modern times it has been seriously damaged by Allied bombing in 1945, by an accidental fire in 1972, and by arson in 2020. It therefore remains closed. The arsonist, an illegal Rwandan immigrant, was later given shelter in a church mission, in the spirit of \"turning the other cheek\". He then murdered the mission priest.   (updated Jun 2023)\nPlace Mar\u00e9chal-Foch is the broad pleasant square just north of the cathedral, named for the French military commander of the First World War. The fellow teetering atop the column with his head still on is Louis XVI, one of the few such statues to survive Revolutionary zeal.\n3 Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Museum), Rue Cl\u00e9menceau 10, \u260f +33 2 5117 4500. W, F-M 11:00-19:00, Th 11:00-21:00. A beautiful building of 1801 with an extensive permanent collection and temporary exhibitions. It has absorbed Chapelle de l'Oratoire, a baroque chapel of 1655 now used as an exhibition space. Adult \u20ac9, conc \u20ac4, child free.   (updated Jul 2023)\nChapelle Notre-Dame-de-l'Immacul\u00e9e-Conception is from 1470. It's in the block south of the Fine Arts Museum on Rue Malherbe.\n4 \u00cele de Versailles is an island in the River Erdre 1 km north of city centre, take Tram 2. The entire island is a Japanese garden and a pleasant place to relax.\n\nMus\u00e9e Thomas Dobr\u00e9e at 18 Rue Voltaire holds the vast personal art collection of Dobr\u00e9e (1810-1895). It's closed for reconstruction, probably until 2024.\n5 \u00c9glise Sainte-Croix was built from 1669 in classical style, with a richly decorated interior. The elaborate belfry-cum-clocktower was added in 1860.\n6 Tour Bretagne is a city landmark for all the wrong reasons. It's a 144-m skyscraper built on a postwar gap site and completed in 1976, when its slabby modernistic architecture had fallen out of fashion. Commercial and retail clients didn't want to use it so it's mostly stood vacant, and one of the few customers of the 32nd-floor restaurant turned out to be a base-jumper.\n7 Basilique Saint-Nicolas is a stonking granite neogothic basilica built 1844-69. The site meant it had to be aligned north-south, not \"oriented\" traditionally to the east. It was badly damaged by Allied bombing in 1943; reconstruction took until 1974.\nPlace Royale just south of the Basilica is a pedestrianised square with an elaborate fountain. It was built from 1786 when the old city walls were demolished and Nantes expanded. It too was bombed, but restored like-for-like after the war.\n8 \u00cele Feydeau has handsome 18th century architecture. It was an islet in a north arm of the Loire, stabilised and enlarged in the 1720s, becoming prime real estate for shipowners and merchants made wealthy by the slave trade. That river arm was infilled in the 1930s, but Feydeau district retained its unity of style and is still referred to as an \"island\". The central street is pedestrianised and lined with cafes.\nPlace du Bouffay just north of \u00cele Feydeau is an elegant pedestrianised square laid out in the 1770s, sweeping away a medieval neighbourhood and castle. Lots of outdoor cafes and bars here.\n9 Place du Commerce is city centre, with outdoor cafes and upscale shopping. Leading off it are Place Royale, Quai de la Fosse and Rue Cr\u00e9billon.\n10 Passage Pommeraye, built 1840-43, is an elegant shopping arcade festooned with neo-classical statuary. It connects Rue de la Fosse with Rue Santeuil, which is 9.4 m higher so shops are on three levels with a flight of stairs midway.\n11 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Graslin is centrepiece of the neoclassical Graslin district, laid out from 1780. Cours Cambronne just south is a strip of park lined by fine buildings.\n Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle, 12 Rue Voltaire (150 m west of Place Graslin), \u260f +33 2 4041 5500. W-M 10:00-18:00. Huge collection of minerals, fossils and stuffed animals, plus live snakes. Adult \u20ac5, student \u20ac2, child free. (updated Jun 2023)\nGalerie des Oubli\u00e9s has rotating exhibitions of 20th century artists who the owners reckon are unjustly ignored. It's at 2 Rue de Br\u00e9a, 50 m south of the Natural History Museum, open Tu-Th 14:00-19:00, F Sa 14:00-18:00.\n12 Place G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Mellinet is the focus of the west end of the city, with a circle of eight fine 19th century mansions. Mellinet was the commander from Nantes who from 1850 brought Algeria under French control. His statue is gesticulating with sword in the opposite direction, perhaps to feint a retreat or expedite an overdue lunch break.\n\n13 Notre-Dame de Bon-Port, more often known as \u00c9glise Saint-Louis, is a sturdy church built from 1852.\n14 Le Maill\u00e9-Br\u00e9z\u00e9 D627, Quai de la Fosse (Tram to Gare Maritime), \u260f +33 9 7918 3351. Daily Sep-Jun 14:00-15:00; Jul Aug 14:00-17:00. This T-47 destroyer was commissioned in 1957 and named for a 17th century admiral. Her only battle action was in 1962 as a troop carrier against the OAS uprising in Algiers. She retired in 1988 and is moored here as a museum. Visit by guided tour starting every 30 min and lasting 90 min. Adult \u20ac10, student \u20ac8, child \u20ac6.   (updated Jun 2023)\n15 Mus\u00e9e Jules Verne, 3 Rue de l'Hermitage, \u260f +33 2 4069 7252. W-F Su M 14:00-18:00, Sa 10:00-12:00, 14:00-18:00. The novelist Jules Verne was born in Nantes in 1828; shipping and the sea figured largely in his early life. He went to Paris to study law in 1847 and a thwarted love affair on a visit home soured him against Nantes. This museum of his life and works opened in 1978 and was renovated in 2005, the centenary of his death. He never lived here but it has his original furniture and personal items. Adult \u20ac4, conc \u20ac1.50, child free.  (updated Jun 2023)\n16 Jardin Extraordinaire is an exotic garden in a former quarry, with waterfalls cascading from its \"cliffs\". It's open free 09:00-18:00.\n\u00cele de Nantes mid-river is 5 km long by 1 km wide, consolidated from a string of islets in the 19th and 20th centuries, with 13 access bridges.\n17 Les Machines de l'\u00cele, Parc des Chantiers, Blvd L\u00e9on Bureau, \u260f +33 810 121225. Feb-Dec: Tu-F 10:00-18:00, Sa Su 10:00-19:00. Gallery of wacky mechanical animals. A guided tour continuously circulates, which you need to join as the guides stir each animal into life, and visitor movement is limited while these are in motion. (You especially don't want to be caught in the path of the monstrous spider.) The highlight is the Great Elephant, which stomps alongside the gallery spraying water at everyone. Those over 13 can ride it for an additional charge - book this in advance, as there are limited seats. Adult \u20ac9.50, child \u20ac7.50. (updated Jul 2023)\nCarrousel des Mondes Marins 200 m west of Les Machines is a similarly wacky three-level roundabout of underwater denizens.\n18 Grue Titan Jaune is a big yellow crane just west of the Carrousel.\n19 Grue Titan Grise at the west tip of \u00cele de Nantes is a similar crane, helpfully painted grey so you don't confuse it with the one that's jaune. The former banana warehouse here has been turned into an art and event space.\n20 Basilique Saint-Donatien-et-Saint-Rogatien is a neo-Romanesque church built 1872-89; the chapel and cemetery outside are much older. The basilica suffered a serious fire in 2015 but re-opened in 2021. It's named for two Christian martyrs of Nantes around 300 AD.\n\n\nDo\n\nLe Lieu Unique is a cultural centre at 2 Rue de la Biscuiterie, 200 m west of gare sud entrance.

Their home ground Stade de la Beaujoire (capacity 35,300) is 5 km northeast of the city centre, off the bypass N844. Take Tram 1.

They sail May-Oct several days a week, daily in August, taking 2 hr 30 min each way. The riverbank is dotted with wacky artworks. You can return on the train, which you'll have to do if you take an afternoon boat.\n\n\nLearn\nNantes Universit\u00e9 has over 37,000 students and 2000 academic staff.
