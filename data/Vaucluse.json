  "extract": "Vaucluse (Occitan: Vauclusa) is a department of the Provence region of France. The Vaucluse retains in part its historical identity as the Comtat Venaissin, an independent papal entity until the 1791 post-Revolutionary annexation by France.\n\n\nCities and towns\n\n1 Avignon \u2014 well known for its Palace of the Popes where several popes and antipopes lived from the early 14th to early 15th centuries\n2 Carpentras\n3 Cavaillon \u2014 a former episcopal seat within the Luberon Natural Regional Park, considered the capital of the melon.\n4 L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue\n5 Lourmarin \u2014 among the most beautiful villages in France\n6 Orange\n7 Vaison-la-Romaine\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Luberon\n2 Mont Ventoux\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe name of Comtat Venaissin is supposed to derive from either Comitatus Vendacensis (the county of Venasque), or from Comitatus Avennicinus (County of Avignon). The territory belonged to the Popes, but was de facto independent, governed by its own executive representative appointed by the Pope, as well as popular representatives. The area was very marked by the bloody history of the French invasion, as well as the civil war which followed, between the partisans of independence and the partisans of the attachment to France. In line with other departments across France, the Vaucluse was named after a significant local geographical feature, in this case the Fontaine de Vaucluse spring. The new name was intended both a definitive rupture with the past, and as a way to harmonise local administration into the nascent French Republic. However, despite generations of central government attempting to stamp out regional languages and cultures, a strong Occitan identity persists in the department. Linguistic aside: despite looking like a feminine noun, Vaucluse is actually masculine.\n\n\nTalk\nThe official language remains French, but a language commonly spoken by locals until the 19th century was Occitan in its Proven\u00e7al dialect. There are still some speakers of the dialect, and it is locally the daily language in some parts of the department, though like all regional languages in France, it is under threat.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nThe main access from the north is undoubtedly the A7 motorway (Autoroute du Soleil), which bypasses the famous national road N7, nicknamed la Route bleue and la Route des vacances during its mid-20th-century heyday. The A8 and A9 bring traffic in from the east and west respectively.\n\n\nBy train\nAvignon TGV station: on the Paris-Lyon-Marseille corridor, connects the Vaucluse to the outside world.\nAvignon-Centre and Orange stations both welcome regional and national TGVs and TERs, in addition to departmental traffic. A rail shuttle operates between Avignon Centre and Avignon TGV.\n\n\nBy plane\nSee also: Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur#By plane\n1 Avignon-Provence Airport (access by bus: TCRA Line 3 from Avignon-Centre). Only receives seasonal (i.e. summer) flights from Birmingham and Bournemouth.   (updated Aug 2018)\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\nAvignon is an open-air museum. Its Palace Square is inundated with tourists during the hot months. Not far in almost any direction are smaller squares, frequented by locals, where prices are found to be more affordable. Highly recommended is the Place Pie, with its halls where you can buy fresh produce, wine country, cheese, etc. Visits to the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne and the Jardin des Doms are essential. Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet is not far from the Palace, on the Rhone. Calvet Museum whose wealth and the importance of its collections have earned it to be admitted among the \"classified museums\". They relate to archeology, fine arts, decorative arts, especially goldsmith, faience, porcelain, tapestry, ironwork and ethnology in Asia, Oceania and Africa. Petit Palais Museum is a museum of painting, and the Requien museum is the natural history museum of the city of Avignon as well as many churches and colleges.\nThere are many myseums in other towns of the region: \n\nPetrarch Museum and Museum of Resistance, Fontaine-de-Vaucluse\nCampredon Art Centre, Isle sur la Sorgue\nMuseum of Arts and Wine Professions, Ansouis\nBakery Museum, Bonnieux\nMuseum of Basketry, Cadenet\nComtadin-Duplessis Museum and Sobirats Museum, Carpentras\nArchaeological Museum of the H\u00f4tel-Dieu and Jewish Museum Comtadin - The Synagogue, Cavaillon\nLavender Museum, Coustellet\nMarc Deydier Museum, Cucuron\nComtadin Costume Museum, Pernes-les-Fontaines\nMuseum of Cartonnage and Printing, Valr\u00e9as\n\n\nDo\n\nThere are many vineyards in this department, so wine tasting is an option for interested visitors.\nThe department has many hiking trails, whose signs are organised by the local council. Three free hiking tours are available at the tourist office in Fontaine de Vaucluse. A favourite canoeing and kayaking route runs from Fontaine de Vaucluse to Isle sur la Sorgue along the very beautiful River Sorgue, although there are also many other opportunities along the same river. The Mont Serein ski resort, facing north of Mont Ventoux, had several trails. Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are available, and there is a children's ski school on site.\n\n\nCycling\nCycle course at Mont Ventoux\nBike tours in Sorgues\nThe Calavon cycle path (voie verte du Calavon), between Cavaillon and Apt.
