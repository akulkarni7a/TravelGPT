  "extract": "Leuven (French: Louvain) is a flourishing and lively city of about 100,000 inhabitants (2018). It is the capital of the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant. It's a genuine university city which reflects in the streets. During the academic year (end of September until end of June) the city is full of young people, especially on weekdays. Sometimes it may seem that there are no other people living in the city. Summer in Leuven in general is calmer, although a lot of summer events are organised. The university that was founded in 1425 and has more than 40,000 students is the oldest Catholic university in the world. The historic centre is one of the most beautiful in Belgium.\nLeuven has a very central location in Flanders, which makes it the ideal starting point to discover the other parts of the nation: Brussels is practically just around the corner, the coast is only a 1\u00bd-hour train ride away and Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Li\u00e8ge, Mechelen and Hasselt are nearby.\nLeuven has everything to appeal to both young and not-so-young: buzzing nightlife, intriguing and sometimes stunning historic sites, the important and worldwide respected university and two seemingly unending shopping streets are sure to be to your liking.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe city has a long and interesting history, being founded probably in the 9th century. It was particularly interesting because of the location, at the river Dijle and close to Brussels. Most of the city was thrashed and burned to the ground by the German invasion in World War I, and was again damaged during World War II. The historic centre however has been preserved and historic buildings like the University Library have been restored, partly with foreign relief funds.\nLeuven is located just east of Brussels (20 km). It is the capital of the Province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. This means it houses a lot of administrative services and the Province Building, where the province council is located. Its main industries are technology (due to the University) and beer. Important companies such as InBev and Imec have their home bases in Leuven.\nLeuven has two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Groot Begijnhof (Grand Beguinage) is part of the Flemish Beguinages. The Belfry on St Peter's Church is a part of the Belfries of Belgium and France. The University buildings and the Historic Centre are also on Belgium's tentative list to become a World Heritage site in its own right.\n\nLeuven city government website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nBrussels Airport in Zaventem is the main international airport in Belgium and has many direct international connections from North America, Asia and especially Africa. Brussels has flights from all European capitals and most other major cities.\nTo get to Leuven from Zaventem, you may take a train to Leuven (13 minutes) for \u20ac11.20. It runs every half hour on weekdays and three times per hour on weekends. You may also take a De Lijn bus from the airport to Leuven (1 hr , \u20ac2,50). Taxis wait at the arrivals area (about 20 min, depending on traffic, about \u20ac70, \u20ac45 for pre-booked taxis).\nMore low-cost carriers arrive at Brussels South Charleroi Airport but travel time to Leuven is considerably longer (approx. 1\u00bd hr). You can purchase a combined bus+train ticket for \u20ac17.40 that will enable you to take the A2 bus from Charleroi airport to Fleurus, and from there on to Leuven or Heverlee train station. It is cheaper to buy the ticket for the TEC bus and the train separately, especially if you are younger than 26 years old. There is a direct train between Leuven and Charleroi; you do not have to change trains in Brussels. Pre-booked taxis cost approximately \u20ac90. More information on the airport's website.\n\n\nBy car\nLeuven can be conveniently reached by car. The E40 highway runs from Brussels via Leuven to Li\u00e8ge, whereas the E314 highway links Leuven with the province of Limburg and with Maastricht and Aachen, at about 1 hour distance. The city has installed a Parking Guidance System that guides you to the larger parkings in the city centre. Look for the electronic signs on the city ring road.\nDon't bother looking for a free parking spot on the street, since it's expensive and the many one-way streets can be a real maze when you're driving.\nThe speed limit around the city is 50 km/h, or 30 km/h inside the ring road and in certain other areas. Your chances of getting a ticket when crossing the speed limit, even slightly, are close to 100%, especially on the ring road.\n\n\nBy train\n1 Leuven Railway Station is one of the busiest of Belgium. There are frequent direct trains from:\n\nBrussels Airport (13 minutes)\nBrussels (Brussels North: 18 minutes; Brussels Central: 24 minutes; Brussels Zuid/Midi: 30 minutes)\nMechelen (20 minutes), Lier and Antwerp (50 minutes)\nGhent (1 hour) and Bruges (1 hour 20 minutes)\nThe Flemish Coast, with trains from Ostend, Knokke and Blankenberge (1 hour 30 minutes) and De Panne (2 hours and 30 minutes)\nAalst, Sint-Niklaas and Kortrijk to the west\nAarschot, Diest, Tienen, Sint-Truiden, Hasselt, Genk and Tongeren to the east\nLi\u00e8ge (30 minutes), Verviers (55 minutes) and Eupen (1 hour 15 minutes) in the eastern part of Wallonia\nMons (1 hour 30 minutes), Nivelles and Soignies in the western part of Wallonia\nOttignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, where there is a connection with the train from Namur and Luxembourg\nAlmost all cities can be reached by train through the Brussels North or Brussels Zuid/Midi hub. Eurostar trains depart from Brussels Zuid/Midi.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are bus lines from and to the cities around Leuven (Brussels, Tienen, Aarschot, Mechelen, Diest and Wavre). Buses are sometimes faster (and always cheaper) if you want to go to Herentals, Turnhout, Geel or other towns in the Kempen region. Almost all buses are operated by the Flemish public transport company De Lijn.\nThe 2 Bus station is located right next to the train station, but many bus lines also have stops on other locations in the city.\nFlixBus offers direct connections (once daily), westwards to Ghent, Bruges and Ostend and eastward to Maastricht, Cologne and all the way to Prague.\n\n\nBy taxi\nLicensed taxis have yellow-and-blue (or the older red-and-white) colors on top. They can be found mostly at the airport. One-way to Leuven usually takes 20 min (if traffic isn't dense) and costs about \u20ac70.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe city has installed several new touristic road signs and city maps at several locations, which make getting around in the city a lot easier.\nDon't be afraid to ask people on the street for information, as they are usually very open and helpful towards tourists - some will even walk you to your destination.\n\n\nPublic transportation\nThe public transport company De Lijn has a number of bus lines through Leuven. Centre of their network is the train station and the stop at the Rector de Somerplein. Since distances are not that big, you won't really need public transport unless you're going to Meerdaalwoud, Heverleebos, Campus Arenberg or the hospital Gasthuisberg. There is no subway or tram line.\n\n\nOn foot\nWhen arriving in Leuven by train, walk to the Martelarenplein in front of the Station and walk down the Bondgenotenlaan in order to get to the city centre: the Grote Markt (Grand Place) where the tourist information desk is situated. Discover the rest of the historic city centre from there. Note that you can also take the Diestsestraat, which is a pedestrian-only street.\n\n\nBy bike\nThe city has many special areas for cyclists and most 1-way roads can be accessed in both ways for cycles \u2013 beware of police controls on the one-way ones. It's very easy and comfortable. Make sure to lock your bike to a fixed object or the bike will be stolen. You can also rent bicycles. More information at the Tourist Information Desk (near City Hall).\n\n\nBy thumb\nMost streets and squares are car-free. If you want to thumb out of the city, pick a spot on the city ring road and hope for a quick pick-up. Most traffic is local or headed for Brussels. The Koning Boudewijnlaan is a good spot as well, since it leads to the off-ramp to the E40 (Brussels\u2013Li\u00e8ge) and the E314 (Limburg).\nHold up a sign with your final destination, as most people will not 'just' pick up hitchhikers.\n\n\nBy taxi\nLicensed taxis can be identified by the blue-and-yellow/red-and-white symbol and can be found near the Fochplein and the Martelarenplein. Although you probably won't need one, given the perfect railway connection, they're probably the easiest way to get to the airport, for example at night.\n\n\nSee\n\nYou can get more information about sights and more at the Tourist Information Desk on the Grote Markt, near the City Hall. While the most important old-looking buildings (Town Hall, Cathedral, etc.) are indeed from Medieval times, most of the common houses that look old are actually (non-faithful) reconstructions of buildings that were destroyed in the First World War; these buildings carry a stone-carved sign with the coat of arm of Leuven and the indication \"1914\".\n\n1 Town Hall (Stadhuis), Grote Markt 9.

It is for pedestrians only for the total length of the street (about 1 km!). This street also has two small shopping malls, one of them housing the Kinepolis movie theatres.\nLook for smaller shops around the Brusselsestraat, Mechelsestraat and the Parijsstraat.\nThe Bondgenotenlaan also features a lot of shops, but is also the main road between the railwaystation area and the centre.\nLeuven has a lot of clothing stores, jewellers, some fine bookshops and of course a few chocolatiers where you can buy genuine Belgian chocolate.\nSeasonal sales provide discounts up to 70% in January and July. Expect the city to be extremely busy, especially on week-ends.\n1 Tartufo, Louis Melsensstraat 14 (One block north of Bondgenotenlaan), \u260f +32 16 23 06 42. A small, independent chocolate shop that specializes in truffles in both conventional and unconventional flavours. Cash only. (updated Nov 2017)\n\n\nEat\n\nIn general, you'd have to really make an effort to find a horrible meal in Leuven. Almost all restaurants are tasty and relatively cheap (for Belgium), given the student population. Many Belgians enjoy French fries and snacks in a Frietkot if they're looking for a quick and cheap bite. Try fresh North Sea Mussels, during their season (roughly August\u2013March). Every year, you'll see the big signs announcing their arrival in front of many restaurants. Smoking is not allowed in restaurants.\nThe more common, bigger restaurants can be found right next to City Hall on the Grote Markt.\nLook for cheaper restaurants on the Oude Markt (Old Market) as that's where the student population mostly enjoys their meal. It has many smaller restaurants and bars (the Old Market is sometimes called the longest bar in Europe), but all of them stop serving food after 22:00.\nThere are many good eateries and a great atmosphere (eating outside during the summer is a can't-miss!) in the Muntstraat, very different styles from classical French Belgian cuisine to \"Mexican\", Italian, Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese. Consult the brand new website for more information. But these restaurants of this street are quite overpriced.\nParijsstraat has some restaurants with a nice atmosphere.\nThe Martelarenplein houses a lot of restaurants and bars just a stone's throw away from the railway station.\nThe cheapest choice are student cantines called Alma, which serve quite decent food for the whole meal less than \u20ac7-10 (two in the centre, one in the campus and many small ones). Students of KU Leuven get a discount, which makes each meal \u20ac5 cheaper.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Grill Pyramid, Naamsestraat 29. A nice and cheap pizza & kebab place. This place is students' mecca for its delicious and cheap pizzas! \n2 Soupaway, Tiensestraat 29. (updated Feb 2023)\n3 Past-a-Porter, Parijsstraat 8. (updated Feb 2023)\n4 Club \"Met\", Braban\u00e7onnestraat 117. (updated Feb 2023)\n5 Cappadocia, Brusselsestraat 156. (updated Feb 2023)\n6 De Spuye, Tervuursevest 101.

Good food and as you would expect excellent selection of beers. \u20ac20-30. (updated Feb 2023)\n9 De Klimop, Martelarenplein 5, \u260f +32 16 22 86 21.

(updated Feb 2023)\n12 Brasserie De Abdijmolen, Abdij van Park 4, \u260f +32 16 62 96 00. In an old abbey you will find a modern furnished restaurant serving excellent Belgian dishes. (updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nSplurge\n13 Taste, Naamsestraat 62. (updated Feb 2023)\n14 D'Artagnan, Naamsestraat 72. (updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nDrink\n\nIn Belgium, the legal drinking age in bars and caf\u00e9s is 16 for beers and 18 for spirits.\n\n\nFestivals\nAttend the nearby and world renowned Rock Werchter music festival in late June/early July, or Marktrock in the city centre, around August 15.\n\n\nBars and Clubs\n\nLeuven is truly a beer city, with the world's largest brewery Inbev being founded here. Try the many tasty beers, but beware, some have much higher alcohol levels than in the rest of the world! Bars are mostly entrance-free and prices are relatively low.\nYou can visit the many bars around the Old Market every night, but expect a lot more ambiance on Wednesday and Thursday during the Academic Year, when the student population is in the city (late September to early December and early February to the end of May).\nThe area around the Tiensestraat, where there are bars owned by student organisations:\n\n1 Huis der Rechten, Tiensestraat 53. for law students \n2 Politika, Tiensestraat 55. for social science students \n3 Recup, Tiensestraat 51. for psychology students \n4 Dulci, Naamsestraat 34. for economics students \n5 Fakbar Letteren, Blijde Inkomststraat 1. for linguistics and literature students. \n D\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. for the industrial engineers \nRegulations have become stricter in the last few years and visitors of these bars may be requested to provide proof that they are KU Leuven students.\nOther bars filled with young people are:\n\n6 Caf\u00e9 Belge, Oude Markt 35, \u260f +32 497 10 72 06. Has a wide variety of Trappists, abbey beers and special beers. In the day it is a normal cosy bar, during nighttime the bar is more filled with a younger and more progressive crowd. \n7 De Giraf, Oude Markt 38. If you are a fan of shots, this is one of the places to be. With over hundreds of kinds of shots going from classics like a B52 to dared combinations like a Chilly Willy (drink at your own risk!), this is a perfect place to get a little buzz going. De Giraf has been mistakenly associated with a left-wing crowd but when you enter you will immediately notice that this is a sad cause of prejudice. \n8 Lapaz, Tiensestraat 73. \n9   Alegria, Oude Markt 31, \u260f +32 16 20 11 07. Very popular with college kids and high school students alike. \n10 Domus, Tiensestraat 8, \u260f +32 16 20 14 49. small home brewery and tavern, the beer they brew is only sold there for consumption. \nMost parties take place in clubs in the city centre (and require a small entrance fee, \u20ac2-4):\n\n Club Montr\u00e9al (Naamsestraat, 100 m from City Hall). \n11  Lido, Bogaardenstraat 33 (Right next to the Ladeuzeplein), \u260f +32 16 23 23 83. \n12 Musicaf\u00e9, Muntstraat 5, \u260f +32 16 20 06 41. \n13 Albatros, Brusselsestraat 15 (100m from City Hall), \u260f +32 16 22 31 09. \nLarger venues are outside the city centre, and have a slightly higher entrance fee (\u20ac5\u20139) and drinks cost a bit more.\n\n Club Room (about 8km from the city centre in the suburb Herent). Open on Friday and Saturday, offering theme evenings such as a gay-friendly evening every first Friday of the month. Take a taxi or a nightbus. \n\n\nSleep\n\n\nBudget\n1 Youth Hostel Blauwput, Martelarenlaan 11. The Hostelling International youth hostel in Leuven.

Modern high quality hotel just outside the city centre, near the old market, within an old cloister. \n\n\nStay safe\nLeuven is a very safe and clean city, with very low crime records.\nIn general, there are no unsafe spots in the city best avoided. The streets are safe, even at night, although you better avoid public gardens at night. Even though most of them have closing hours which vary throughout the seasons.\nOf course, it is advised to take the precautions tourists are urged to take everywhere (e.g. to avoid pickpocketing). If you have a bike, make sure it is secured with a decent lock as students tend to 'borrow' bicycles. Similarly, jackets left unattended in bars may be at risk.\nThe city centre police station is located next to City Hall at Grote Markt. Don't hesitate to walk in if you have questions. Police usually patrol by car and on foot, and most of the times anonymously instead of walking around in uniform (especially at night). Try to avoid the area around Sint-Maartensdal and De Bruul (between Brouwersstraat and Pereboomstraat). There are also some spots in the suburb Kessel-Lo which are better avoided at night (Casablanca and Vredespleintje).\nPolice are especially harsh on traffic violations (also the ones made on a bike!), violent behavior and public disturbance.\nBelgium and the Netherlands have different drug regulations! Smoking pot (marijuana) is not permitted, although it is tolerated when done indoors. An adult can never have more than needed for 'personal use'. Expect any more to be confiscated if they are found by police and you risk being penalized.\nUseful phone numbers:\n\nPolice: 101\nEmergencies: 112 (can be used from mobile phones).\nLocal police: \u260f +32 16 21 06 11 (016 21 06 11 from landlines).\nLeuven is a student city, and therefore has had a history of minor vandalism (garbage being thrown around, throwing beer cans) and public drunkenness. Lately, this situation has improved when talks between locals, student organizations and police were installed. Stewards now keep things organized and make sure the party is kept inside instead of in the streets. It is therefore advisable to keep a low profile in the streets at night, as police and stewards will act.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\nLeuven has two larger hospitals:\n\nThe Academic Hospital UZ Leuven Gasthuisberg is the largest hospital in Belgium and is located just along the ring road.\nThe Regional Hospital Heilig Hart is in the city centre. As always, dial 112 when you are in distress. You will be taken to either of both hospitals.\nFor smaller health problems, Belgians usually go to their family doctor, who are often in a group practice in city areas. Ask your hotel, hostel or guide for information on the nearest doctor. Going to the Emergency Room for small health problems will not only cost you, it will also take longer to get help (ca 45 minutes).\nLeuven has a pharmacy at every corner. You can not buy medication in a supermarket.\n\n\nConnect\nAs of July 2022, Leuven has 4G from Base / Telenet and Orange, and 5G from Proximus / Scarlet.\n\n\nGo next\nLeuven is 30 min from Brussels, an hour from Ghent and 80 min from Bruges.",
