From Neuhaus, you can take a bus or boat back to Interlaken.\nHiking: There are plenty of great hikes in the Interlaken area. Popular nearby hikes include Harder mountain (mountain train 5 min. from Interlaken Ost station) and Schynige Platte (mountain train from Wilderswil).

Outdoor Interlaken is on the main street in Matten. Another great option is Alpin Raft Alpin is the original outdoor adventure company in Interlaken; the owner bought a raft in New Zealand in the late 1980s and was the first to bring white water rafting to Switzerland. He also brought canyoning to Interlaken after trying it in France. The canyoning experience with AlpinRaft is amazing.\nSwimming: You can swim in the lakes of Brienz and Thun. The water in the lake of Thun is generally warmer (around 20\u00b0C in July/August). A popular swimming area with showers, changing rooms, a restaurant, etc. is in Neuhaus. A real insider-tip is the beautiful \"Burgseeli\" in Ringgenberg-Goldswil.

The staff will go above and beyond to help you celebrate birthdays and other events. Groups up to 25, and a bar that can seat about 10 more.
