  "extract": "Poitiers is a city in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of western France.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nPoitiers is a pleasant, relatively small city of around 85,000 inhabitants that has strong medieval roots. It is on the Clain river.\nCharles Martel changed the course of French and European history near Poitiers in 732 by halting the advancing Moors in the Battle of Tours, which was the first decisive Christian victory over the Moorish invaders. The battle took place just a few kilometres north of the city.\nThere isn't a lot to see in Poitiers. To be honest and to make a long story short, it's a boring place.\n\n\nGet in\nPoitiers is roughly 350 km (220 mi) due south of Paris, 120 km (75 mi) East of the Atlantic Coast.\n\n\nBy car\nHalfway between Paris and Bordeaux on the motorway A10, Poitiers can be a nice place to stay for a couple of days on a trip to other destinations in the South West region of France.\n\n\nBy train\nThe journey from Paris (Montparnasse station) to Poitiers takes 90 min on the TGV high speed train. Upon arrival, the city centre is straight ahead out of the station, on the top of the hill.\n\n1 Poitiers railway station (Gare de Poitiers), 2 boulevard Pont Achard.   (updated Sep 2021)\n\n\nBy plane\n2  Poitiers\u2013Biard Airport (PIS  IATA). Offers daily international connections from London Stansted Airport with Ryanair, the flight takes a little over an hour, and Lyon, a major French hub.   \n\n\nBy bus\n Poitiers Bus Station (Gare Routi\u00e8re de Poitiers), 52 Bd du Grand Cerf, 86000 Poitiers. Open 24/7. Located right next to the train station, it links Poitiers to others cities through the Nouvelle-Aquitaine as well as Eurolines buses \n\n\nGet around\n\nGiven the small size of the city centre, walking is the best way to get around.  All the main attractions, apart from Futuroscope, are within reasonable walking distance of each other.\nPoitiers' train and bus stations are next to each other. Nearby towns, cities, and local attractions can be reached by bus, operated by Vitalis.\n\n\nSee\nAs stated above, there isn't a lot to see in Poitiers, but it is a pleasant small city, and visitors will find it has a relaxed atmosphere, especially compared to Paris. Poitiers is also a good base to visit nearby towns like La Rochelle or Tours.\n\n City Centre. Has a small square called \"La Place d'Armes\" in front of the Town Hall, which is surrounded by cafes, where you can sit down with a glass of wine or coffee or get something to eat. It is being refurbished; the whole area is now a pedestrian only zone. It gets packed on weekends, especially during summer. Other parts of the town may give you an impression of a ghost town, especially during lunchtime, when the shops are closed. (updated Feb 2018)\n Baptistry of St. John. One of the oldest Christian buildings in Europe, dating back to 4th century. Inside, you can see the baptismal pool on the floor.

(updated Feb 2018)\n2 Church of Notre Dame (\u00c9glise Notre-Dame la Grande, Poitiers). Virgin Mary is the Patron Saint of France, so every town will have a church named Notre Dame (Our Lady). Poitiers' Notre Dame dates from the medieval times and is of Romanesque architecture. On some evenings after dark, light shows are projected on its fa\u00e7ade to illustrate how colourful it used to be.   (updated Feb 2018)\n\n\nDo\n1 Futuroscope.

These can be found at Rannou Metivier, which has two shops in Poitiers' town centre (30, rue des cordeliers and 13bis, rue des cordeliers).\n\"Le Broy\u00e9 du Poitou\", the Crushed of the Poitou, a biscuit the size of a cookie that is called this way because it was traditionally shared by hitting it of a punch in its centre, hence breaking it.

The main producer is Goulibeur.\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\nAlthough the city is small, the significant student population in the city do make the city alive, even at night.
