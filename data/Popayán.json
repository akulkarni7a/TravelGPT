It is the capital of the Cauca department.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe city was founded in 1537 by Sebastian de Belalcazar. Because of its beautiful colonial houses, it is known as the \"white city\". Popayan has played a major role in Colombia's history dating back to the early days of the Spanish conquest and into the 20th century.  A number of Colombian presidents were born in Popayan including, most recently, Guillermo Leon Valencia from 1962 to 1966. Other well-known citizens include Francisco Jose de Caldas (1768-1816) and Camilo Torres (1766-1816).  Popay\u00e1n has one of Colombia's oldest universities: the Universidad del Cauca, founded in 1827.

The airport in the neighbouring city of Cali (100-minute car ride) serves many domestic and international destinations.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are numerous bus companies available.

The historical centre is fairly compact and best explored on foot. Taxis are plentiful and can bring you at the bus terminal for around COP$3,000.\n\n\nSee\nSince Popayan was a seat of power during Spanish colonial times, there are numerous architectural gems in the city.
