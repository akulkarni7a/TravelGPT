With restaurants from all Europe, Asia, the Americas, the Middle-East, and even Africa. Chapinero is also where the majority of foreign embassies and International NGO's are located. Famed neighborhood Quinta Camacho is also located in Chapinero. Built in the 1930s, as planned urbanization for wealthy Bogotanos, Quite Camacho combines both English and Parisian architecture.
