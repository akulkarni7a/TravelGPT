It can be reached by regular multi-stop ferries from the port city of Paranagu\u00e1, or on shorter direct ferries from nearby Pontal do Sul\n\n\nGet around\nThe island has no roads or cars, only a network of sandy trails. Trails spread out from the village center, known as Nova Brasilia, which is on the south side of the narrow isthmus connecting the two parts of the island.\n\n\nSee\n \n1 Conchas Lighthouse (Farol das Conchas) (about 15 minutes' walk southeast from Nova Bras\u00edlia). A good place to take pictures, and also to get a good idea of the shape of the island.  \n Gruta das Encantadas (about an hour and a half walk south from Nova Bras\u00edlia). This grotto is the subject of many a myth or legend. \n Portuguese Fort (Fortaleza Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres), on the northeast face of the island (about 45 minutes' walk north along the beach).

Clean rooms and a nice restaurant attached.\n\n\nGo next\nDespite its relative sleepiness, the island can become unbearably crowded on weekends and public holidays. There are many other islands in the region; to really get off the beaten track, hire a boat and skip over to Ilha das Pe\u00e7as the next island over, or Ilha do Superagui, two islands over. Ilha das Pe\u00e7as can also be reached on a regular municipal passenger ferry leaving from Paranagu\u00e1, which visits several other islands on its route and ends up in Guaraque\u00e7aba, on the mainland, also well worth a visit. Around Guaraque\u00e7aba there is a wealth of hiking opportunities in the pristine and immaculate rain forest. Contact Sr. Jo\u00e3o at the Pousada Chau\u00e1 for an excellent guide of the region. Ask him especially about the Sebu\u00ed trail, an excellent all-day boat trip and hike with marvelous waterfalls and swimming opportunities. The village on Superagui Island can only be reached by chartering a boat or by walking around the southern tip of Ilha das Pe\u00e7as from its village to the straight between the two islands and hailing a boat to come and pick you up from the other shore. The long and deserted beach on Superagui, north of the village, is one of the best surfing spots in the south of the country, and the whole region is excellent for kayaking. On Pe\u00e7as and Superagui there are simple pousadas to stay in.",
