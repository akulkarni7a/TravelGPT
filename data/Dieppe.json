  "extract": "Dieppe is a town in Normandy on the north coast of France, approximately opposite Brighton on the English coast.\nDieppe has a long and interesting history, having been an important port linking William the Conqueror's English kingdom with his Normandy duchy in the 11th century, and later an important port for smuggling. It endured centuries of conflict right up until 1944. Today, it's an important ferry and fishing port, and a pleasant seaside resort.\n\n\nUnderstand\nPerhaps because of its drippy-sounding name, Dieppe is unfairly characterised in the British media as a boring and rainy resort, popular only for its ease of access from Newhaven. Well, the town can't do anything about the weather, but there is little truth to the rest of the clich\u00e9. Dieppe is in fact the nearest beach resort to Paris, and is lively all year round. It has a fine beach, a good range of activities, several pretty harbours, lots of attractive brick architecture and numerous critically-acclaimed seafood restaurants.\nDieppe is also well-known for a raid on the area during World War II, on the 19th of August 1942, by a predominantly Canadian force. Casualties were heavy and some consider the attack a disaster for the Allies, but others argue that it provided  intelligence that was essential in planning the D-Day invasion. Later in the war, as the Allies drove east after D-Day, Canadian troops had the left flank and liberated Dieppe. You will rarely find a French flag flying in Dieppe without a Canadian flag alongside it.\n\n1 Office de Tourisme Dieppe-Maritime, Pont Jehan Ango / Quai du Car\u00e9nage, \u260f +33 2 32 14 40 60.
