  "extract": "Ciudad del Este is the most eastern and second largest city of Paraguay at the border with Brazil. Its main attraction for visitors is shopping. This place is one of the access points to a great natural wonder of the world, the Igua\u00e7u Falls, a few kilometers away in the neighboring cities of Foz do Igua\u00e7u and Puerto Iguazu. \n\n\nUnderstand\nIn the city center, a myriad of shopping malls, arcades and department stores offer imported goods of luxury brands at unbeatable prices, making thousands of tourist-buyers coming during the day while the shops are open only to return home in the afternoon with the shopping bags full of bought merchandize.\nAlso very close is a unique feature rarely seen around the world, a tri-nation viewpoint where the borders of Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina meet at the mouth of the Iguaz\u00fa river into the Paran\u00e1 river. Other interesting sights to see around Ciudad del Este are the Itaip\u00fa hydroelectric dam at Hernandarias, the second largest in the world, the Monday river waterfall, as well as some interesting museums and nature reserves of the Atlantic Forest of South America.\nCiudad del Este metro area has a population of 550,000 inhabitants (2019) which includes the districts of Presidente Franco, Hernandarias and Minga Guaz\u00fa. It is the capital of Alto Paran\u00e1 Department and is known as ciudad jard\u00edn (garden city) for its numerous parks and green areas.\n\n\nHistory\nCiudad del Este was founded in the mid-20th century, in 1957, with the name Ciudad Presidente Stroessner as a tribute to the dictator ruling Paraguay at the time, General Alfredo Stroessner. The city name was changed in 1989 after the fall of the Stroessner regime by the current Ciudad del Este (city of the east) as it's at the eastern border of Paraguay with Brazil.\nIn the beginnings there were only an airstrip, two main avenues and the foundation stone for the church. The city started to grow steadily, first with the opening in 1968 of an international bridge to Brazil over the Paran\u00e1 river, then since 1973 with the construction of the Itaip\u00fa hydroelectric dam, which meant that thousands of engineers and construction workers moved with their families to live over here. Large subdivisions and new neighbourhoods were built and the city became a mecca for anyone in Paraguay with entrepreneurship.\nBut the most significant key element in the transformation of Ciudad del Este to a major city has been the inter-border commercial trade with Brazil, a giant economy with a huge internal consumer market heavily tax burdened. Local businessmen, mostly from the Middle East and China, saw this as an opportunity and convinced Paraguayan authorities to import almost all goods tax-free, thereby creating a significant price difference between Paraguay and Brazil. This situation has made downtown Ciudad del Este the main shopping destination for thousands of Brazilians, who come lured by the chance to buy low-priced electronics, clothing, household appliances and many other items that can cost up to 80% cheaper than if they were bought in Brazil. Forbes magazine once mentioned Ciudad del Este as the third most important shopping destination in the world after Hong Kong and Miami.\n\n\nEconomy\nThe local economy depends to a large extent on the border trade between Paraguay and Brazil, although a large part of it is considered smuggling by the Brazilian government. This is due to the activity of sacoleiros (Brazilian tourist shoppers) who cross the border to buy products in Ciudad del Este that then are resold in S\u00e3o Paulo and all along southern Brazil. The issue is that according to Brazilian import regulations, the purchase of items by Brazilians travelling abroad must be \"for personal use only\" and up to a monthly limit of US$300 per person. However, the sacoleiros, from the Portuguese word sacola (bag), do this every day, creating a very lucrative business of buying low-priced products in Paraguay and then reselling them in Brazil (up to 50%-80% more expensive). This business flow produces hundreds of millions of dollars and has allowed large stores and shopping centers in Ciudad del Este to be built very close to the border so that tourists do not have to walk more than 500 m into Paraguayan territory to buy products and take them back to Brazil.\nAnother significant aspect of Ciudad del Este's economy is the agribusiness sector, with soya in particular. The soil in the Alto Paran\u00e1 region is one of the most fertile in the world, so it has fostered the establishment of large soya plantations throughout the Eastern region of Paraguay which has led to large economic development with the sale of agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and the construction of large grain storage silos; the region has developed as a center for hundreds of trucks used in the transport of soybeans to seaports on the Brazilian Atlantic coast.\n\n\nTalk\nCiudad del Este is a bilingual community. Spanish and Portuguese are spoken side by side. Also there is a large Arab and Asian community, which run most of the local shops, so Arabic and Chinese are normally heard when you walk along the shopping arcades throughout the downtown area. English is spoken only in hotels and travel agencies.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nImmigration\nCrossing the borders can be a bit tricky. Sometimes, buses do not stop at the border. In this case, you need to go there first and get the entry stamp before taking the bus out. If you get in, you just get off at the border and walk the rest. Otherwise, you can always walk back to the border and do the immigration work. Nowadays, many nationalities do not need a visa and just receive a 90 days free to stay stamp. This considerably lowers the hassle in case you miss it, because generally you are allowed in. Visas on the other hand can be denied, and if you get in without proper permission, this can be a huge problem. Either way, as long as you have a valid entry stamp, everything should be fine. Do not bother so much about the exit stamp, no one will search your passport for the other country's exit stamp. Also, not having the exit stamp you can jump between countries, especially Brazil and Paraguay as long as you are in the region.\nLocals can cross the border and stay for up to 24 hr on either side without reporting to immigration or even carrying a passport (an ID card is sufficient). This is however not the case for citizens from elsewhere.\nTo visit Ciudad del Este from Puerto Iguazu proceed as following:\n\nLeaving Argentina is straight forward. You will get stamped out of the country automatically.\nWhen entering Brazil, you need to report to immigration to get your passport stamped, Since locals don't have to, taxi drivers and buses will often by-pass immigration, leaving you without proof of legal entry. Even when you report to immigration, border guards may try to tell you that no stamp is necessary, mainly because entering all your detail into the computer takes quite a while and they don't want to be bothered. However the large signs next to the immigration hall are rather clear about what you need to do, and if you do get stopped without a stamp for any reason later on, you'll very likely have to pay a bribe.\nWhen leaving Brazil, you need to get stamped out, which won't be a problem if you were stamped in.\nWhen entering Paraguay, you will need to get stamped in by immigration. Beware: Paraguay immigration will not stamp your passport if you haven't legally left Brazil (i.e. been stamped out). While most locals just bypass immigration - and doing the same it is probably not all that difficult - if you do get caught, you'll face large fines/bribe requests. Paraguayan border guards are obviously aware that many tourists do not get stamped in and thus stop unsuspecting tourists trying to leave the country. The option then is to pay a large bribe or be arrested and deported straight back to your home country - which is obviously a major hassle - both financially (paying for a new flight) and due to the fact that your luggage will be left at the hotel in Argentina/Brazil.\nIt is also possible to take a bus from the Puerto Iguaz\u00fa bus terminal through Brazil (Foz do Igua\u00e7u), across the \"Friendship Bridge\" and into Ciudad del Este. The bus is specially marked \"Foz, Puerto Iguaz\u00fa, Ciudad del Este\" or simply \"Paraguay\" and leaves from Puerto Iguaz\u00fa bus terminal at platform 7 every hour and costs AR$5. The ride to the Friendship Bridge will take approximately 45 min and you will be required to disembark at the Argentine border crossing to obtain an exit stamp before re-embarking the bus for the rest of the journey. If you're required to have a visa to enter Brazil and don't have one, make sure that the bus will take you all the way across the Friendship Bridge and into Ciudad del Este before boarding the bus. If it does not then it will drop you off right before the bridge and you will have to walk through immigration (exiting Brazil) and run the risk of being stopped and questioned by the Brazilian Federal Police about how you got into Brazil without a visa. Explain to them that you only wanted to visit Ciudad del Este and were unaware that the bus would not take you all the way. Also add that you will be returning straight to Puerto Iguaz\u00fa (Argentina) at the end of the day.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe 1 Terminal de Omnibus (bus terminal) is 1,5 km south of the city centre near Avenida Bernardino Caballero and next to the 3 de Febrero football stadium.\n\nThere are frequent buses from Asunci\u00f3n (5 hr) and Encarnaci\u00f3n (4 hr) in the south.\nThere are international connections to S\u00e3o Paulo (with Pluma for example).\n\n\nFrom nearby Brazil and Argentina\n\nThe most common way to arrive is across the Puente de la Amistad (Friendship Bridge) which connects Ciudad del Este in Paraguay and Foz do Igua\u00e7u in Brazil. There are frequent bus connections, also to and from Puerto Iguaz\u00fa in Argentina. Taxis sometimes do the trans-border trip as well.\nA couple of km south of Ciudad del Este, where Rio Paran\u00e1 and Rio Igua\u00e7u join, is a ferry crossing to Puerto Iguaz\u00fa in Argentina without crossing Brazilian territory. The ferry runs hourly during daylight hours for AR$5. There's a bus to Ciudad del Este passing close-by. From the centre (Av. General Bernardino Caballero), take a bus labeled Tres Fronteras (destination, not the company name) and ask to be dropped at la balsa (the ferry). Both countries have immigration facilities on their respective side of the river, so the ferry can be used not only for day tours but also for official border crossings.\nThere are two direct buses from Florianopolis (Brazil) into Ciudad del Este, 14-15 hr. The same buses in the opposite direction go from Ciudad del Este at 15:30 and 17:00 for GS.270,000.\nThere is a daily direct bus from S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) into Ciudad del Este, 15 hr. The same bus in the opposite direction goes from Ciudad del Este at 13:30 for GS.300,000. Furthermore, there are two cheaper weekend connections from S\u00e3o Paulo into Ciudad del Este. They go from Ciudad del Este to S\u00e3o Paulo Fridays and Saturdays at 14:30 for just GS.250,000.\nThe latter two-days-a-week connections also serve Rio de Janeiro, GS.400,000 from Ciudad del Este.\nAlternatively, take one of the more frequent connections (at least 6 a day) into Foz do Igua\u00e7u and take the border bus (R$5.50) from there\u2014see there for more details. These connection include considerably cheaper daily bus connections using the so called \"freight buses\" into Foz do Igua\u00e7u\u2014they are just half price the regular buses, around R$130.\n\n\nBy plane\n2 Guaran\u00ed International Airport (AGT  IATA) (in the neighbouring city of Minga Guaz\u00fa, 32 km (20 mi) from Ciudad del Este and 40 km from Foz do Igua\u00e7u.). Has direct domestic connections to Asunci\u00f3n operated by Paranair and Sol del Paraguay and to Pedro Juan Caballero only by Sol del Paraguay.   \nTo get from the airport to the city center you can take a taxi for about GS.140,000 or the Minga Guaz\u00fa bus, which leaves from the airport toward Ciudad del Este once a day at 13:00. The bus fare is GS.3,000.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\nIf you arrive with your own car, make sure you find a parking lot. Usually the local touts will lead you to one. However, if you do not feel comfortable with the situation you still can research a parking lot in advance as some of them have websites on the Internet.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are many local city buses available, typically charging GS. 4,000-5,000. It is common and advisable to sit down without paying due to the number of people boarding and disembarking as well as the fast pace of traffic. The driver's assistant will come by eventually to collect your payment and make change.\nThe trip between the centre and Hernandarias for the Itaipu attractions is GS. 5,000 (as of March 2023).\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis are available, but are unmetered. Always agree on a price before getting inside. If possible, contact your hotel in advance to find out what the normal fares should be (GS.20000-30000 from the bus station to Hotel Austria or Hotel Munich for example). Taxi drivers commonly attempt to overcharge foreigners either by quoting an unreasonable fare up front, or claiming they had quoted a higher fare at the end of the trip. Paying with exact change or close to it will provide leverage in case the driver attempts to increase the fare at the end of the trip.\nAt the bus station, there is a sign that lists prices to typical destinations.\nFor the adventurous, motorcycles taxis are common and a fast way to move through the heavy traffic near the Puente de la Amistad (bridge). Drivers are generally easy to spot due to their reflective shirts and should provide you with a helmet.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Itaip\u00fa (the visitor centre is on the road to Hernandarias; any bus to Hernandarias can drop you 500 m from the entrance (GS.5,000); get off when the bus makes a left turn off the highway or when you see prominent signs indicating the turns for Itaipu and Hernandarias), \u260f +595 615998040, cturistico@itaipu.gov.py. In summer, the below listed times are probably more extensive.. The Itaip\u00fa dam operator also provides a number of tourist attractions and tours, including the Tati Yupi Biological Reserve, some of which require registration. And you will mostly always need some form of identification, so bring your passport. And for registrations require ahead of the tour, they will need names, ages and number of people.The most convenient option is the simple Panoramic tour of the dam. However, it is worth booking a scheduled tour ahead, for a more interesting and different experience. You can still always do the regular tour. Free.   (updated Jun 2018)\n Panoramic tour of the dam, \u260f +595 615998040, +595 615998094, cturistico@itaipu.gov.py.

A free, short and underwhelming 30-minute tour, often in Spanish only, that involves driving around the dam on a bus preceded by a fifteen-minute video on the history and importance of the dam. A short lookout over the spillway provides the only photo opportunity. Free. (updated Jun 2018)\n Special visit to the dam, \u260f +595 615998095, +595 615998097, +595 615998099, rpmd@itaipu.gov.py.

An in-depth technical tour, which allow visitors to see the inside of the dam, power generation facilities, and turbines. Enquiry required at least one week ahead. (updated Jun 2018)\n Monumental Light Show, \u260f +595 615998040, +595 615998094, cturistico@itaipu.gov.py. F Sa 18:30 (winter), 19:30 (summer). An audio-visual show illuminating the dam. Prior registration necessary until the Thursday before. (updated Jun 2018)\n2 Scale model of the dam (Modelo Reducido de la Represa de Itaip\u00fa) (about 2 km before the Itaip\u00fa visitor center, so you need to get off the bus earlier), \u260f +595 615998040, +595 615998094, cturistico@itaipu.gov.py. F-M 07:30-15:30, Sa Su Holidays 08:00-15:30. A model of 1:100 of the dam. (updated Jun 2018)\n3 Itaipu Museum Guarani Land (Museo Tierra Guaran\u00ed (Itaip\u00fa) / Museo de la Tierra Guaran\u00ed and Zool\u00f3gico Regional) (about 2 km before the Itaip\u00fa visitor center, so you need to get off the bus earlier), \u260f +595 615998040, +595 615998094, cturistico@itaipu.gov.py.

(updated Jun 2018)\n4 Salto del Monday (Cataratas del Monday), Presidente Franco (Bus Matiauda (red) from the city centre). With a height of 45 m, 2 drops and 120 m width, the most impressive and beautiful waterfall in Paraguay. There are actually two (private) operators that grant access to the waterfall\u2014compare prices! With the one further down the road  you have a great view from above walking directly past the drop-off, but the elevator to the bottom costs a steep extra. Maybe not worth it, as you're too close to the falls directly in the mist.On the other hand, the other operator (the one that comes first along the road from Ciudad del Este) has a platform at the bottom of the water, which can be reached by staircase (maybe a better overview from the bottom here). However, its top view is further apart from the waterfall and maybe not that spectacular.Take a collectivo to the corner of Avenida Guarani/Avenida Monday and then walk to the entrances along Calle Aguaray. GS.84,000 (plus GS.30,000 for the elevator to the bottom).   (updated Jan 2024)\n5 Three Borders Landmark (Argentina\u2013Brazil\u2013Paraguay triple point) (Bus V.A. Matiauda). Paraguayan mark is quite far from the city, accessible by buses from the centre (Av. General Bernardino Caballero), take a bus labelled Tres Fronteras (destination, not the company name) by the bus company VICENTE A. MATIAUDA (red buses) and ask for La Balsa (the ferry), ask to get out in front of the huge gate. Free. (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nDo\n\n1 Refugio Biol\u00f3gico Tati Yupi (Tati Yupi Biological Reserve), 3km north of Hernandarias on the Supercarratera to Saltos del Guair\u00e1 (There is no direct public transit to the reserve, and the facilities are approximately 10-15 km inside the gates. 1.) To access the reserve without renting a vehicle, take a bus to Hernandarias. (It must have a sign in the windows that says \"Sin Area\". Other buses to Hernandarias take different routes.) Get off the bus at a roundabout with Copetrol and Petrosur gas stations on the far corners and a Diske taxi stand on the near right corner. From here, a taxi to the visitors center inside the reserve should cost about GS.50,000. The guards may be reluctant to allow a taxi inside, but with your permits and some persuasion they will relent and allow the driver to leave you at the facilities 10 km inside. Make an appointment to be picked up or take down the taxi dispatch phone number for park staff to call when you're ready to leave. 2.) Otherwise, just get dropped along the highway and hike the distance through the beautiful park.), \u260f +595 615998040, +595 615998094, cturistico@itaipu.gov.py. M-F 07:30-15:30, Sa Su Holidays 08:00-15:30. One of several areas of Atlantic Forest not flooded by the Itaipu reservoir, now preserved by the Itaipu Binacional organization. Refugio Tati Yupi is the most accessible and has facilities for camping, picnicking, outdoor grills, horseback riding, and a small hospedaje with male and female dorms and a kitchen. The reserve has many small trails available for walking and wildlife includes birds, capuchin monkeys, armadillos, capibara and more.To obtain authorization for a visit (self-guided), submit passport information and passengers online or at the Itaipu Visitor Center. Permission must be requested at least 1 day in advance of arrival and you will need to collect the set of papers to present to the guards for admittance. If visiting the dam before going to the reserve, permits can be requested in person in the office to the left of the zoo entrance. By stopping by in advance of touring the dam, zoo, and Guaran\u00ed museum permits can likely be collected before returning to Ciudad del Este at the end of the day. Entrance, camping, hospedaje, and horse riding are free. A cantina sells souvenirs and a very limited assortment of snacks and beverages.   \n\n\nBuy\n\n1 Paraguay Border Market. (the border markets close very early at around 16:00 in local winter and 17:00 in local summer, right before sunset). Shopping is the main business of the visitors. The main shopping streets are San Blas and Camilo Recalde, where you can buy almost anything. Many people come for electronics. If you want to buy electronics such as cellphones or cameras, always ask to test the device to make sure that it works. Never give it back to the shopkeeper/assistant as that person might exchange the device with faulty versions or hand the box back filled with paper but not with what you just bought.When walking close to the Paraguay border or around shopping malls, ignore people holding printed images of electronic brands inviting you to buy from them. If they insist, politely say \"No, gracias\" and carry on. (updated Jun 2018)\n2 China Shopping. One of the larger shopping centers and very popular with people that come here for the shopping. (updated Jun 2018)\n\n\nMoney\nDo all your money exchange 3 along the western half of Avenida Adrian Jara and Avenida Monse\u00f1or Rodr\u00edguez in the main shopping area. Even getting Brazilian Real for US dollars or euros is considerably better than on the Brazilian side\u2014and the bus ticket to Ciudad del Este is just R$5.50 one-way. (Calculate the effective rate: Dolares Compra / Real Venta, if not even they are able to provide you with a direct rate). In June 2018, they were giving very competitive direct Brazilian Real for US dollars rates. But of course, they also do guaranis for dollars and reais. Shop around for the best deal, there are about a dozen places. Avoid dealing with any of the street changers! But be aware, do not exchange with the unreliable street vendors. Most exchange bureaus close by 15:00, and even the latest at 16:00.\n\n\nEat\nDue to the premium placed on street-front property, Ciudad del Este's eateries and dining establishments are commonly found inside multi-leveled shopping malls and are relatively scarce on the main street of San Blas.\nAs a consequence of considerable immigrant populations, Ciudad del Este has a diverse variety of ethnic food options that one can take advantage of. Arab food can be found off the main streets and in many shopping centers and typically serve good Shawarma/kebab to go. Chinese and Korean food restaurants can also be found. Your best bet is to ask a local to direct you to the nearest restaurant or eatery. Additionally, because of the large influx of Brazilian nationals that enter Ciudad del Este every day, the most popular restaurants are those which serve typical Brazilian fare and are easy to find.\nFor some of the better-looking Asian restaurants, try exploring the areas around the corner of Adrian Jara and Av. Boquer\u00f3n. Not far from the same area are some US style burger houses. Above the \"Area Iris\" supermarket (corner of Av. Pioneros del Este and Adrian Jara) is a good but relatively expensive Japanese restaurant. In the supermarket various foods and other supplies can be had. Outside the supermarket, cheap hotdogs are available (but ensure that the hotdogs are heated well and not merely warmed - and this heating advice is recommended for foods from all street vendors).\nMany street vendors grill delicious and cheap asado at night on Cap. Miranda just north of the main route through town. A plate of asado with manioc is GS.10,000, and salad, bread, and a liter of beer can be had for an additional GS.10,000.\nVegetarians will have to ask around, but outside the city center there are a few vegetarian Chinese restaurants. Friends have reported that an Indian vegetarian restaurant called Gourangas is located behind the Municipalidad, not far from the city centre.\nLike most businesses in Ciudad del Este, you can pay for food with Argentine, US, Paraguayan, or Brazilian currency and expect to receive change in the same currency used for payment.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Govinda Restaurante Veg, Abay.

It has many dark alleys, overly many male tradesman, going forth and back around the border, and it is close to the Brazilian border. However, if you are aware and mind dark places at night, you should be safe.\n\n\nConnect\nFree WiFi is available in the park in front and from the 1 Biblioteca Municipal itself.\n\n\nGo next\nIgua\u00e7u Falls \u2013 One of the world's most famous waterfalls on the border between Brazil and Argentina, a little over 30 km to the southeast.\n\n\nTo Brazil\nFoz do Igua\u00e7u \u2013 A city just across the border in Brazil.\nTo leave Ciudad del Este back across the Friendship bridge, one has three options:\n1) Walk back across the bridge and wait in line at Brazilian immigration along with scores of people returning from shopping.\n2) Take a bus from the bus terminal that goes into Brazil or directly to Puerto Iguaz\u00fa and wait in the long line of cars.\n3) Hire a motorcycle to take you across the bridge through the line specifically for motorcycles that is rarely ever stopped by immigration officials. This can be rather dangerous as the driver will weave in and out of incoming traffic. This option is by far the quickest and took the Author 3 minutes to get from one end of the Friendship Bridge on the Paraguayan side, to the other end of the bridge on the Brazilian side - past immigration. Cost: AR$10.\n\n\nTo Argentina\nPuerto Iguaz\u00fa \u2013 A city in Argentina, less than 10 km south from Foz do Igua\u00e7u.\nThere is a ferry (balsa) to Argentina from Presidente Franco, just outside Ciudad del Este. You can get there from Ciudad del Este by bus for GS.2,500 (as of October 2016): take the red Matiauda which says \"3 Fronteras\" and ask the driver to let you know when get out. It's about half an hour in bus, and then you have a 500 m walk downhill. The ferry costs GS.10,000 per person if you're on foot.\nThere may also be buses that go directly to Argentina without doing immigration paperwork in Brazil.",
