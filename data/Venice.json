  "extract": "Venice (Italian: Venezia; Venetian: Venexia) is a sanctuary on a lagoon that is virtually the same as it was 600 years ago, which adds to the fascinating character. Venice has decayed since its heyday and suffers from overtourism, but the romantic charm remains. It is also known as the birthplace of composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi, and of the poets and opera librettists Apostolo Zeno and Carlo Goldoni. Venice and its lagoon are a UNESCO World Heritage site. It used to be an independent republic, and remains one of Italy's most important cities, with a quarter million inhabitants. Venice is also known as the home of the world's first international film festival, founded in 1932.\n\n\nDistricts\n\nMany visitors also pay a visit to Mestre (mainland Venice) and some of the neighboring islands in Metropolitan Venice during their stay.\n\nBurano \u2014 Popular with artists and known for its many small, brightly painted houses.\nMurano \u2014 Filled with quaint shops and restaurants, Murano is known far and wide for its high quality glass making.\nLido \u2014 Venice's long skinny beach, Lido offers a respite from more touristy and expensive areas.\nTorcello \u2014 Sparsely populated and accessible by vaporetto, this island offers a unique window into Venetian life.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nOrientation\nMetropolitan Venice has nearly a million inhabitants, and includes coastal and inland towns such as Bibione, Chioggia and Eraclea.\nThe comune (municipality) of Venice lies at the coast of northern Italy. It is made up of many islands in the Venetian Lagoon and a stretch of terraferma (mainland). The comune is divided into six boroughs, the most famous of which (known as Venezia Insulare) comprises the historic city of Venice as well as the islands of Giudecca, Murano, Burano, Torcello, Mazzorbo and Sant'Erasmo. Lido and Mestre are other popular areas of the comune.\nThe historic city is divided into six sestieri (districts): Cannaregio, Castello, Dorsoduro, San Polo, Santa Croce and finally San Marco, where the main monuments and sights are. Each sestiere uses separate house numbers, however they are not allocated in a specific pattern.\n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Medieval and Renaissance Italy\nThe Most Serene Republic of Venice dates back to 827, when a Byzantine Duke moved its seat to what is now known as the Rialto, and for the following 970 years, it prospered on trade (especially from the Silk Road) and under the rule of a Roman-style Senate headed by the Doge. Eventually, the Republic of Venice grew into a powerful city-state, and the cradle of Italian renaissance. In the late 15th century, the Ottoman Empire's expansion around the Mediterranean, new routes on the high seas shifted commerce to the Atlantic, demoting Venice's political status.\nThe city remains a centre for the arts. One of the significant events in the history of Venice was the opening of the first public opera house in 1637, which allowed members of the general public (those who could afford to pay for the tickets) to enjoy what was once court entertainment reserved for the aristocracy, thus allowing the genre of opera to flourish. Venice was an important destination of the Grand Tour from the 17th century. In 1797, the city was conquered by Napoleon, a blow from which it never recovered. The city was soon absorbed into Austria-Hungary, then ping-ponged back and forth between Austria and a nascent Italy, but Venice is still a monument to the glory days of the Renaissance, and historical culture still throbs powerfully in the old Italians' veins.\n\n\nClimate\n\nVenice has a humid-subtropical climate with hot summers and cool winters. For those who don't enjoy the heat, July and August may be the worst time to visit: it's sometimes very hot and often humid, there are mosquitoes and occasional infestations of flies, and there are a lot of tourists and large crowds. Mid to late spring and early to mid autumn are probably best, a compromise between temperature (expect 10-25\u00b0C) and the tourist load. Between November and January, you may manage to feel you have Venice all to yourself, an interesting experience. Beware of the weather during the winter months: it can be quite chilly, windy, and damp. Fog is an additional hazard if you are driving in or out, doubly so in the unlikely chance that you will pilot a boat. But if you've never been to Venice, it's better to go in summer than not to go. You won't regret it. Many cities are far worse in summer. Although Venice has no cars, diesel motors used by boats contribute to less than stellar air quality.\nAcqua alta (high water) has become a fact of life in Venice. The lagoon water level occasionally rises above the level of the squares and streets, flooding them. This can happen several times a year, at irregular intervals, usually in the colder months. Acqua alta usually lasts a few hours and coincides with high tide. You'll see raised walkways in side alleys ready to be pulled out when acqua alta hits. When the city begins to flood, sirens will sound to warn residents and businesses. If you speak fluent Italian, tune into news programs since their predictions of the times the flood begins and ends are usually accurate. Normally, the tide rises and falls in six-hour cycles.\nYou can get an acqua alta map at the tourist offices either at the railway station or St Mark's Square. This will show you the higher, dry routes and the ones with walkways set up during the various flood alerts. There is a tide measuring station at the Rialto vaporetto piers, and a noticeboard at the base of the Campanile in the Piazza San Marco that shows a live tide reading and predictions for the next few days.\n\n\nTourist information\nVenice tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\nWater plays a crucial role in transportation, as Venice is on a lagoon. Whichever way you arrive, the last part of your journey will be on foot from the nearest waterbus/watertaxi jetty. Bear this in mind when choosing your hotel location and route to it, especially if you need to carry bags along the narrow streets. (The sound of hard suitcase wheels on cobblestones is annoying, and they can damage marble steps.)  A lot of the higher priced hotels will offer complementary water boat transfers from the airport. \n\n\nBy plane\nMarco Polo Airport and Treviso Airport serve the city. If no flight suits you, check flying to nearby Bologna or Verona. From both cities trains and buses depart to Venice.\n\n\nMarco Polo Airport\n1 Marco Polo Airport (VCE IATA) (on the mainland near Mestre (a more typical Italian city, without Venice's unique structure)). This is the closest commercial airport.

Tickets can be bought at the airport from the automatic ATVO ticket machine in the arrivals baggage hall, at the ATVO ticket counter in the arrival hall (open from 08:00 to 23:45, \u260f +39 042 1594672) and from the automatic ATVO ticket machine outside the airport on the ATVO departure platform. In Venice, tickets can be bought at the ATVO ticket office in Piazzale Roma, near the Carabinieri station (\u260f +39 421 594 671), at automatic ATVO ticket machine outside the ticket office, at 'Chiosco di Pluff' newsagent in the center of the square 5 m from the departure point for the buses to San Marco Airport, at Botazzo Tobacconist's in Piazzale Roma, at the Novo Tour Agency in Piazzale Roma and at IEX Change Agency in St. Mark's Square under the Torre dei Mori. In Mestre, tickets can be bought at ATVO ticket office in Via Capuccina 183, near the railway station (\u260f +39 421 594 673), at automatic ticket machine outside the ticket office, at Bar Binario, situated near the ticket office, at ATAV - Associazione Turistica Albergatori Venezia, inside the railway station or at 365 Grandi Biglietterie Agency inside the railway station.\nACTV operates urban aerobus 5 service from Piazzale Roma to Marco Polo Airport on weekdays between 04:35 and 00:40 and during weekends between 05:40 and 00:40 and from Marco Polo Airport to Piazzale Roma on weekdays between 04:08 and 01:10 and during weekends between 04:08 and 01:10. The trip in a city bus takes about 23 minutes. ACTV ticket price for a 75-minute trip with water buses (vaporetti) and land buses starting and/or ending at Marco Polo Airport is \u20ac10 one-way and \u20ac18 return. One piece of hand luggage is included in the price. If you are willing to walk 1 km to save some euros, walk to the Triestina Tessera stop and catch the same bus 5 (or some other routes) for \u20ac1.50. Tickets must be purchased with the AVM Venezia app (confusingly labeled inside: \"Transport\" - \"Ticket Office\" - \"Automotive\") and activated before boarding the bus. If you have a Venezia Unica card (see local transport), you can ride to/from the airport for \u20ac1.50 (see [1] - \"The ticket includes travel by bus to or from Marco Polo airport only if loaded onto the Venezia Unica card\").\nAlilaguna operates three water bus lines from the airport. Such a direct water bus from the airport may be more convenient than taking the bus to the bus station and then changing to the local water bus. To reach the boat jetty, turn left on leaving the terminal and walk 10 minutes along the covered walkway.\n\nBlue line (linea blu) runs from the airport to the Cruise Terminal (Terminal Crociere) via Murano, Fondamente Nove, Ospedale, Bacini, Lido, Arsenale, San Zaccaria, San Marco, Zitelle, Zattere, and Giudecca Stucky. Boats leave from the airport every hour from 06:10 to 08:10 and from 20:15 to 00:15 and every 30 minutes between 08:45 and 20:15, boats leave from the Cruise Terminal every 30 minutes from 07:50 to 17:20. The boat trip from the airport to the city center (San Marco) takes about 90 min. This trip is very long and boring, so bring something to do. The trip from the airport to Murano takes 30 min.\nOrange line (linea arancio) connects the airport with Giglio via Madonna dell'Orto, Guglie, San Stae, Rialto, San Angelo and Ca' Rezzonico. Boats leave from the airport every 30 mins from 08:00 to 19:00. Boats leaving later in the evening go to Fondamenta Nove or San Marco only. Boats leave from Giglio from every 30 minutes from 6:48 to 19:48, later boats leave from San Marco only.\nRed line (Linea Rossa) goes from the airport to Giudecca Zitelle via Murano Museo, Certosa, Lido, and San Marco. This is a seasonal service and only operates between April and November. Boats leave the airport every hour from 10:30 to 18:30 and San Marco every hour from 9:05 to 19:05.\nThe ticket price from the airport to Lido, Venice, or Cruise Terminal is \u20ac15 one way (\u20ac8 IMOB smart card) and \u20ac27 return. Airport to Murano costs \u20ac8 one way (\u20ac4 IMOB) and \u20ac15 return. There are also tourist tickets which are valid for 24 hours (\u20ac30), and for 72 hours (\u20ac65). All tickets can be purchased online. The water bus services from the airport are operated by a different company (Alilaguna) than the other public water bus services in Venice, so separate tickets will be required.\nFrom the same jetty, you can travel in style (and much faster) by hiring one of the speedy water-taxis (30 min) for about \u20ac110.\n\n\nTreviso Airport\nThe Treviso Airport (TSF IATA), located 25 km (16 mi) from Venice near Treviso, is relatively smaller but becoming increasingly busy as the main destination for Ryanair, Wizzair, and Transavia budget flights. There are flights to Treviso Airport from Bucharest, Charleroi, Chisinau, Cluj, Dublin, East Midlands, Eindhoven, Iasi, Malta, Paris Beauvais, Prague, Stockholm, Timisoara and Valencia. There are domestic flights from Alghero, Bari, Brindisi, Cagliari, Catania, Lamezia Terme and Palermo. Flights to and from Treviso Airport are operated by Ryanair +39 895 8958989, Wizz Air +39 895 895 3322.\nThe airport runs over-capacity with seating and facilities, and the security line can sometimes be very long during peak travel times. If you arrive at the airport and the line is moving too slowly, you can purchase local fast track service at UFirst.com for \u20ac10. This is official but poorly advertised at the airport. There is no express passport control if departing the Schengen area.\nATVO operates buses from Venice to Treviso Airport daily at 05:30, 07:10, 10:30, and 18:30 and from Treviso Airport to Venice daily at 07:45, 08:15, 13:10 and 21:20 plus others not connecting to the flights to and from Treviso Airport. Flights arriving earlier or later than scheduled may affect the departure from the airport. If flights are cancelled the bus service will be suspended. The bus has two stops in Mestre, one in Corso del Popolo in front of BNP Bank in the historic center and the other one near the railway station and the journey takes about 55 min. The bus stop in Venice is at Piazzale Roma and the journey takes about 70 min. Ticket prices are \u20ac12 one-way and \u20ac22 return (valid 7 days) and have to be validated before boarding the bus. Tickets can be bought at Treviso Airport at the automatic ATVO ticket machine in the arrivals baggage hall or at the ATVO ticket office in the arrivals hall, operating from 07:30 to 22:30 (\u260f +39 422 315 381). In Venice, tickets can be bought at the ATVO ticket office in Piazzale Roma, near the Carabinieri station (\u260f +39 421 594 671), at automatic ATVO ticket machine outside the ticket office, at 'Chiosco di Pluff' newsagent in the center of the square 5 m from the departure point for the buses to Treviso Airport, at Botazzo Tobacconist's in Piazzale Roma, at the Novo Tour Agency in Piazzale Roma and at IEX Change Agency in St.Mark's Square under the Torre dei Mori. In Mestre tickets can be bought at ATVO ticket office in Via Capuccina 183, near the railway station (\u260f +39 421 594 673), at automatic ticket machine outside the ticket office, at Bar Binario, situated near the ticket office, at ATAV - Associazione Turistica Albergatori Venezia, inside the railway station or at 365 Grandi Biglietterie Agency inside the railway station. There is free Wi-Fi on the buses.\nBarzi Bus Service offers a bus service via the motorway from the airport to Mestre train station (about 30 min trip) and Venice Tronchetto (about 40 min trip). Ticket prices are \u20ac12 one way and \u20ac22 return (valid 10 days). Tickets can be bought at their desk in the arrival hall (\u260f +39 348 836 71 85), or on the bus. Tickets bought on Ryanair flights are not valid for this service. Barzi Bus brings you to Tronchetto, from there you can take vaporetto line 2 to the city center.\nIf you'd rather avoid the highway traffic and don't have bulky luggage, take the local Mobilita di Marca bus no. 6 for \u20ac1.30 (\u20ac2.50 if bought on board). It will deposit you at the Treviso train station in about 10 minutes. There are 2-3 departures hourly from the airport between 06:00 to 22:00. Then it's about 30 minutes on Regionale or Regionale Veloce train to Venezia Santa Lucia (also 2-3 departures per hour). The ticket price is \u20ac3.40 for the train.\n\n\nSan Nicolo Airport\nThe San Nicolo Airport (ICAO: LIPV, no IATA code) is an airfield directly on the Lido. It handles only small aircraft, as the runway (grass) is about 1 km long, and does not have any scheduled flights, but might be of interest to private pilots (arrivals from Schengen Agreement states only) due to its convenience to the city (it is a short walk to the vaporetto landing).\n\n\nBy train\n\nVenice is well-connected with the domestic train network, Rome and Milan are only a few hours away. Also there are some night trains from cities in southern Italy, though since 2012 most services have been canceled. Freccia Bianca (White Arrow) trains to Trieste leave from Venezia Mestre at 10:24, 19:45 and 21:59 and the trip takes about 1 hr 35 min. Regionale Veloce (Fast Regional) trains leave from Santa Lucia station at 09:11, 09:48, 12:09, 13:09, every hour from 14:11 to 18:11, at 19:35, the trip taking about 2 hr 5 min.

There are Freccia Argento (Silver Arrow) trains to Rome leaving Santa Lucia at 10:25, 13:25, 15:25 and 18:25, via Bologna and Florence arriving in Rome 3 hr 50 min later, and an Intercity Night train leaving Santa Lucia at 00:07, arriving in Rome at 06:35 next morning. Iitalo offers train services from Santa Lucia to Rome at 07:55, 09:55, 12:55 and 18:55, arriving Romea Ostiense at 11:50, 13:50, 16:50 and 22:50, and at 15:55 arriving at Roma Tiburtina at 19:30.\nDirect trains to Venice are available from many international destinations, there are sleeper trains from Munich and Vienna operated by \u00d6BB as part of their Nightjet brand.\n\nNightjet trains to Munich depart Santa Lucia at 21:04 and arrive in Munich at 06:10. The train from Munich leaves at 23:20 to reach Santa Lucia at 08:24.\nTrains to Vienna depart at 21:04 and arrive in Vienna at 07:55 next morning. The other way departs Vienna at 21:27, arriving at 08:24 in Santa Lucia.\nThe Thello sleeper leaves Paris Gare de Lyon at 19:15 and arrives in Santa Lucia at 09:35. The reverse trajectory departs Venice at 19:20, arriving in Paris at 09:37.\nAlso, Venice is the terminus for the luxurious Venice Simplon Orient-Express, a historical train that still makes the overnight journey from London and Paris in original 1920s coaches. There are departures at least once a week between March and November. As one of the most sumptuous journeys in the world, the trip is expectedly very expensive, starting at \u20ac2,900.\nTrains from the mainland run through Mestre on the mainland to the terminus Venezia Santa Lucia railway station on the west side of Venice; make sure you don't get it confused with the two stations on the mainland before the bridge. Many through trains only stop in Mestre, in that case just hop on to one of the very frequent trains to Santa Lucia (ticket \u20ac1.25). Also, ACTV has a ticket office at Mestre station, and queues might be shorter here. From the Santa Lucia station district, water buses (vaporetti) or water taxis can take you to hotels or other locations on the islands, but walking is usually the best option.\n\n2 Venezia Santa Lucia railway station (Stazione di Venezia Santa Lucia), Fondamenta Santa Lucia (Northern edge of Cannaregio district). The main terminus station located in proper Venice. The strikingly modern building was built in 1934. Stepping out from the station you are immediately met with views of the canals and historic Venice. The station itself has plenty of amenities, including lounges for holders of first-class tickets. There's a left luggage facility next to the track on the north side of the station (to the right when facing the tracks). Price is \u20ac6 per piece for the first six hours.   (updated Mar 2021)\n3 Venezia Mestre railway station (Stazione di Venezia Mestre), Piazzale Pietro Favretti. Main station on the mainland, many through trains only call here.   (updated Mar 2021)\n4 Venezia Porto Marghera railway station (Stazione di Venezia Porto Marghera). Smaller station on the mainland, only local services call here.   (updated Mar 2021)\n\n\nBy car\nDistances to Venice: Rome 540 km, Milan 279 km, Padua 60 km, Vicenza 75 km, Udine 125 km\nCars arrive on the far western edge of Venice, but remain parked at the entrance to the city (Piazzale Roma or Tronchetto, which is Europe's largest car park.) There are no roads past this point, and never were, even before cars.\n\n\nParking\nCar parking is very very expensive here (\u20ac26/12 hr, \u20ac30/24 hr) and the tailbacks can be quite large. Tronchetto is about a 1 km from Piazzale Roma, the city's main entry point, but there is a shuttle train service, People Mover, at \u20ac1.50.\n\n5 Parking Tronchetto, Isola Nuova del Tronchetto, \u260f +39 041 5207555, fax: +39 041 5285750, info-tronchettopark@interparking.com.

Park near the Mestre railway station, and catch a train to Venezia St Lucia; there are many trains, it is very near (8\u201310 minutes) and quite cheap (\u20ac1.20). Don't bother searching for free parking near Mestre train station - there are no free parking spots near, except on Sunday (free parking is on the other side of the station, in Marghera).

Zaccaria. \n\n\nCar rental\nMost of the major rental car companies have outlets at Piazzale Roma, at the edge of the city. These are on the ground floor of one of the major parking stations. When you are dropping off your car, you need to find street parking and then walk to the rental car outlet and hand in the keys. Do not park in the parking station. There is a vaporetto stop across the road from the parking station.\n\n\nBy bus\nFor bus services between Marco Polo airport (VCE) and the Piazzale Roma bus station in Venice, see the By Place section.

However, walking and standing all day can also be exhausting, so it is best to pace yourself. The Rialtine islands \u2013 the 'main' part of Venice \u2013 are small enough to walk from one end to the other in about an hour, provided you don't get lost (a common occurrence).\nIf you want to get around a bit more quickly, there are numerous vaporetti (water buses) and water taxis. The vaporetti are generally the best way to get around, even if the service route map changes frequently. If you are going to be in Venice for a few days visiting, it is a lot cheaper to use vaporetti than private water taxis. If you want to have a romantic ride along the canals, take a gondola ride, although they tend to exist for more scenic purposes, rather than getting people from point A to point B.\nGPS navigation services such as Google Maps are notoriously unreliable in Venice. The density of stone buildings makes it fairly difficult to receive a proper GPS satellite signal. You can mitigate some of these navigation issues using the Live View function in Google Maps, which uses your camera to orient yourself relative to businesses and landmarks around you. However, as of February,2024, Google Maps has been reported as to be working well for pathway navigation.\nThe one surprising way you can't get around in Venice is by bicycle. Bicycles are banned in the main city. You are allowed to carry your bike in your arms (not ride, not wheel/walk) from the pIazzale Roma to the Venezia Santa Lucia train station, and if you are traveling through Venice to reach Lido or Pellestrina, then you can carry a bicycle like any other large package on public transit. There is a \u20ac100 fine for riding a bicycle in Venice.\n\n\nBy public transport\nACTV runs the vaporetti and other public transport services in the lagoon and on land.\n\nLine 1 runs from Piazzale Roma to Lido, passing the Railway Station (Ferrovia), Canal Grande, Rialto, S.Marco and S.Zaccaria and vice versa, leaving Piazzale Roma every 20 minutes from 05:01 to 06:01 and from 22:21 to 23:41, every 10 minutes from 06:21 to 22:01, leaving Lido every 20 minutes from 04:16 to 05:36 and from 21:46 to 23:06, every 10 minutes from 5:56 to 21:26.

Information for all ACTV services at Hello Venezia \u260f +39 041 2424, daily 07:30 to 20:00. You can download a map of Venice water buses\nA single ticket (biglietto solo andata) costs \u20ac9.50, permitting the use of public transports for 75 minutes from the moment you validate the ticket including transfers heading in the same direction. If you board a boat without having bought a ticket, you have to buy one from the on-board collector. There are no return tickets.\nThere are tourist travel cards (biglietto turistico a tempo) that cost \u20ac25 for 24 hours, \u20ac35 for 48 hours, \u20ac45 for 72 hours and \u20ac65 for 7 days. There are other versions available, including those offering discounts for youth under 29 year of age. Current rates can be found here.\nSomething you won't be told easily is that now anyone can purchase the Venezia Unica City Pass card (formerly IMOB) - the only difference is that in addition to its \u20ac10 cost for residents, foreigners need to pay a \u20ac90 extra \"transport activation\" fee. Unless you are in town for a couple of days and planning never to return, do it. It's a durable plastic card with your (webcam) picture, and once you have it, you are more or less a local - which means access to \u20ac1.50 single vaporetto tickets (save even more by recharging the card with 10 at once for \u20ac14), half-price discount on Alilaguna services, and even \u20ac0.70 traghetto crossings (instead of \u20ac2; flash the card to the gondolier). It is valid for 5 years from the month of issue. Register at the Venezia Unica site and pre-fill the application online, then go to one of the ACTV offices (not simply ticket points; probably the easiest location is at Piazzale Roma) and tell the clerk that you have a \"contratto precompilato\" - they'll pull it up, ask you to sign the privacy disclosures and issue the card on the spot (or you can fill the form at the counter; bear in mind it's in Italian). Moreover, if you happen to have a +39 Italian cell phone number, with it and your new Unica you can get a free code for use of the communal WiFi spots. If you lose the card, do not despair: it costs only \u20ac10 to get an immediate replacement, and the balance (along with your old photograph) is automatically transferred over.\nThe Venice Connected website of the Comune di Venezia (now integrated into Unica site) makes possible to book online (at least 7 days in advance) most services controlled by the town administration (public transportation, access to the civic museums, access to public restrooms, car park tickets, entrance to the Casin\u00f2 and access to the municipal WiFi network covering the entire historic centre); the online prices vary according to the projected number of visitors but are always cheaper than the current on-site prices (and cheaper than with a Venice Card).\nYou can also get a Venice Card, which has various options that you can choose when you buy it (public transportation, cultural attractions, toilet access, Alilaguna, etc.) There is a 'Junior' version of the Venice that is available at a slightly reduced rate for those between 5 and 29 years of age. A Venice Card is not recommended for those with less than 3 days in Venice, as most of the top attractions are not included in the Venice Card. If you'll be staying in Venice for a week - get the Venice Card and enjoy travelling from island to island and exploring the various museums and churches it offers access to.\nMaps are available at the vaporetto stops in the ticket booths. The map is quite reliable, and is free when getting a Venice Card (\u20ac2 otherwise) can be viewed on Internet.\nVenice Cards can be reserved on-line  for a considerable discount. There are long lines when taking the Venice Card from the ticket booths. The Venezia St. Lucia ticket booth that offers Venice Cards is the one most on the right when you exit the train station.\n\n\nBy foot\n\nOtherwise, take a walk!  The city is not that big, and you can walk from one end to the other in a few hours if you stick to the paths conveniently marked with arrows in the direction of major landmarks. But it would take months for a fit person to discover every path in the city. Make sure to visit some of the smaller alleyways, as they can be very interesting. Along the way you will discover marvelous art, superb architecture and breathtaking urban landscaping. Exploring the city randomly by walking is well worth it, but also be prepared to get lost easily! Signs all over the city indicate the direction to the main attractions, \"Rialto\" and \"San Marco\", as well as the way back to the train station (\"ferrovia\") and the bus terminal (\"Piazzale Roma\"). These signs make it easy to have the \"get lost experience\" even as a one-day tourist. For a faster and safer walk, you should walk on the right side of every path.\nBe aware that addresses in Venice are of the form \"District Number\" (the Venetian word for district is \"Sestiere\"), not \"Street Number\". To find a specific place using a map, make sure you know which district it is in. The numbers are assigned at the start of the district and increase as they move farther away from the Grand Canal.\nTravellers with mobility impairments will need to plan their routes carefully and allow extra time. Although the city is nearly flat, moving from one section to another requires either getting on a boat or climbing stairs to cross a bridge. The water buses are generally wheelchair accessible, though a wheelchair user may not be able to board when they are crowded. A few bridges have temporary ramps, and the city plans to add permanent ramps to a few more. This should, hopefully by 2030, allow people to move between the most popular attractions in the city without climbing stairs, although some areas of the city will remain difficult to access.\n\n\nBy water taxi\n\nWater taxis (taxi acquei) are operated by Coop. San Marco (\u260f +39 041 5222303), Coop. Veneziana (\u260f +39 041 716124), Coop. Serenissima (\u260f +39 041 5221265 or \u260f +39 041 5229538), Soc. Narduzzi Solemar (\u260f +39 041 5200838), Soc.

There are supplements of \u20ac5 for call services and customer pick-up outside the taxi ranks, of \u20ac10 for night services between 22:00 and 06:00, of \u20ac3 pieces of luggage exceeding 4 pieces and of \u20ac5 or \u20ac10 for every person exceeding a group of 4. Rates are fixed by a resolution of the Venice City Council.\nA water taxi service for persons with special needs is available at \u260f +39 041 2747332 or directly through the website Book Taxi Venice.\n\n\nBy taxi\n'Normal' taxis can be called from Radio Taxi (\u260f +39 041 936137). There are taxi ranks at Piazzale Roma (\u260f +39 041 5237774) and Lido (\u260f +39 041 5265974).\n\n\nBy traghetto\nThere are small gondola ferries crossing the Canal Grande at\n\n11 S.Sofia, M\u2013Sa 07:30\u201320:00, Su and holidays 08:45\u201319:00\n12 Carbon (Rialto), M\u2013F 07:00\u201312:30, weekdays only\n13 S.Tom\u00e1, M\u2013Sa 07:30\u201320:00, Su and holidays 08:30\u201319:30\n14 San Barnaba, M\u2013F 07:45\u201312:30,\n15 S.Maria del Giglio, daily 09:00\u201318:00\n16 Dogana, daily 09:00\u201314:00\nTicket price \u20ac2 one way, \u20ac0.70 for Venice residents and IMOB card holders.\n\n\nBy tour\nAlilaguna Green line (linea verde)\nAlilaguna, \u260f +39 041 5235775, operates a 4 hours excursion tour to the island of Murano, Burano and Torcello with explanations in English, French, German and Spanish.

Ticket price \u20ac20 (free for holders of Alilaguna 72-hr pass).\n\n\nSee\n\nVenice is packed full of sights, with something interesting to see around each corner. The most spectacular sights, such as the Doge's Palace and Saint Mark's Basilica, are in San Marco, the historic seat of power.\n\n1 Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Piazetta San Marco, San Marco 1 (vaporetto line 1 or 2 to San Marco), \u260f +39 041 2715911. Nov to Mar 08:30 to 17:30, Apr to Oct 08:30 to 19:00, closed Jan 1 and Dec 25. Don't miss the guided tour named Secret Itinerary, which will let you discover the part of the palace where the city's administration worked, as well as Casanova's jail and the wonderful 500-year-old roof structure. A MUVE museum. Adults \u20ac20, reduced \u20ac14.   \n2 Bell tower of St. Mark (Campanile di San Marco), Piazza San Marco, San Marco (vaporetto line 1 to San Marco), \u260f +39 041 5224064. Nov-Mar: 09:30-15:45; Apr-Jun, Oct: 09:00-19:00; Jul-Aug: 09:00-21:00. The current tower dates from 1912; an exact replica of the previous tower which collapsed in 1902. The top of the tower offers great views of Venice and the lagoon. \u20ac8.   \n3 Clock tower (Torre dell'Orologio), Piazza San Marco, San Marco (vaporetto lines 1-2-5, 1.5.2 to San Marco), \u260f +39 041 5209070. Having been closed for restoration for many years, the restored astronomical clock is now visible. The fascinating tour of the clock mechanism (and rooftop bell) can only be visited on a guided tour, in English: M-W at 10:00 and 11:00, on other days at 14:00 and 15:00, in French M-W at 14:00 and 15:00, advance reservation required online or by phone at +39 041 5209070. A MUVE museum. Adults \u20ac12, reduced \u20ac7.   \n4 Scuola Grande di San Rocco, San Polo 3052 (vaporetto line 1 or 2 to San Tom\u00e0, near the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari), \u260f +39 041 5234864. Daily 09:30-17:30, closed Dec 25, Jan 1, Easter Sunday. A masterpiece of Tintoretto, this guild house is an exquisite example of Mannerist art at its best. In order to allow a comfortable admiration of the detailed ceiling, mirrors are offered to the visitors. Cycles of allegories, life and passion of Christ, scenes from the Old and New Testament. Adult \u20ac10, concessions \u20ac8.   \n5 Jewish Ghetto of Venice (Ghetto Ebraico di Venezia), Cannaregio. While racial and ethnic neighborhoods had existed prior to the Venetian Ghetto, Venice's ghetto was the first \"ghetto\" (coming from a Venetian word for the Iron Foundry that was on the site previously) and \"ghetto\" eventually came to mean any neighborhood that was made up of a single ethnic or racial group. Today, Jewish life is still very active in the ghetto, and elsewhere in Venice, and is home to five synagogues. Visiting on Saturdays or late Fridays (the Jewish Sabbath) will prove very fruitless because all shops, restaurants, and other Jewish places will be closed. \n6 Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge) (connecting sestieri San Polo and San Marco across Canal Grande). The bridge has become one of Venice's most recognizable icons and has a history that spans over 800 years. Today's Rialto Bridge was completed in 1591 and was used to replace a wooden bridge that collapsed in 1524.   \n7 Zattere, Dorsoduro. It's a long and sunny walk along the Giudecca canal, protected during winter time from cold northerly winds for being exposed to south and shielded by buildings. You might find interesting to see how a gondola is made, stopping by the Squero (Venetian for small ship yard) across the canal near San Trovaso Church. It's one of the few still in business in town. With some luck, you'll see some gondole through various manufacturing steps (note that gondole are not straight to counterbalance the gondoliere push). \n\n\nChurches\n\nA lot of churches will charge an entry fee. This is true of the Basilica di San Marco. There is a \"Chorus Pass\" for entry into some churches, but be aware there is a limited selection of churches this applies to. If you plan to visit three churches or more, you are better off buying the churches pass. There is also a combined pass for museums, churches and transportation only available at the tourist information office but it is relatively expensive.\n\n8 Saint Mark's Basilica (Basilica di San Marco), Piazza San Marco, San Marco 328 (water lines #1, 52, and 82 will take you from Santa Lucia (the train station) or Piazzale Roma to Piazza San Marco. Walking is another option but will require a map and lots of time and energy), \u260f +39 041 5225205 (procuratorial phone number). Oct-Mar: 09:45-16:45; Apr-Sep: 09:45-17:00. Saint Mark's Basilica is on the Piazza San Marco and is one of the highlights of a visit to Venice. As with most churches in Italy, you must be dressed appropriately to be allowed in; this means no short skirts or bare shoulders. You are not allowed to carry large bags or rucksacks inside, sometimes even small daypacks may need to be deposited. Storage is available just around the corner from the main entrance (free of charge). Filming and photography is forbidden so be prepared in advance. The visit within the basilica lasts ten minutes. Waiting for entry into the basilica can last up to five or so hours and it may be wise to use a ticket service to reserve your visit (reservation costs \u20ac3). Once you have a reservation you can take the group entrance on the left, where you hand in the printout of your reservation. As of April 2022 there is a small charge for admission to the basilica. Do note there are extra charges for the high altar and the museum. The museum entry is worth paying for as it allows you access to the balcony overlooking the Piazza San Marco; do note that museum access may be difficult if you have mobility issues..   (updated Nov 2021)\n9 San Giacomo di Rialto, San Polo. This church, built around 421, is possibly the oldest in Venice. It is most recognized for its 15th-century clock above the entrance. It is also recognized for the red pillars and beautiful gold accents around the church.   \n10 San Giovanni e Paolo (San Zanipolo), Castello. A fine, huge Dominican church with the tombs of many Doges. It shares its piazza with the fine Renaissance fa\u00e7ade of the Scuola San Marco and an equestrian statue of the mercenary (condottiere) captain Bartolomeo Colleoni. Look out for the testicles (coglioni in Italian - it's a lousy pun) on his coat of arms!   \n11 Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (Basilica dei Frai, often just referred to as the Frari), San Polo 3072, \u260f +39 041 2728618. M-F 09:00-18:00, Su and holidays 13:00-18:00. Last admission 30 min before closing time.

Adult \u20ac3, reduced \u20ac1.50.   \n12 Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Cannaregio. A perfect jewel box church, simple in form but ornamented with fine exterior marble facings.   \n13 San Simeone Piccolo, Santa Croce (located opposite the Santa Lucia train station across the Canal Grande). The last church built in Venice. One of the things that it is recognized for is the fact that they celebrate Tridentine Mass on Sundays. It is also recognized for its dome because it is used to make the church look taller than it is and the dome itself is entirely covered with lead sheet.   \n14 Santa Maria della Piet\u00e0, Castello. A church that used to house an orphanage and hospital in the 18th century, it is known among classical music enthusiasts as the church where the Catholic priest and composer Antonio Vivaldi worked for most of his career.   \n15  Convento di S.Francesco del Deserto, S.Francesco del Deserto. Tu-Su 09:00-11:00, 15:00-17:00. Old Franciscan convent in one of the most beautiful islands in the Venice lagoon. By donation. \n16 S.

Two events organised by Biennale are the Art and Architecture International Exhibitions happening alternately (Architecture Biennale in even years, Art Biennale in odd) but other fields are also covered - contemporary theatre, dance, music, cinema (Venice International Film Festival). Exhibitions take place mostly in two locations: 1 Arsenale and 2 Giardini. They are both worth visiting even when no event is scheduled. Arsenale is the largest pre-industrial production centre in the world, dating back to 13th century, and Giardini is architectural gem filled with national pavilions from different parts of the world, often designed by famous architects, it was a venue for the International Art Exhibition since the 19th century.\n Art Biennale (Esposizione internazionale d\u2019arte): April \u2013  November 2024, \u260f +39 041 5218711, aav@labiennale.org.  It is held at Arsenale (vaporetto line 4.1 and 4.2 to Arsenale) and Giardini (vaporetto line 4.1 and 4.2 to Giardini). The Central Pavillion and the pavilions of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brasil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Korea, The Netherlands, Nordic Countries, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela and the pavilion of Venice are located in the Giardini.

Annual festival that is world famous for the carnival masks.   \n Regata Storica (Historic fleet event): , \u260f +39 041 2424, vela@velaspa.com.  Celebrating a historic event from 1489, the regatta displays almost a hundred varieties of Venetian boats from the city's rich past. Large oarships, replicating ancient roman and medieval vessels, are rowed along the Canal Grande, followed by many smaller boats. There are several races, including a master championship for solo sculling in streamlined gondolini, painted in unusual white, pink, etc. colours. There are many excellent photo opportunities for this event. Early September. (date needs fixing)\n Vogalonga: 2, \u260f +39 041 5210544, fax: +39 041 5200771, info@vogalonga.com.  The yearly equivalent of a marathon run on water. Vogalonga competitors must row 32 km under 3\u00bd hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it). The official purpose of the Vogalonga was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers. Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practise duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues. Late May.

It's also one of the most expensive, as gondolier-for-hire business licences are limited to just 430 to 455 oarsmen in Venice, making the market artificially scarce and inflating prices. The gondoliers trade is shaped by 900 years of tradition: most are born locals, and it wasn't until 2010 that Venice got its first licensed female gondolier.\nShort trips of 30 minutes to an hour cost upwards of \u20ac100. A small comfort is that the price is per ride, and not per person. Most gondolas can accommodate between three and four people. Make sure you reach an agreement on price and time before you start in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. There are many tips on how to negotiate prices in guidebooks; some are pretty wild and even include walking away and letting them chase you. Whatever method you choose, bargaining with the gondolieres might knock \u20ac20-30 off the price. However, there's an informal habit among the oarsmen to cut the most interesting and little-known parts from the journey path for \"discount\" customers. Reduced rate riders get less marvel in exchange for a moderate price drop, which may not be worth it.\n\n\nVaporetto and traghetti\nIf you find spending hundreds of euros for a gondola to be a bit much, ride a vaporetto or traghetto instead. There are plenty of vaporetto lines that passe by interesting sights at a more manageable price of \u20ac5\u201310. Additionally, one can cross the canals on a traghetti, stripped down gondolas used as municipal ferries. In the 1950s there were as many as thirty, but now there are seven points to find them, with some only operating at rush hours. The length of any crossing is just a few minutes. Many visitors enjoy visiting the open air markets near the Rialto Bridge and there is a traghetto station there, at the Pescheria (fish market) joining the Santa Sophia church along the Strada Nova. You will notice that traghetti passengers tend to stand up, but if you are not comfortable doing so, sitting is possible, if you are careful.\n\n\nRowing clubs\nVenice is home to several expensive rowing clubs.\n\n\nOther\n\nSpend a day on the islands, mainly Murano, Burano and Torcello. There are boat services to all these islands at scheduled times, including between the islands themselves. Be prepared for long lines and long waits for the boats between islands. The Glass Museum in Murano and the Lace Museum in Burano are certainly worth a visit. In Burano you will find some of the most picturesque streets and houses, with each house sporting a different pastel shade. Its really beautiful. Though there is not much to see in Torcello except for the old church, and the supposed \"Throne of Atilla\". However, the peace and tranquility of the island is not to be found anywhere else in Venice! Torcello is also home to a very expensive Cipriani restaurant. But just walking around on these islands is a nice enough experience. If you've had enough of the hype and the other tourists, hop off the vaporetto at 'Cimitero', Venice's graveyard for a peaceful walk. There are many famous tombs, and the section dedicated to deceased children is particularly haunting. There is also a free toilet there.\nWhile going through Venice, make sure you take in the beauty of it all. Walk through the alley ways, and take the water taxi to different parts of the island, sometimes at night you can just go sit in an open area and watch locals and tourists passing by. It is wonderful. There are many museums and churches that are around the city that allow tourists to go in a visit. They are many great sights to keep you busy throughout your visit.\nThe \u201cSecret Itineraries in Doge's Palace\u201d worth a visit, take the visitor into the most secret and fascinating rooms in the Palace. It's better to book in advance.\nBecause Venice is now pretty much only inhabited by tourists and people serving the trade, it gets very quiet by 21:00 and there is very little to do in the evening (outside of eating). There are a few exceptions, like some classical music concerts, which most probably only play Vivaldi.\nIf you would like to have a guide to show up the highlights of Venice, you can choose between many offers. There are walking or boat tours, focused on shopping or history or for art lovers, and many itineraries.\nTake photos, using your camera or phone on every corner of Venice will inspire you. And if you have taken good pictures, consider entering the photo competition \"OneDayInVenezia\",  running all year round, awarding monthly winners, and dedicated to amateur photographers. The Grand Prize is a weekend in Venice, trip included.\nSend a postcard or even better, an entire letter dedicated to a loved one (the old \"snail mail\" one, not the electronic variety)! Venice has a long, celebrated tradition in postal services, paper and written communication in general (including one of the earliest medieval book printing houses).\nVenice it's also Riviera del Brenta old canals. The Riviera del Brenta is famous for its extraordinary Palladian villas along the Brenta river, its museums and historical buildings and it is 40 km (25 miles) from Venice. This Riviera and its mainland include 7 small cities: Stra, Fiesso d\u2019Artico, Dolo, Foss\u00f2, Mira, Oriago and Malcontenta.\nThese places are good for cycling excursions and to see antique Palladian Villas built on the Brenta river. In Stra village, there is the famous gardens of Villa Pisani and the museum of the shoes is in Villa Foscarini Rossi. In this last museum you can admire 1,500 models of Italian-made shoes created in local factories for major brands including Fendi, Genny, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Ungaro, Anne Kleyn, Richard Tyles and Vera Wang.\nIn Dolo village you can visit the square, old watermill (XI century) and big open air market.\n\n Teatro San Gallo, \u260f +39 041 2412002.

Their home ground Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo (capacity 11,000) is on Sant'Elena, connected by streets to the main east island.\n\n\nLearn\nVenice is home to two major (and expanding) public universities, Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari Venezia and Universit\u00e0 Iuav di Venezia. There are possibly hundreds of smaller schools in the city. Neither university exploits its name for merchandising, and \"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Venezia\" sweatshirts for sale at stalls are not only unlicensed, but there is no single university in the city with that name to begin with.\n\n\nBuy\n\nVenice has always been a city of merchants. Consequently, most of the Venetians working in Venice still own or work at a shop. The pride of the Republic of Venice was the extreme diversity and quality of goods and services which could be found in Venice. These days, however, mass tourism led Venice to be populated with many shops selling low-quality souvenirs. The local shops are suffering a lot from this situation and it is not easy to identify them within the crowd of shops selling harmful imported goods. Buying from the authentic local businesses has never been more important, as it is essential to the future of the Venetians and guarantees you to get the real thing and to have a much better experience of Venice. It is not easy, though. Thankfully, there is a social enterprise in Venice that works closely with the Venetian business owners (shops, restaurants and bars included). They have a certification process where the local artisan shops attest and commit to be selling products both authentic and sustainable as well as to give a 10% discount to the customers carrying a Venezia Autentica Friends' Pass (buyable online for only \u20ac10).\nEuronet runs the majority of ATMs within tourist areas, which carry both hefty ATM fees and extortionate exchange rates. To avoid the extortionate exchange rates, you should reject the first currency conversion offered to you, which will allow you to default to your bank's rate. When possible, you should use ATMs provided by actual banks and financial institutions. The Credit Agricole ATM machines are notable because they do not charge ATM fees or offer excessive currency conversion rates for most Visa Debit and Prepaid cards. \n\n Atelier Marega.

Just like in every major Italian city, you get the big fashion brand names. For label clothing shopping, the best area is that around the Piazza San Marco, where you can find Versace, MaxMara, Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton, Prada (and numerous more) big names. If you want to shop for clothing or accessories, though, you don't necessarily have to shop through the biggest names in fashion. In the Campo Santo Stefano and Calle della Mandola, you can get less famous or local boutiques, but you can find some excellent quality and/or unique items such as clothes, shoes, wallets or handbags.\nLook for the hand-made paper and the exquisite miniature buildings made by Moro. Watch out for fakes; Moro \"signs\" his name on the back. Also, beware of fakes and \"free\" trips to neighboring Murano for its famous glass. (See article for details.)\nTourist Traps: \"Coloured Pasta\" and \"Venetian Limoncello\" (not the original napolitan one) are not Italian food, no Italian would ever eat them, they are particularly made for tourists. For typical regional Italian food in food shops, check the labels to discover where they have been made.\nDon't miss the Rialto market on San Polo, the smallest sestiere. The Rialto market is for shoppers. To the east is an area of small shops and restaurants; to the west is the Rialto farmers' market. Shopping is slightly less expensive than in the tourist-filled Piazza San Marco.\n\n\nMurano Glass\n L\u2019Isola, Calle de le Botteghe, San Marco 2970, \u260f +39 041 523 1973, info@lisola.com. \n Archimede Seguso, San Marco 143, \u260f +39 041 5289041. \n Venini, Piazzetta Leoncini, San Marco 314, \u260f +39 041 5224045, venezia@venini.it. \n\n\nEat\nIndividual listings can be found in Venice's district articles\n\nVenice is home to a rich and distinct regional cuisine and there are numerous wonderful restaurants, including a few Michelin starred ones. However, the city is also home to many more mediocre eateries that will not shy away from serving you undercooked pasta for overinflated prices. This has led to it becoming widely regarded that the restaurants in Venice serve food of a quality and in quantities much lower than anywhere else in Italy. However, with a bit of caution and planning ahead you'll have many excellent experiences eating in Venice. Rule of thumb is that if there's a waiter outside pimping for business, it's probably best avoided!\nOne of Venice's trademark foods is Sepe al nero, cuttlefish and its ink. This intense black ink serves as a sauce and ingredient for polenta (corn meal), risotto (rice), and pasta. These dishes are normally indicated by the Italian words \"nella seppia\" (in cuttlefish), \"alla seppia\" (in the style of cuttlefish), or \"nero di seppia,\" (black of the cuttlefish). For example, Polenta Nella Seppia is fried corn meal with the black ink of a cuttlefish. Despite the intensity in color, the ink has a surprisingly mild taste. Other Veneitian dishes include Fegato alla veneziana, chopped liver, cooked with chopped onions and Sarde in saor: fried sardines, dipped in fried onion, raisins and pine nuts, spices and vinegar. \nFor snacks, Venice has its own version of tapas, the cicchetti. Often paired with wine you will find that most restaurants and bars serve some variant of it. There are also many 'bacaros in Venice, a wine bar that serves a wide selection of cicchetti to go along.\nWhat Venice is not famous for is its pizza, Italy is a big country and pizza is generally more of a speciality in its southern parts. While there are restaurants serving it and some even do it acceptably, don't compare it to other parts of the country. If you really are craving for pizza, try the local chain Pizzeria Ae Oche. Meals are plentiful and prices reasonable, look to spend between \u20ac5-10 for a pizza depending on how exotic your selection is. For Americans, you can find a place called Quanto Basta pizza that serves an American-style pizza with pepperoni and french fries.\nBe careful when the prices are on a weight basis (typically by the \"etto\", abbreviated \"/hg\". or 100 g). One dish can easily contain 400g of fish or meat (almost a pound) - coming to 4 times the indicated base price! Restaurants might offer low prices for food on their menus that they advertise outside the entrance, but they will sometimes compensate this by charging high prices for drinks (which is naturally *not* advertised). \u20ac5 for 33 cl of beer is not uncommon. Le Bauta, an eatery on Fond del Gaffaro, is a good example. Also, please make sure that you get your change back after payment as sometimes it may be 'forgotten' by the waiters.\n\n\nBudget\nTo save money at lunch, eat standing up - that's what Venetians themselves do. Every cafe, trattoria, osteria, enoteca or whatever it chooses to call itself is stocked at lunchtime with cicchetti - Venetian tapas, including tramezzini (triangular sandwiches on white bread), bite-sized rolls with various cold cuts, polpette (fried balls of minced fish or meat) and assorted antipasti. Order by pointing at what you want on the glass shelves, and wash the whole thing down with a glass of wine (un' ombra) or a spritz (made with, in order of bitterness and alcohol content, Aperol, Campari or Select). Bear in mind that as soon as you allow yourself to sit at the table and be waited on, instead of ordering and consuming your food at the counter, the prices for the same items go up - you can end up paying double. If you look at the (government-mandated) chart of prices stapled to the wall near the bar, you'll see 2 columns of numbers, accommodating this arrangement. However, sitting is worth it if you plan on staying a while. Some places will also serve free bread and water for seated patrons, but then there is usually also a small charge (\u20ac1-3 per person) for \"pane e coperto\" (bread and cover charge).\nThere are a few supermarkets in the city, so if you are in the need to save some money, these are an option as they serve a wide array of prepared and semi-prepared food. On the main street from the station to the Rialto bridge there is a Coop and a Billa supermarket. There are still many small bakery shops and \"biavaroli\" where you can buy bread, cheese etc., particularly near the Rialto market area. For fresh fruit (including chilled coconut) watch out for the street market stalls. There is always a boat parked in the canal on campo San Barnaba selling fruit and vegetables into the late hours.\nIf you want to buy water (Venice has excellent free tap water easily accessible at the numerous fountains located outside throughout the city) it is usually cheapest to get it at the supermarkets: there are Billa or Co-op stores located throughout the city, though supermarkets are often \"disguised\" in nondescript buildings in Venice for space limitations.\nHead to the Dorsoduro area of Venice if you want to save a few euros. It is located on the south side of the city. It has the highest concentration of places where locals, especially students, go to eat. Generally staying away from the main squares will be the cheapest option. If you're willing and able to walk around the town, some back streets offer the best food for the lowest price. Seeing the city from this vantage point is a lot of fun too!\n\n\nMid-range\nThe Rialto food markets are an absolute must for fruit, vegetables and cheese, but most of all for the huge range of seafood, much of it fresh out of the lagoon and still moving! There are a variety of small stores around the city that sell fruits and vegetables, but tourists will be hard-pressed to find them. Anything else you will find in the one of the few supermarkets in the city.\n\n\nSplurge\nThere are 6-7 Michelin star restaurants in Venice, with prices to match.\nNear the Rialto bridge there's a row of restaurants with tables by the canal, where you can have the quintessential Venice experience of dining by the canal lights. Although they do have waiters outside bugging you, some have pretty acceptable quality for price, which is almost always expensive anyway.\n\n\nIce cream\nYou will find ice cream all over the city, and you will hardly survive a hot summer day without it. Prices are \u20ac1.00-1.50 for one scoop, \u20ac2.50-3.50 for three scoops.\n\n\nDrink\n\nThe typical local drink loved by all Venetians is Spritz, which is a mix of liquor and Prosecco with sparkling water to top it off. Aperol Spritz is by far the most common but there are variants with Campari or Select too. Almost all bars in the city serves it with prices range from \u20ac5 to \u20ac12, depending on how close you are to the main tourist arteries. Spritz are usually paired with cicheti, the Venetian version of tapas.\nAnother famous drink is the Bellini was invented in Harry's Bar in Venice. It is a mix of white peach juice and Prosecco (the ubiquitous Venetian Champagne-like sparkling wine). Fermented at a low temperature Prosecco develops amylic aromas (fruit drops), though these perhaps mix better with fruit juices than does the more austere Champagne. Classic Bellinis should never be made with Champagne. Although by normal standards expensive, a Bellini in Harry's Bar (\u20ac17 for a 1.5 oz drink is obscene) is still much cheaper than on the terraces of similar '5-star' establishments in the city.\nA small Grappa is a common way to end meals, but be careful as it is brandy with 30 to 60 per cent alcohol.\nBeer in a small pub is about \u20ac5 for a pint (birra media).\n\n\nCoffee\n\nCoffee is everywhere in Venice, and both Venetians and the tourists avail themselves of the opportunities, usually by downing a quick dose at the counter (see warning about sit-down prices above). Rule of thumb: the bigger (and shinier) the espresso machine, the better the result. Espresso, the real Italian, is about \u20ac1 at the bar, \u20ac2 at a table.\n\n E Rosa Salva. One of the favorites is the mini-chain \"E Rosa Salva\", with three locations in the center - on C. Fiubera (from Piazza San Marco, take the underpass in the middle of the arcade, cross the bridge and take second right off C. Fabbri), Merceria S. Salvadore (off the campo of the same name), and right on Campo San Zanipolo (to the right of the church looking from the canal); the last one is a gelateria as well. For your \u20ac1 you'll get exactly 2 and a half sips at the bottom of a small cup, with rich crema and no bitterness. Assorted house-made sweets are \u20ac1.10. \n\n\nNightlife\nThere are a number of fantastic bars in Venice, most are small places with lots of charm. Bars that stay open after 23:00 are clustered around a few few late-night drinking areas in Venice. Notice that Piazza San Marco is not one of them, although it is very pleasant with many people wandering around late.\nThe actual late night scene is in either Campo Santa Margherita, where the student crowds from nearby the University Ca' Foscari in Dorsoduro hangs out; upscale Erbaria on the West side of the Rialto Bridge where the main vegetable market is held during the day and along Fondamenta de la Misericordia in Cannaregio. The bars along Fondamenta de la Misericordia is anchored by Paradiso Perduto, which features live music on most nights. There's usually youths cruising (in motor boats) along the canal, blaring Italian rap songs in Italian from the loudspeakers. \nPub crawls are best planned in advance, as there's a real risk of wasting an hour or two wandering aimlessly in search of a watering hole that's open, especially midweek. Most bars close at 1 AM, so make sure you notice which ones are open until 2 AM or 3 AM.\nThere's next to no night clubs in proper Venice, to get to those you have to follow the locals and head over the bridge into Mestre, or hop on the boat to Lido. Those looking for LGBT nightlife in Venice will be disappointed. Hop on the train to Padua instead.\n\n\nPubs\nThere are two Irish pubs in Venice. One is located along the Strada Nova in Cannaregio; the other one is the Inishark just before Campo Santa Maria Formosa.\n\n\nSleep\n\nDue to the historic city's constrained area and international popularity hotels are expensive. Bed and Breakfasts and guesthouses offer better rates. Real budget solutions (like camping and hostels) can be found in Mestre  (mainland Venice) and on the island of Lido. Alternative accommodation can also be found on the island of Murano. These are worth considering since historic centre is quite well-connected with buses and ferries, so staying further from the centre is not such a big problem, as for example it takes only 11 minutes to travel from Mestre to islands of Venice by train.\nIn the last few years, holiday or short rentals apartments have increased in number and quality, now you can rent (minimum stay is usually 3 nights) a Palazzo on the Grand Canal as a little flat near Rialto.\n\n\nConnect\nAs of Sept 2021, Venice has 4G from Iliad and TIM, and 5G from Vodafone and Wind Tre.\nThe city has been steadily building out the municipal Wi-Fi network, which now covers almost the entire area around the Grand Canal and some of the larger squares in the center. You can buy guest access at approximately \u20ac5 per day at the same unified Venezia Unica site where the transport and museum passes are sold. However if you only need occasional access, it may not be worth buying this as you can get free wifi at most accommodations and at a lot of the museums in Venice.\nVenice has several internet cafes, but they are much more expensive than the rest of Europe with prices for an hour of access around \u20ac6. Wi-Fi is only available at some of them. There's a wonderful pub, Cafe Blue in Dorsoduro, which has free (password-protected) wi-fi. Buy a spritz and a panini and go to town.\nAt the Telecom Italia Future Centre in Campo San Salvatore (San Marco) you can browse for free for one hour, once registered with your ID card.\nTo use an Internet cafe, buy a mobile SIM card or get a contract for an Internet connection. Personal identification is needed by law in Italy. Internet cafes will not let you use computers without a passport or national ID card.\nCalle Delle Botteghe on San Marco 2970 Venezia is a pretty art gallery type internet cafe with a book shop. It is on the expensive side with \u20ac3 for 15 min but you can just go in and play chess with a glass of wine.\n\n\nStay safe\nVenice is considered a safe city. You have to take the habitual travellers' precautions however. Keep your valuable items (like wallet and passport) close to you because there are pickpockets, especially in more crowded parts of the city.\nIn case of need, you can dial free of charge on any phone 112 (no area code needed) to contact Carabinieri or 113 (no area code needed) to contact the Police.\nSometimes, in the evening and night hours, Campo Bella Vienna and Campo Santa Margherita are places for violence, so be careful if you stay here.\n\n\nStay healthy\nDo not touch or swim in the extremely polluted water in the canals. Some of that water comes from the surrounding Venetian Lagoon, but the rest comes straight from toilets and kitchen sinks. Venice has begun to install septic tanks in buildings, but much of the city has not yet been upgraded and releases untreated sewage directly into the canals. Avoid bathing yourself, touching the water, immersing feet, etc. in the canals looking for refreshment in the hot season. Also, at night there is a risk of falling into the water, as there are many alleys which end in the water but have little or no lighting. In the warmest months, these conditions can sometimes generate foul odors. Choose other times to visit if they might ruin what should be a highly enjoyable stay.\nCurrent regulations forbid certain behaviour, including bathing in the canals and walking around in a swimsuit or bare-chested. Violations are subject to fines up to \u20ac500 and being banned from the city for the next 48 hours, even if you have a prepaid hotel room and non-refundable tickets to events. More information is available on #EnjoyRespectVenezia website.\nYou can reach the emergency medical service dialing free of charge on any phone 118 (no area code needed, conversation will be recorded) to have assistance and an ambulance sent to you.\nChemists' shops (Italian: Farmacie) are all around the town. They are open 24 hr a day, 7 days a week on a rotational basis: outside the shop there's always the list of operating ones with timetables, address and phone number. If you need a special drug you might be asked to book it in advance if it's not in common use. Note that the commercial name or brand of your prescription might differ from your country of origin, and make sure that the medication you want is available in the EU.\n\n\nRespect\nMuch of Venice's famous architecture is extremely old and showing the effects of being mishandled by the flood of tourists, some small fraction of whom behave as if they were in a modern holiday resort complex instead of an ancient city. To preserve the wonder of this city for future generations, everyone needs to treat the city's infrastructure as if you were in a large, open-air art museum.\nThe city officials state that it is necessary to enforce rules that preserve the city's urban cleanliness and make sure visitors behave themselves. The following tips will come in handy: \n\nWalk on the right side of the street; especially on narrower streets, you'll contribute to making your and other\u2019s walk faster, safer, and tidier. Do it always, even if the street is empty. Do not block the flow of traffic, especially on bridges.\nDo not bathe, dive into, or swim in the canals; it is not only dangerous and unhealthy (the canals are the city's ancient open-air sewage system, not to mention the mud churned up by the motorboat traffic and the risk of being hit by one), but it is also punishable by a fine of \u20ac350, and the police can immediately ban you from the area.\nDo not sit down or lie down on the ground, on monuments, on steps, on bridges, on buildings (or even lean against them), or sit in public on anything else except chairs and benches made for this purpose, and especially do not sit on the ground to eat. Picnics are banned in all public areas. They are punishable by a fine of \u20ac100\u2013200, and the police can immediately ban you from the area. If you need to rest or want to watch the people going by, look for one of Venice's bright red public benches to sit (but not lie down) on.\nDo not camp or sleep in public areas; the fine is \u20ac200, and the police will immediately ban you from the area.\nDo not walk around bare-chested or in swimwear; this is punishable by a fine of up to \u20ac250.\nDo not feed the birds or other wildlife and do not litter; the fines go up to \u20ac500. It may seem strange that feeding the birds has a higher potential fine than disrespectful stunts like climbing on top of a monument, but the city is located inside a fragile wetlands ecosystem, so please exercise more than the usual care.\nThe municipality of Venice maintains an up-to-date list of rules and regulations in English and several other langues at their official website.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nOrientation\nThe unfortunate side-effect of the small alleys which make Venice such a delight to visit is that it is remarkably easy to get lost. Even maps provided by hotels are frequently inaccurate, and the maze-like structure of the city can become very confusing. The tight cluster of little islands that comprise Venice is completely surrounded by the Lagoon, so it is not possible, no matter how lost you become, to leave Venice on foot. Sooner or later you will come upon a piazza that you can locate on your map.\nOne tip: as you cross bridges, note the house numbers before and after. A small change probably means you are on the same island/district and have crossed a \"new\" canal. A major change means you are now on another island. Most maps clump islands together into their voting districts, there are many more islands than districts.\nOne piece of assistance is to look for directional signs. These will be marked \"Per\" and then with the name of a prominent location or bridge in the city, complete with an arrow pointing in the relevant direction. Hence, to get to the Rialto bridge, the signs to follow are marked \"Per Rialto\". Those to St Mark's Square read \"Per S Marco\", and those to the train station \"Per Ferrovia\" (there are some others as well). Having oriented yourself to the nearest landmark, direction-finding can thus become (slightly) easier.\nRemember, though, that the signs to read are the official ones. Graffiti will occasionally give other directions, frequently incorrect ones.\nThat said, some argue that getting lost in Venice is part of the experience of the city. The number of photogenic canals, hidden restaurants and shops where glass blowing is done almost guarantees that there is no such thing as a \"dull neighbourhood\". Additionally, the public transport means that it is relatively easy to arrive at the intended destination even after one has emerged from the web of alleys in a totally unexpected place.\n\n\nOvercrowding\nWhile Venice may not get more tourists than other famous Italian destinations such as Rome and Florence, the narrowness of streets and open areas may at times make Venice feel uncomfortably crowded during (but not only) the peak seasons, at the San Marco sestiere, the surroundings of the Rialto bridge and the streets leading from Venezia Santa Lucia and Piazzale Roma to San Marco. Walking by itself can be difficult, let alone snapping a good photo, using a public lavatory, or sitting at a decent cafe or restaurant.\nTo avoid the worst of the crowds, unless it is winter, try to visit the San Marco and Rialto bridge areas during early morning and late evening. During the late morning and afternoon, stay away as far as possible from this area, for instance walking around west Santa Croce, north Cannaregio, eastern Castello and Giudecca. Alternatively, take day trips to places outside central Venice such as Burano, the Lido, Padua or Vicenza, or simply take the opportunity to refresh in your hotel.\n\n\nUseful telephone numbers\n Police (emergency call), \u260f 113. \n Carabinieri (emergency call), \u260f 112. \n First Aid (emergency call), \u260f 118. \n Venice Hospital, \u260f +39 041 5294111. \n Medical Service on Duty, \u260f +39 041 5294060. \n Tourist Information, \u260f +39 041 5298700. \n Gondola Service San Marco, \u260f +39 041 5200685. \n Gondola Service Rialto, \u260f +39 041 5224904. \n Gondola Service Danieli, \u260f +39 041 5222254. \n Airport San Marco Information, \u260f +39 041 2609260. \n Airport San Marco Lost and Found Office, \u260f +39 041 2609222. \n Railway information, \u260f 892021 (in country only). \n Railway Lost and Found Office, \u260f +39 041 785531. \n\n\nConsulates\nMost of the consulates listed here are only honorary consulates, so can only offer limited consular services.

Around the Venetian lagoon are other smaller islands, which have since been deserted but are worth a visit. There is also the Lido, which is a long narrow island with more modern buildings, hosting a youth hostel and a hotel.\n\nBurano \u2014 Island famous for lace, textiles and colorfully painted houses.\nLido \u2014 The island of tranquility, a beach district 10 minutes by boat from San Marco, and where the Venice movie festival is held.\nMestre \u2014 Town in the mainland, but still a part of Venice.\nMurano \u2014 Nearby island famous for its glassware.\nSan Lazzaro \u2014 Nearby island with Armenian monastery and impressive art collection, some world class pieces.\nTorcello \u2014 Nearby island with a 7th-century basilica church and an archeological museum.\nRiviera del Brenta \u2014 Palladian villas around Brenta River, 20 minutes from Venice by car, or you can get there via biking tours with a local bike hire shop.\nLake Garda \u2014 An easy day trip by train, it is Italy's largest lake and stunning in scenery.\nPo Delta \u2014 Peaceful and scenic marshy area southwest of Venice with bike trails.\nEraclea \u2014 Typical for its pinewood and Laguna del Mort, 55 minutes from Venice by car or by boat.\nJesolo \u2014 Jesolo is one of the most important beaches in Italy, just 45 minutes from Venice by car or by boat (ferry from Treporti to Venice).\nPadua (It. Padova) \u2014 40 km west of Venice, home to the Basilica of St. Anthony, the Scrovegni Chapel, and the oldest Botanical Gardens in the world, among others.\nCortina d'Ampezzo \u2014 Lovely alpine town, site of 1956 Winter Olympic Games. Great mountain scenery, might be very expensive. A couple of hours of car ride to the north of Venice, more than 3 hours by train and bus.",
