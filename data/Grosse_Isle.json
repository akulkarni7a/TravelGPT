  "extract": "Grosse Isle, an island of the Isle-aux-Grues archipelago in the Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches region of Quebec, is in the St. Lawrence River opposite the south shore communities of Berthier-sur-Mer and Montmagny.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe 21-island Isle-aux-Grues archipelago is uninhabited, with the exception of one tiny community (Saint-Antoine-de-l'Isle-aux-Grues) on \u00cele-aux-Grues itself. The region (Montmagny Regional County Municipality) is known for bird-watching, goose-hunting and cheeses.\nGrosse Isle (Grosse-\u00cele, \"big island\") was notorious for its role as disembarkation point for \"coffin ships\" \u2014 the overcrowded, disease-ridden immigrant vessels in which the starving Irish fled the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s. The island had been established as an 1832 quarantine station for inbound sea traffic to Quebec City during an earlier cholera epidemic, but was clearly unprepared for and overwhelmed by the mass influx of potato famine refugees in 1847. Medical care was primitive and housing and sanitation clearly inadequate for the tens of thousands of arriving travellers.\n\nThousands died from typhoid fever at the quarantine station or at sea. An estimated five thousand Great Famine victims are buried on the island, the largest potato famine graveyard outside Ireland. Thousands more were buried at sea before their ships even reached the New World. Of 90,000 who fled Ireland for Canada, an estimated 16,000 succumbed to the typhus epidemic of 1847 at sea, at Grosse-\u00cele or at a subsequent destination; among those who left Grosse-\u00cele seemingly healthy, 6,000 are buried at Windmill Point (Montr\u00e9al) and thousands more succumbed in distant communities like Kingston, Bytown and Toronto. Partridge Island, as quarantine station for Saint John, New Brunswick, was in a similar position with nearly 1,200 fatalities.\nGrosse-\u00cele is now uninhabited; the quarantine station, expanded with more adequate facilities for arriving ocean liners after Canada's confederation in 1867, closed in 1937 and is now a national historic site. \u00cele-aux-Grues is inhabited as a tiny village (year-round population: 130); the closest school is in Montmagny and, once the seasonal ferry stops running, students must be transported by aircraft.\n\n\nGet in\nAutoroute 20, a freeway, from Montr\u00e9al and L\u00e9vis passes through Berthier-sur-Mer and Montmagny on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River en route to Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup. Autoroute 20 is part of the Trans-Canada Highway between Longueuil and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup.  Access to the islands is by boat (seasonally) or by aircraft.\n\nBy boat\n\nCroisi\u00e8res Lachance runs seasonally from Berthier-sur-Mer to Grosse-\u00cele and \u00cele-aux-Grues; total cost per-person for boat and national historic site admission is about $60/person.\nL'Isle-aux-Grues \u2013 Montmagny Ferry, seasonal, free, provincially-operated car ferry. Runs 2-4 times daily, depending on tides.\nBy air\nAir Montmagny (+1 418-248-3545) operates on-demand charter flights year-round from Montmagny to the small landing strips on \u00cele-aux-Grues and Grosse-\u00cele.\n\n\nGet around\nThere is a 2.5-km Mirador Trail for hiking on Grosse-\u00cele.\n\u00cele-aux-Grues has several kilometres of roads suitable for cycling or motoring.\n\n\nSee\n Grosse-\u00cele National Historic Site, toll-free: +1-888-773-8888.

This town hosts an international symposium of direct-cut wood carving, which for eleven days welcomes professional sculptors from Quebec, Canada and abroad, who perform an original work in front of the public. There is a permanent collection in an open-air gallery, which now has more than 90 sculptures, which can be visited at any time on the banks of the St. Lawrence River. The festival is accompanied by introductory workshops on sculpture, artist conferences, exhibitions of works and demonstrations of regional wood carving and sand sculpture.
