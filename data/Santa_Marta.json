  "extract": "Santa Marta is a Caribbean beach city in the Magdalena Department of Colombia's Costa Norte.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSanta Marta an important commercial port and tourist destination. Every day, there are cargo ships coming and going and the action is very much visible. From the beach, the view of the Caribbean Sea is more or less to the west (beautiful sunsets) with a huge rock of an island jutting up out of the water to make a somewhat dramatic effect. Off to the right is the port snug behind another even bigger rock. This is a decent beach if you like beaches that are right in town with lots of people, vendors, and noise. Vendors are extremely aggressive if you are on the beach.\nAside from the old center, the main attractions of Santa Marta are its two resort-like suburbs El Rodadero, to the south, and Taganga, to the north. El Rodadero has several high-end hotels and private \"clubs\" that cater mostly to wealthy Colombians, whereas Taganga used to be a fishing village and is very popular with (mostly foreign) backpackers. Taganga has many scuba-diving agencies.\nThere is a high and low season. High season is December through April, with its peak from mid-December to late January (due to school and university vacations). In the low season the sun burns less due to more clouds.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar airport (SMR  IATA) (It is on the beach, 20 min south of town, but closer to most of the beach resorts and 10 min from the main beach El Rodadero). Has non-stop flights from Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn-Cordova, Bucaramanga, Pereira and Cali. If you get in from abroad check if baggage is unloaded in Bogota even if airlines promise they\u00b4ll send the baggage directly to Santa Marta. Inside the airport is an ATM of the bank BBVA. There's also a few restaurants located at the airport.   \nA public bus departs frequently in front of the Santa Marta airport. It goes to the main street of Playa El Rodadero and to the city centre to Carrera 4 and 5 (August 2021). The price is COP$2,500 (January 2024) and can be paid inside the bus. You can exit the bus anywhere, there are no bus stops. For the way back from Santa Marta to the airport the bus goes on Carrera 1, then Calle 22 and then Carrera 4 (January 2024). The bus has Aeropuerto written on the relatively small sign in the front window.\nA taxi to the centro historico is around COP$33,000 (January 2022, no prepaid or metered taxis available).\nFor better flying times or a better fare you may also want to consider flying to nearby Barranquilla. From there you can take a bus to Santa Marta. For international flights, there can be big savings when arriving in Medellin, Bogota or Cali and then taking a separate flight to Santa Marta.\n\n\nBy bus\n2 Intercity bus station (Terminal de Transporte). \nIt's all the way out of town on the main highway. To the city centre, take a bus that goes in the direction of Taganga, departing right on the highway (without crossing the street). The ride costs COP$2,300 (Mar 2023) and will take some 45 minutes to Carrera 5. If carrying a big backpack, you might be rejected by some colectivo drivers. Just wait for the bigger buses. \nWith a tax,i the trip takes around half an hour. In the bus terminal, you can get free WiFi at the tourist office. \nIf you want to stay in El Rodadero and come from the direction of Barranquilla, you can exit the intercity bus near El Rodadero and then take a bus or taxi to your accommodation. There is a city bus between the Terminal and El Rodadero, even though it takes some time as the bus goes through the centre of Santa Marta first.\nFrom Santa Marta centre to the Terminal de Transporte you can catch a bus/colectivo with the sign \"UCC TRANSPORTE\" on Carrera 1.\nBuses are available:\n\nfrom Cartagena: 3\u00bd hours\nfrom Barranquilla: 2 hours\nfrom Medell\u00edn: 15 hours\nfrom Bucaramanga: 9 hours, COP$80,000 (Copetran, Brasilia) (Jan 2024)\nfrom Bogot\u00e1: 16 hours\nfrom Riohacha: 2\u00bd hours\nfrom Taganga: COP$2,000 (Sept 2021) with minibus or taxi for COP$10,000 (Aug 2016)\nfrom C\u00facuta: 14 hours, COP$120,000-140,000 (Mar 2023)\nFor more comfortable road travel across northern Colombia, a few companies offer air conditioned van services between Cartagena and Santa Marta, with stops in Barranquilla en route. Cochetur seems to be the most reputable of these. They will pick you up and drop you off at your desired location in each city. You will likely share the van with 6-8 people including the driver. Tipping did not appear to be expected but a thousand or two goes a long way here.\n\n\nGet around\n\nStreets are numbered. The beach can be considered \"Carrera 1\" or 1st St., and the first street is usually \"Carrera 1A\" or 1A St. The next street after the first row of buildings is Carrera 2 or 2nd St. Calles are streets running from east to west. \n\n\nBy bus\nMoovit covers the area for finding connections. As there are no bus stops, buses can be entered and exited anywhere along their routes. The price is COP$2,000 (Nov 2021) and is paid to the driver when entering the bus.\n\n\nBy taxi\nUnlike bigger cities in Colombia, taxis do not run on a meter. Payments start at COP$6,000 (August 2021) for a \"lift\" (usually a ride no more than 10 minutes). \nIf you meet someone who 'knows' a taxi driver, this can be a good opportunity to negotiate a price to your next point in Colombia. Some drivers will take you as far as Barranquilla, although you have to negotiate.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Museo del Oro, Calle 14 No.2-67 (on plaza Bolivar). Displays a collection of precolumbian pottery, a nice collection of gold and a scale model of Ciudad Perdida. Free entrance. \n2 Simon Bolivar's place of death. The official name is Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino. Beautiful and very interesting gardens, lots of iguanas, study the map before getting any further. The guide will tell you only about the buildings and the history of the \"Libertador\". The entry fee is COP$23,000 (Sept 2021). \n\n\nDo\nYou can go to the 1 beach near the port. Nearby is the 2 Playa de Bahia. A bit more south you find the 3 Playa los cocos. All of them have crystal clear water. If in El Rodadero, you can go to the 4 Playa El Rodadero. And you can go to the beach directly at the airport. Watching airplanes arriving and departing while swimming in the sea.\n Scuba diving. Nearby coral reefs provide good possibilities for scuba diving. All the scuba diving operators are at Taganga, so you'll need to go there to shop around (prices are very different from one to another). You can follow the PADI course (3-4 days), or just go for a 1-day dive (no licence required). \n Jet ski. On the beaches, you can usually rent a jet ski in increments of 10 minutes. If you are not comfortable operating one, you can usually ask for a ride around. Life jackets are provided. \n Birdwatching. Birdwatching at the El Dorado bird reserve above Minca ProAves.

This large park in the mountains abutting the modern city of Santa Marta was established to protect spiritual centers important to the native Tayrona cultures. Many indigenous persons continue to inhabit the mountains to this day. The park closes periodically to let the land rest and recover its spiritual energies. Closing dates are: ** from February 1st to 15th (during the Kugkui shikasa season), ** from June 1st to 15th (during the Saka Juso season), and** from October 19th to November 2nd (during the Nabbatashi season) (updated Oct 2024)\n6 Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Natural Park. Mountainous area where the Kogi indigenous population live. The Kogi are part of the Tayrona culture. The park is home to a fascinating archaeological site called Ciudad Perdida with its many tiered terraces.

On Carrera 5/Calle 20 there is the 3 big supermarket Exito. Also the Olimpica supermarkets have a big variety of products. Medium sized supermarkets are D1 and Ara.\nSanta Marta is famous for its beach sellers. Since beaches are open 365 days a year, there are always people wandering up and down the beach selling anything.\nThe beaches in the southern suburb El Rodadero have aggressive sellers. Take this as an opportunity to haggle.\nPostcard stamps can be bought at the post office at Calle 22/Carrera 2 (COP$2,900 for Europe).  No stamps are sold at the Deprisa post office (Carrera 3).\nCarrera 5th is a big shopping promenade, with stores accompanied by street stalls and vendors.  Some streets are pedestrian-friendly, such as Carrera 3 between Calle 15 and 20.\n\n\nEat\nThere are a lot of eating options. They seem to be good at roasting and grilling chicken. They do a good job of grilling beef, tough but flavorful. Seafood is plentiful and relatively inexpensive with lots of shrimp and seafood cocktail vendors. Most varieties of fruit are available even those more common to cold climates. At night street vendors sell all types of snacks like pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries, shakes, kabobs, rice in coconut milk, fried stuffed doughy things, etc. Coffee, hot chocolate, and both hot cinnamon and lemon are omni-present.\n\n\nStreet Food\n\n\nCity center\nIn front of the big Exito supermarket you find Colombian style 1 grilled cut sausages and meat skewers.

V\u00eda al Edificio Cascadas del Rodadero, just out of town, to the south. \nBecause Santa Marta can get brutally hot during the summer (upwards of 35\u00b0C/95\u00b0F), it is a good idea to constantly have a bottle of water with you. During the evenings, when it gets cooler, beer and friends is often an excellent combination. It would be good idea to take a couple of \"Stubbie Coolers\" (Australian vernacular for an item which keeps the beer in your bottle cooler or longer) as the heat will have you drinking warm beer by the time you are at the end of your drink.\nSoft drinks can be found at nearly every restaurant - sometimes you can even pick it up in glass bottles. They are cheap.\nAsk about Ben\u00b4s Bar on the Beach. Barrio Samario, La Puerta, and El Garage.\n\n Juan Valdez Cafe, Calle 14 (next to the Gold Museum).

(updated Apr 2017)\n\n\nSplurge\n\n\nStay safe\nLike in other Colombian cities avoid traveling alone, with visible expensive electronics, esp. in public areas or at night.\nThere's a new walking path \"Sendero Peatonal Ziruma-Rodadero\" from the outskirts of the downtown area to Rodadero and the beaches there. While they cover a beautiful scenery often hard to admire by bus or car, it has long and desolate stretches and goes through some poor and unsafe barrios. There's very little police presence along the different paths. Do not use these paths alone as a tourist to get to or from Rodadero. Tourists have been mugged at gunpoint on those walkways in broad daylight. Take the cheap blue buses, or a taxi.\n\n\nCope\nMatters regarding your visa or visa-free stay are handled by the immigration office in Cl. 19 #8 - 68.\n\n\nGo next\nBoth hostels and private rooms are available:\n\n\nin the north-east:\nTaganga \u2013 5 km.
