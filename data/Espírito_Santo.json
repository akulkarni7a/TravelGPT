The origin of the capixaba people \u2013 that's what the locals are called \u2013 comes from a mixture of Indians, blacks and Germans, among others.\nIts capital, Vit\u00f3ria, stands out for sheltering one of the most important Brazilian ports, Tubar\u00e3o \u2013 and for offering excellent places for sports fishing. Besides, it is the second oldest city in the State. The oldest is Vila Velha, founded in 1534; but the hostility of the Goitacas Indians who used to live in that region forced the colonizers to move to the island across it. In the land dispute, the Portuguese triumphed and gave the new settlement the name of Vit\u00f3ria. The two cities prosper harmoniously, separated only by a 4.8-km-bridge.\nThe state of Esp\u00edrito Santo holds a very diversified industry, standing out as the one which has had the biggest economic development in the past few decades. Besides, the state is greatly responsible for the connection of the country with the international market.
