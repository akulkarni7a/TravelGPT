  "extract": "The Marshall Islands are a group of atolls and reefs in the Pacific Ocean, about half-way between Hawaii and Australia. The charm of the Marshall Islands lies not in a great number of attractions. This small country, home to fewer than 70,000 people and comprising 1,156 islands and islets, is, however, unique. Don't expect any spectacular sights, but enjoy the pristine beauty of picture-perfect tropical islands, great scuba diving and windsurfing opportunities and the warm hospitality of the people.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAfter almost four decades under US administration as the easternmost part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Marshall Islands attained independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association. Compensation claims continue as a result of US nuclear testing on some of the atolls between 1947 and 1962, which displaced some Marshallese citizens and exposed them to deadly radiation. The Marshall Islands have been home to the US Army Post Kwajalein (USAKA) since 1964. A number of islands are off-limits to tourism (and even to locals) due to US military presence or the residue of nuclear testing.\n\n\nClimate\nWet season from May to November; hot and humid; islands border typhoon belt.\n\n\nLandscape\nThe Marshall Islands consist of two island chains of 30 atolls and 1,152 islands, of low coral limestone and sand. Bikini and Enewetak are former US nuclear test sites; Kwajalein, the famous World War II battleground, is now used as a US missile test range.\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Marshall Islands website\n\n\nRegions\nThe Marshall Islands consists of 29 atolls and 5 isolated islands, of which 24 are inhabited. They can be grouped into two island chains:\n\n\nCities\n1 Majuro\n2 Kwajalein\n3 Ebeye\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nVisas\nEveryone is required to possess a valid passport. \nCitizens of the United States and all its territories, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of Palau, the Schengen area, and Pacific Islands Forum Countries including Australia and New Zealand passport holders can enter the country without a visa. \nEntry visas will be issued upon arrival to citizens of Japan, Korea, the Republic of China (ROC), the Philippines and some others provided that the duration of the intended visit is no more than 30 days and the visitor has a round-trip or transit ticket and a passport valid for at least six months. \n\nCitizens of countries not listed above must present a passport valid for at least six months with an entry visa and a round-trip or transit ticket before boarding and travelling to the Marshall Islands. The entry visa to Majuro is issued by their Attorney General in the Marshall Islands. It suggested that you email the Immigration Director to request the issuance of an entry visa upon arrival at Majuro Airport.  Send by email to agoffice@ntamar.net or agoffice@ntamar.net a request for issuance of a visa upon arrival and an attached copy of your passport, visa application, itinerary and entry visa to the next country stop. You will be given a confirmation via email on the issuance of the visa upon arrival. \nVisas cost $25 for a tourist visa that lasts 3 months. Business visas cost $50. Visas are valid for 30 days, but can be extended for up to 90 days once in the Marshall Islands. You must show that you can pay for your entire time in the Marshall Islands and that you can pay for a departure ticket, or demonstrate that you already have a purchased one. There is a departure tax of $20 tax, although those over 60 years old are exempt.\nIf you come from a country infected with cholera, you must present an immunization certificate. You must get an HIV test if you plan to work or live in the Marshall Islands, or if you will be staying for more than 30 days.\n\n\nBy plane\nFlights are available between Honolulu and the Marshall Islands and to Fiji via Kiribati and Tuvalu. United Airlines stops in Majuro and Kwajalein on its island-hopper service between Guam and Honolulu.\nApproximate flight times: from New York to Majuro is 14 hours; from Tokyo it is 11; from Guam it is eight hours to Majuro and five hours from Honolulu.\nInternational airports: Majuro International Airport (MAJ IATA). There are taxis and hotel transport from the airport to the town.\n\n\nBy boat\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy plane\nAir travel between the islands is provided by Air Marshall Islands. However, the company is fraught with financial and technical problems, and one or both of the two planes in the fleet are often grounded for days, weeks or months at a time.\n\n\nBy boat\nTransportation by ship is also available. Field trip ships travel throughout the islands, typically to pick up copra and deliver supplies; they usually provide passenger service as well.  \nTo give a sense of scale, the journey from Majuro to Jaluit is approximately 40 minutes by plane and 24 hours by boat.\nOn Majuro\nThere is a plethora of taxis available on the main road that travels the length of Majuro Atoll, and anywhere in the Majuro city area will cost no more than seventy-five cents. To get to Laura, on the other end of the island, there is a bus that leaves about once an hour from Robert Reimers Hotel.\n\n\nTalk\nMain article: Marshallese phrasebook\nMost Marshallese speak Marshallese and English. One important word in Marshallese is \"yokwe\" which is similar to the Hawaiian \"aloha\" and means \"hello\", \"goodbye\" and \"love\".\n\n\nSee\n\nWatch the sunset from your beachchair in one of the luxurious resorts or make your way to one of the more deserted beaches for a day of almost Robinson Crusoe-like tranquillity. On the far west side of the Majuro-atoll, the quiet beaches of Laura are a fine choice. If you've had enough of sun and sand, head to the capital Majuro for some shopping. \nHead to the Longar area on Arno, where young women were once taught the tips and tricks for a happy sexual life in so-called love schools. This is a perfect place for deep-sea fishing too. In Uliga you'll find the Alele Museum and Public Library. Although small, it has some nice artefacts of the nation's culture on display. Note the stick charts, used by the indigenous people to help remember the complex wave patterns between the many atolls.\n\n\nBikini Atoll Nuclear Test Site\nThe Bikini Atoll Nuclear Test Site in the Ralik island chain is the first UNESCO world heritage site of Marshall Islands added to the list in 2010. It contains many reminders of the 20th-century Cold War nuclear weapon race and the destructive power of nuclear weapons. Part of the landscape are sunken ships sent to the bottom of the lagoon by the explosions and a huge crater formed by 1954 Castle Bravo test.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe Marshall Islands use the U.S. dollar (\"$\", ISO currency code: USD). It is divided into 100 cents.\n\n\nShopping\nThere are some markets selling handicrafts and fresh produce.\n\n\nEat\nThere are many types of different fruits that are available in the different seasons. There are also farms that produce vegetable or raise pigs. Most, if not all, the produce are: breadfruit, pandanus, coconut, corn, tomato, sweet potato, cassava, papaya, pumpkin, \"nin\" (noni), lime, pigs and chicken. In addition to these, there are stands that sell fruit and traditional food along the road from Ajeltake to Laura. \nThe Marshall Islands was once known as the world's \"fishiest\" place, meaning that there was an over-abundance of species of fish that dwell in Marshallese waters. However, there is great uncertainty as to whether this is still true due to concern over overfishing and destruction of natural habitat by ships' anchors, harmful chemicals & climate change.\nThere are several restaurants that serve international food. The Marshall Islands Resort's (MIR) Enra Restaurant, Yummy BBQ, Jitak Take-Out, DAR Restaurant, and Robert Reimers Enterprises' (RRE) Tide Table are among the most well known.\nNon-Marshallese owned restaurants include Monica's (Chinese), La Bojie's (Filipino), China Restaurant (Chinese), Special Restaurant (Chinese), Won Hai Shen (Chinese), The Stone House (Japanese), Jay's Restaurant (Indian), Island Star Restaurant (Chinese), Eastern Restaurant, and Aliang Restaurant (Chinese).\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nWork\n\nIt is possible for Americans to get work on either Kwajalein or Roi-Namur Islands in Kwajalein Atoll. Only citizens of the Marshall Islands and US Military personnel are allowed to work at Kwajalein Atoll.\n\n\nStay safe\nBeware of storm surges or high tides. Flooding is common due to rising sea level.\n\n\nStay healthy\nTap water is not drinkable. It's recommended to use bottled water even for brushing your teeth.\n\n\nRespect\n\n\nConnect\nMobile phone service is available from the National Telecommunications Authority. Visitors with a foreign SIM card may receive a SMS offering a local number for use with their foreign SIM card. You just need to top up the account to activate the service. Follow the instructions in the SMS. It may take a few attempts to make it work.\nNTA offer internet through a chain of wifi hotspots.
