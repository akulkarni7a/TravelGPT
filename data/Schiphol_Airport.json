  "extract": "Schiphol Airport (AMS  IATA) is one of the busiest airports in the world. It is 15 km (9.3 mi) south-west of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. It serves the city of Amsterdam and the rest of the Netherlands. It is one of the major hubs in Europe with flights between many destinations in Asia, Europe and North America. It is home to KLM, the Dutch flag carrier. As of 2016, Schiphol Airport is the third busiest in Europe behind London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle and ahead of Frankfurt Airport as measured by passenger numbers.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nOrientation\n\nSchiphol has a one-terminal concept, which means that all the departure halls are in one building. However, this can mean long walks from one connecting flight to the other. The airport is divided into several zones. The ground floor before security has the entrance of the airport, the railway station (with the platforms underground), the four Arrivals halls, and Schiphol Plaza, the central shopping zone. On the 1st floor you can find the check-in desks and Departure Halls 1, 2 and 3. From this floor you can go to security and passport control if catching a non-Schengen flight and enter the transit area.\nThe terminal is divided into three lounges designated 1, 2 and 3. Piers (also known as concourses) connect to these lounges. It is possible to walk from one concourse to another, even to those connected to different lounges. However, keep in mind that if you're going from lounge 1 to lounge 2 and 3 you must clear immigration as you are leaving the Schengen area.\nThe exception to this is Lounge 4: it is only connected to Concourse M for low-cost carriers. Once past security, passengers in Concourse M cannot access any other lounges or concourses. Lounge 4 has very few facilities. If catching a connecting flight from one of the M gates, you must exit the secure zone though baggage claim and enter lounge 4 like any departing passenger.\nFew airlines and destinations have a dedicated concourse. KLM and Transavia use all gates except for Concourses H and M.\n\nLounge 1 consists of concourses B and C, dedicated to Schengen areas. Gates D59 through D87, the Schengen flights departing from gates D are reached by escalator from Lounge 1.\nLounge 2 consists of concourses E and gates D3 through D57,\nLounge 3 consists of concourses F, G and H. They serve non-Schengen areas. Concourse H is used by low-cost carriers.\nLounge 4 consists of concourse M, a dedicated Schengen area for low-cost carriers.\n\n\nHistory\nSchiphol opened on 16 September 1916 as a military airbase, with a few barracks and a field serving as platform and runways. When civil aircraft started to use the field (17 December 1920), it was often called Schiphol-les-bains. The Fokker aircraft manufacturer started a factory near Schiphol Airport in 1919. Schiphol's name is derived from a former fortification named Fort Schiphol which was part of the Defense Line of Amsterdam. Before 1852, the Haarlemmermeer polder in which the airport lies was a large lake, in the shallow waters of which sudden violent storms could claim many ships. This was the main reason for reclaiming it. In English, Schiphol translates to 'ship grave', a reference to the many ships lost in the area.\nKLM was founded on 7 October 1919 by Albert Plesman, making it the oldest carrier in the world still operating under its original name, though the company stopped operating during World War II\u2014apart from the operations in the Dutch Antilles in the Caribbean. The first KLM flight was on 17 May 1920, from Croydon Airport, London to Amsterdam carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1921 KLM started scheduled services, and by 1926 it was offering flights to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, Bremen, Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6. Intercontinental flights to the Netherlands East Indies started in 1929. This was for several years the world's longest scheduled air route.\nOn 1 November 1958 the airline opened the trans-polar route from Amsterdam via Anchorage to Tokyo. Each crew flying the transpolar route over the Arctic was equipped with a winter survival kit, including an AR-10 carbine for use against polar bears in the event the plane was forced down onto the polar ice. KLM merged with Air France in May 2004 to form Air France-KLM, but both airlines continue to fly under their distinct brand names.\n\n\nVisitor information\nAirport website\n\n\nFlights\nKLM offers worldwide connections. Asia, Europe and North America are particularly well served. Delta Air Lines connects Schiphol with nine US destinations.\nBritish Airways offer up to 15 flights per day to three airports in London. Transavia, Easyjet and other low-cost carriers provide a fairly economical way to city-hop to Amsterdam from other cities in Europe.\n\n\nGround transportation\nFor most travellers, the most convenient way to reach Amsterdam or other major destinations in the Netherlands from the airport is by train, with most destinations reachable either directly or with one change.\n\n\nBy train\n\nMost major destinations in the Netherlands can be reached from Schiphol either directly or with a single change. If you travel 2nd class, you can pay for your trip with a debit or credit card (Maestro, V-Pay, VISA, Mastercard) by tapping your card at the poles or gates. This system is called OVPay. Remember to check-in and out, and also if you change operator. See the OV-Chipkaart article for more information.\nYou can still purchase tickets at the ticket machines or ticket desks. There are machines in the baggage claim area, and at the train station (Plaza).\nAll machines accept Maestro, V-Pay, VISA, Mastercard and American Express but do require chip-and-PIN cards.\nIf you travel to Amsterdam, you can buy an Amsterdam Travel Ticket, which includes a train return ticket to and from Schiphol to any of Amsterdam's stations, plus unlimited travel on all GVB trams, metro and (night) buses for 1, 2 or 3 days.\nThe 1 Schiphol Airport station  is underground, under the main airport hall. Until a few minutes before arrival of your train, the departure platform is shown as two numbers. Information on displays and in the NS app is updated when the train enters the tunnel. It is the same platform, though it matters on which side the train stops. This is why you'll see a lot of locals and tourists waiting just at the end of the escalators or stairs. They eventually go to the right track when it is updated. \nFor most destinations there are 2 trains per hour, for more regional destinations trains are more frequent. There are up to 16 trains per hour between Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid in peak times. Regional trains run all night, although between 01:00 and 05:00 only once an hour. The price and duration of the journey are the same as during the day. However, trains for further destinations will generally not run at night. Check before you travel.\nInternational trains to Belgium or France stop at Schiphol.\n\n Schiphol to Amsterdam Centraal. There are plenty of direct trains from the Schiphol to the Amsterdam Centraal. A journey takes 16-18 minutes. \u20ac4.20 if using an OV-chipkaart; \u20ac5.20 single ticket. (updated Jun 2016)\n Schiphol to Amsterdam Lelylaan. If your accommodation is located near Vondelpark or Museumplein it's fastest to catch a train to Amsterdam Lelylaan station and connect to a tram from there. Trains leave every 5 to 10 minutes. \u20ac3.00 if using an OV-chipkaart; \u20ac4.00 single ticket. (updated Jun 2018)\n Schiphol to Rotterdam Centraal. If traveling to Rotterdam the fastest way to travel is by taking the IC direct that takes you directly to Rotterdam by high-speed rail in 24 minutes. Note that a supplement paymaymet is required. \u20ac14.80 if using an OV-chipkaart; \u20ac15.80 single ticket. (updated Jun 2018)\n Schiphol to Paris Gare du Nord. Direct high speed Thalys trains run from Schiphol to Antwerp, Brussels-Midi and Paris. Tickets cannot be booked by using the machines at the station and need to be booked in advance or at the ticket office. There is no set price so it's cheapest the earlier you book. (updated Jun 2018)\nAs of late January 2022, KLM offers customers who book a KLM flight to Amsterdam to also book a train ticket from Schiphol to Amsterdam Centraal Station.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe 2 bus station is located just outside the entrance of Schiphol's terminal building. There are buses to every destination nearby Schiphol, either direct or with a change at stops Beukenhorst or Knooppunt Schiphol Zuid.\n\n Amsterdam Airport Express (Bus #397). Connexxion operates a service between the airport and Museumplein, Rijksmuseum, and Leidseplein. The bus is only worth taking if these stops are closer to your accommodation. Buses depart from platform B9 daily from 05:01-00:21 every approx. 15 minutes. In the night bus #97 runs the same route roughly every hour. Tickets are sold by a marked minivan parked at the bus stop outside the terminal during daytime. \u20ac6.50 (from driver); e-ticket \u20ac6.50 (single) \u20ac11.25 (return) \u20ac1.00 (child under 11) or consider Amsterdam Travel Ticket. The fare is \u20ac3.55 if paid by OV-chipkaart. (updated Oct 2019)\nBus 300 To Amsterdam Bijlmer or the other way to Hoofddorp and Haarlem. Runs every 5-8 minutes or so and is useful for connecting with other buses and trains.\n GVB Bus #369. GVB operates bus #369 (branded R-Net) between the airport (Schiphol Airport/Plaza) and Amsterdam Sloterdijk station. Depending on your destination in Amsterdam you can save some time and/or save some money by avoiding travel with the train. The bus offer interchange with bus or tram #1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 27 along its route. See Getting Around part on Amsterdam page on GVB ticket. (updated Aug 2023)\n\n\nBy taxi\nDo not use a taxi unless there is no alternative; travel to Schiphol by train or by bus, if possible. Taxis from Schiphol are unexpectedly expensive.  You pay around \u20ac7.50 (as of Oct 08) as a minimum charge and that includes the first 2 km.  Then the meter starts racing.  The ride costs about \u20ac40-50 to go to, say, the Leidseplein.  Depending on the time of day and traffic levels, it could take only 25 min.  If you're unlucky, it could take twice as long.  Choose the nicest cab as that driver is more likely to be reputable.  You don't have to pick the first taxi in line. If possible, reserve a cab up-front, this will ensure a fixed price for the ride. If taking a taxi to Schiphol from the city there's a flat fee of \u20ac35. You can also catch an Uber from the city centre to Schiphol, there is no fixed price. There are also taxis in the form of minivans but those are significantly more expensive. Around \u20ac50-60 for a ride to Amsterdam, Hoofddorp, Aalsmeer or Amstelveen (all in the direct vicinity of Schiphol).\nThere is a way to get 50% discount on your ride to Amsterdam or 20% discount to other destinations. Look for an upcoming TCA taxi (spot the roof light!) at the departure halls (on the first floor). Say 'hello' to the driver while the passengers step off. This works out for you and the driver as he's not allowed to wait for customers at the airport and this way he doesn't have to drive back empty.\nOn Schiphol's bus station, there are illicit taxi drivers shouting \"TAXI!\" and waving a taxi sign in the air. Avoid them at all cost, they're scammers.\n\n\nBy shuttle service\n Connexxion Hotel Shuttle, \u260f +31 38 3394741. Serves over 100 city centre hotels, with 8-seater shared van departures about every 30 minutes between 06:00 and 21:00, cost to most city centre destinations \u20ac15.50/25.00 one-way/return\u2014more convenient than the train if you have heavy luggage and still cheaper than a taxi. Buses depart from platform A7 and can be reserved for the trip back \nUberBlack rides to/from the airport cost a fixed rate of \u20ac60.\nAmsterdam Airport Taxi Services has fixed rate Schiphol Airport transfers to or from the city centre at \u20ac49 for a Mercedes E class including a meet and greet special, \u20ac65 for a minivan.\n\n\nBy car\nIf you want to go to Schiphol in your own car, that is also an option, that could be especially convenient if you come from further away to get your flight and other options like taxi might get too expensive. This is the official Schiphol parking.\n\nP1 Parking: Directly opposite the terminal, P1 Parking is suitable for both short stays (up to 48 hours) and long stays, with mostly covered parking spaces. This parking area is designed to accommodate passengers who are either departing from or arriving at the airport for short trips, pickups, or drop-offs.\nP3 Long Term Parking: This option is divided into two sections: P3 Long Term Sheltered and P3 Long Term Unsheltered. Both offer long-stay parking (minimum of 8 hours) with a complimentary shuttle service to the terminal. The sheltered parking provides covered spaces to protect vehicles from the elements, while the unsheltered parking is the most cost-efficient option. Both sections include baggage loading points.\nP4 Basic Parking at Schiphol offers affordable, uncovered parking. After self-parking, travelers use a complimentary shuttle to the terminal, available 24/7 from the lot entrance. The shuttle operates every 15 minutes, taking about 10 minutes to reach the terminal. Reservations must be made on Schiphol's website, and rates vary by season and booking time, with limited cheap spots available.\nP6 Valet Parking: P6 offers a premium valet service where travelers can drop off their car at the terminal, and it will be parked securely by an attendant. This service is available for both short and long stays and features video street, GPS, and km tracker to ensure the security and monitoring of your vehicle. It's a convenient option for those seeking quick access to the departures area, as it's just a 2 to 3-minute walk from the terminal.\nThere are other companies like Mobypark offering Schiphol parking. They are substantially cheaper than the official parking as they have agreements with the surrounding hotels to use their parking spaces. This option is especially interesting for mid and long duration trips, the car can be parked for less than 9\u20ac per day and less than 100\u20ac per month. Some of them even include a shuttle service to the terminal.\n\n\nBy rental car\nIf you plan to rent a car for the duration of your stay, Schiphol has several car rental companies on site [1]. Typical opening hours are 06:00-23:00 daily. The car rental desk can be found in Schiphol Plaza, on the same level as the Arrivals. The A4 motorway leads straight from Schiphol to the Amsterdam ring road A10, in about 10 min.\n\n\nBy bike\nIf you decided to bring your bicycle on the plane with you, there is a 15-km sign-posted bike route from the airport to Amsterdam. Turn right as you leave the airport terminal: the cycle path starts about 200 m down the road. There is a map of the cycle paths around Schiphol available on this PDF (green lines are cycle paths). The part directly at Schiphol Plaza is illogical and confusing, as there are no bike lanes and directions, and there are frequent diversions because of building projects.\n\n\nGet around\nThe airport is one large terminal, so you never need to leave the building or take a shuttle train. However you can only get around on foot (and travelator, such as the hallway to Concourse B). Expect to walk long distances. This is especially true if you arrive on a Schengen flight and connect to a non-Schengen flight or the other way around, likely in another concourse (pier).\nIf you are departing, you will go through security first and then passport check if exiting the Schengen area. EU, EEA, Swiss can use fully automated e-gates on departure and arrival. When departing through Schiphol, American, Australian, Canadian, Hong Konger, Japanese, New Zealander and South Korean citizens can use automated immigration facilities in a separate queue. A border agent will still manually stamp your passport after using the machine. Other nationalities will go through another line where manual passport inspection by a border agent takes place.\nDuring busy times (such as the rush around 06:00-09:00), the separate security and passport sessions can take 20-30 or more minutes. Choose flights with adequate connection times.\nSchiphol had a major redesign of its concourses to simplify security procedures, which are no longer conducted at the gates. Because the Netherlands is a part of the Schengen area, connecting to a Schengen destination one has to clear immigration at Schiphol even if the Netherlands isn't your final destination in Schengen:\n\nIf you are staying within the Schengen area, you will not clear immigration, if departing from Schiphol you will pass security. If connecting through Schiphol, you will not go through security.\nFor example, if you are flying in from Spain and connecting to Sweden you will not pass security or immigration.\nIf you arrive from a non-Schengen country that has as strict or more strict security procedures than Schiphol (usually the US, UK or Canada), then you will not pass through security again at Schiphol. However you will need to use the Passport Control to cross into the Schengen Zone for most European connections.\nFor example: if you fly in from the United States and are taking a connecting flight to Italy. You will not pass security but will pass through immigration as you are entering the Schengen area in Amsterdam.\nFor example: if you fly in from the United States and are taking a connecting flight to Morocco You will not go through security and immigration as you're not entering the Schengen zone.\nIf you arrive from Africa, Asia, or most other nations outside the EU (except the US and Canada), then you will be guided through security processing. There are separate security sections based on whether you will be staying in Schengen or remaining outside of it. If you are entering the Schengen area you'll also pass immigration.\nFor example: if you fly in from South Africa and are heading to Canada, you will go through security but not through immigration as you are traveling between non-Schengen countries.\nFor example: if you fly in from South Africa and are heading to Germany, you will go through both security and immigration as you're entering the Schengen area in Amsterdam\n\n\nWait\n\n\nBefore security\n Panorama Terrace (Panoramaterras), 3F (go upstairs from Schiphol Plaza between Arrivals 1 and 2 or at Arrivals 3). Nov-Mar 09:00-17:00, Apr-Oct 07:00-20:00. The panorama terrace at the top floor oversees planes arriving and leaving gates C, D, E and F. Bring your camera or use the telescopes.

Free. \n Airport Park, Lounge 1, Schiphol World Avenue (between Het Palais and the Passport Control to Lounge 2). 24 hours. Who would expect a city park right inside an airport terminal?

Still, it's the one of the most tranquil environments you'll find in an airport serving millions of travelers each year. Free. (updated Oct 2017)\n Holland Casino, Holland Boulevard, Schiphol World Avenue (between gates E and F). 06:30-19:30 daily. A full casino within the airport's terminal walls.

At the entrance to pier F there is a fountain and bottle refill under the stairs leading to the Mercure Hotel (outside the toilets).\n\n\nBuy\nThe most important thing you need to remember in these European airports is the duty laws for the nation it applies to. There are many shopping options in the airport, though.\n\n1 Albert Heijn. Average sized supermarket located before security in the Plaza area between the train station and departures.

Reachable by covered walkway from arrivals. \u20ac180-650. (updated Nov 2017)\n\n\nFurther afield\nAmsterdam is the obvious place to look for further hotel options.  However, if you simply need a place to stay before or after your flight and don't need to visit Amsterdam specifically, you might consider some of the smaller cities that are easily accessible by rail from the airport.  In particular, Leiden (15 minutes), Utrecht (30 minutes), Den Haag (35 minutes), and Delft (40 minutes) are reachable without transfers, and the savings on your hotel room will often more than make up for the train fare.\n\n\nStay safe\nWatch out for pickpockets and baggage thieves on trains: a common trick is a knock on your window to distract you, so that an accomplice can steal your luggage or laptop. Another one is to have an accomplice jam the doors and then steal your luggage. The thief jumps out and the door immediately closes, making it impossible to catch them.\nHowever, railway police have made a great effort to reduce this sort of crime; nowadays it is at 'normal', big-city like levels. It however is recommended not to leave your baggage unattended. This is also announced in the station regularly.\n\n\nGo next\nSchiphol was built on reclaimed land, and so are the suburban cities around it. Hoofddorp is the closest town, but it only has a few hotels that could be of use. The most popular attractions for tourists are in Amsterdam, a 20-minute train ride.",
