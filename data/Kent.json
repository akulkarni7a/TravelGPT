  "extract": "Kent is the most south-easterly county of England. It is popularly known as the \"Garden of England\" and its coastal areas are popular with visitors.\n\n\nCities, towns and villages\n\n\nCity\n1 Canterbury \u2013 historic city,  UNESCO World Heritage Site and seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n\nTowns\n2 Maidstone \u2013 the administrative capital\n3 Ashford\n4 Broadstairs\n5 Chatham \u2013 one of the Medway Towns\n6 Dartford\n7 Deal\n8 Dover \u2013 town and major ferry port for the UK\n9 Faversham\n10 Folkestone\n11 Gillingham \u2013 one of the Medway Towns\n12 Gravesend\n13 Hythe\n14 Margate\n15 Rainham \u2013 one of the Medway Towns\n16 Ramsgate\n17 Rochester \u2013 one of the Medway Towns\n18 Royal Tunbridge Wells\n19 Sandwich\n20 Sevenoaks\n21 Sittingbourne\n22 Strood \u2013 one of the Medway Towns\n23 Tonbridge\n24 Westerham\n25 Whitstable\n26 Wye  - Britain's smallest town\n\n\nVillages and areas\n\n27 Biddenden \n28 Cliffe \n29 Cranbrook\n30 Elham \n31 Eynsford - with Lullingstone Roman Villa\n32 Headcorn \n33 Isle of Sheppey\n34 Otford\n35 Romney Marsh (area)\n36 Pluckley \n37 Tenterden\n\n\nUnderstand\nIn the 5th-10th centuries CE, Kent was one of the kingdoms of the Jutes, although its name derives from one of the Celtic tribes of Britain, the Cantiaci. As the closest part of England to the continent of Europe (it is just 21 miles (34 km) from Dover to Calais), it has historically been the focal point for invasion attempts, and is traditionally the major embarkation point for travel to mainland Europe.\nDue to the extensive agriculture, orchards and hop farms, Kent is part of what is known as the \"Garden of England\", a fact reflected in the new car registration plates - the letter representing Kent is \"G\" for \"Garden\" rather than \"K\" for \"Kent\".\nAt the eastern extreme of Kent lies the Isle of Thanet. There are three main seaside towns in the area: Ramsgate, Broadstairs and Margate. Once it was an island, but deposition over many years means it is now joined to the Great British mainland.\n\n\nVisitor information\nKent Tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nBy public transport all the London airports have similar travel times to Kent, as you have to go into central London then head out again.\n1 Gatwick Airport (LGW IATA) is the closest by road, 30 min drive from Kent's western boundaries if the traffic is good, but by rail you change in London.\nLydd Airport, also fancifully called \"London Ashford Airport\", had flights to Le Touquet in France, but these ceased in 2018. The airport remains open to private aviation.\nLots of small airfields remain available for private light aviation, but don't wander across these crowded skies without authorisation.\n\n\nBy train\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain\nKent has an extensive rail network, with lines running all along the coast and up through all the major towns and into London. The London terminus stations into which Kent rail services operate are Victoria, Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Waterloo East, London Bridge, Blackfriars and St.Pancras International.\n\nEbbsfleet and Ashford International Stations are railway stations which provide transport between UK and Europe. Several trains operate each hour direct to Ebbsfleet, Ashford and Paris, Lille or Brussels. Ebbsfleet is located on purpose developed land, with onsite car parking for over 9000 vehicles.\nDomestic trains are operated by SouthEastern From London St Pancras to Ebbsfleet (typical journey time 15 \u2013 17 minutes) and Ashford (typical journey time from St. Pancras being 30 minutes). The new high-speed trains on the St Pancras International routes have a full timetable. The high speed services have been further extended to Gravesend, the Medway towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Whitstable, Herne Bay and stations to Margate and Ramsgate. An off-peak service operates via Gravesend and the Medway towns, terminating at Faversham. A high speed service is be offered to the Thanet towns via Ashford and Canterbury West, bringing the Cathedral city within an hour from London.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Junction 5 of the M25 the A21 leads to Hastings via Sevenoaks, Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells.\nFrom London, take the A2 arterial road from either London or the M25 Orbital motorway to Ebbsfleet.\nThe M20 leads from the M25 to Dover and Folkestone via Maidstone and Ashford.\n\n\nBy boat\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\n\nThere are two main northwest-southeast motorways: the M2/A2, which serves Dartford, the Medway towns, Canterbury, and Dover, and the M20/A20, which serves Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Ashford, Folkestone, and Dover. Journeys along other axes are usually on smaller roads at a more sedate speed.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nNational Cycle Route 1 connects London, the Medway Towns, Canterbury and Dover. It is signed throughout although its quality is variable, with a mix of cycle tracks, quiet roads and a few off-road sections.\n\n\nBy bus\nMost buses are operated by Arriva in West Kent, Maidstone and Medway, and Stagecoach in the eastern half of Kent. Both operators accept contactless payment. There are some routes into South East London from Bluewater and Dartford.\n\n\nBy train\nA network of frequent train services is operated as part of the National Rail network by Southeastern. Times can be checked and journeys planned at the  National Rail website. However the network is designed to get people to and from London, and journeys across the county can be more difficult. A rover ticket is available giving three days of off peak travel (after 9.30AM) in the county for \u00a339.50 - buy it a station ticket office in Kent.\nThe county is also served by the High Speed 1 line, with fast services through Ebbsfleet, Ashford, Folkestone, Dover, and Canterbury.\n\n\nSee\nIn Dover, Dover Castle has 2,000 years of history contained within its walls, including a Roman lighthouse, a Saxon church and a Norman keep. The White Cliffs of Dover are spectacular chalk cliffs over which was fought the Battle of Britain.\nThere are three other castles that are well-worth visiting: Hever Castle south of Sevenoaks is where Henry VIII spent his honeymoons; Leeds Castle near Maidstone was built in 1119 and held by six medieval queens; and Scotney Castle near Tunbridge Wells is a very small castle with well-managed gardens.\nSissinghurst Castle Gardens near Cranbrook were designed by Vita Sackville-West around the ruin of an Elizabethan manor house.\nThere are cathedrals at Canterbury and Rochester. The windows of All Saints Church at Tudeley were decorated by Polish-French artist Marc Chagall.\nThe county has many stately homes to visit. Knole House in Sevenoaks is one of England's largest country houses with surrounding 1000-acre deer park. Near Royal Tunbridge Wells, Bedgebury National Pinetum has outdoor activities, and Finchcocks  hosts a music museum and Georgian manor house.  Chartwell near Westerham was home of Sir Winston Churchill from 1922 until his death in 1965. Penshurst Place near Tonbridge is a stately home and garden.\nChiddingstone, a village in the borough of Sevenoaks, is described as being the most perfect surviving example of a Tudor village in the United Kingdom.\n\n\nRailways and engineering\nThe Historic Dockyard in Chatham.\nRomney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway is a historical light railway with steam and diesel locomotives.  The line runs from Hythe to the nature reserve at Dungeness. \nKent & East Sussex Railway operates between Tenterden and Bodiam, passing through some very attractive countryside in the process.  There is also a museum at Tenterden station.  Bodium Castle is a short walk from the station there.\nEast Kent Railway was built to serve the Kent Coalfield which was closed in the 1980s. The site also has two miniature railways, a model railway and woodland walk. A cafe is available at Shepherdswell.\n\n\nDo\nWatch cricket: Kent CCC play at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.\n\n\nEat\nDespite the proximity to London, Kent still has extensive agriculture. Fruit grown in Kent (particularly apples and plums) can be bought all over the UK. If you want to take this seriously, visit the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale Farm, near Faversham.\n\n\nDrink\nKent-based Shepherd Neame in Faversham is the oldest brewing company in Britain.\nWine: Kent has many vineyards, as the climate and terrain are similar to northern France. Some well-regarded examples are Simpsons near Canterbury, Chapel Down in Tenterden and Balfour near Tonbridge.\nCider is produced from Kentish apples by some companies.  Biddenden near Tenterden is known locally for its cider and wine production.\n\n\nStay safe\nKent is generally safe and you are unlikely to experience any trouble during your visit.\n\n\nGo next\nEast Sussex lies to the west, and Surrey and London to the north. France, The Netherlands and Belgium are just a short hop over the channel.\nBodiam Castle, Batemans, Pashley Manor Gardens, near the East Sussex/Kent border.",
