  "extract": "Ubatuba is a municipality on the northern coast of S\u00e3o Paulo state, on the border with the Rio de Janeiro state. Ubatuba is a true paradise, being predominantly covered by exuberant Atlantic rainforest and containing more than 80 non-contiguous beaches distributed along 100 km of coast. You may find some of them completely deserted, especially on low season.\n\n\nUnderstand\nIn 2020, it was home to 92,000 people.\n\n\nHigh vs. low season\nUbatuba is devoted to tourism, but the fact that it is relatively far from both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (despite being almost exactly between them) makes it far more a \"vacation or holiday\" destination than a \"weekend destination\".\nFor that reason, during summer vacation (Jan-Feb) and holidays, the city and the more central beaches will be packed, and congestion in the Rio-Santos road may frequently occur. However, during the rest of the year, especially during weekdays, the city will be almost empty, and some beaches far from the city center may even be completely deserted.\nThe low season is thus great if you want tranquility, but in the other hand, the city center will be far less vivid, and it may be very difficult to find something to eat or drink outside it. Many shops, kiosks and restaurants close during low season.\n\n\nClimate\nUbatuba is humorously referred by Paulistas as \"Ubachuva\" (chuva means rain in Portuguese) due to the good chance of raining when they get there. In reality, this reputation is likely due to the city being most visited between December and March (the summer), which coincides with the rainy season. Winter months (between June and August) have little rain, but the average temperature goes below 20\u00b0C. However, there is usually plenty of sunshine hours year-round.\n\n\nTourist information\n Ubatuba Tourist Information, \u260f +55 12 3833-9123. \n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy bus\n1 Rodovi\u00e1ria de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, Avenida Professor Thom\u00e1z Galhardo. The bus station has connections to many places around Ubatuba: to Rio de Janeiro at 11:00 and 23:59, to Paraty at 09:50 and 17:00, to Taubat\u00e9/Guar\u00e1 at 08:30 and 18:10, to S\u00e3o Paulo at 05:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00, 17:00 and 19:00, to S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos 3 buses per day. (updated Mar 2019)\nFrom specific destinations:\n\nBuses stop en-route between Rio de Janeiro and Santos. Buses from Rio go at 08:30 and 23:00 (R$100). Direct buses from Paraty are also available, R$15.\nFrom S\u00e3o Paulo, you can take an intercity bus at Terminal Tiet\u00ea. Many buses go via S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (for Ilhabela), R$70-80.\nFrom the International Airport (GRU) at S\u00e3o Paulo City there is a bus line from Expresso Rodovi\u00e1rio Litoranea. They come to Caraguatatuba, which is a neighboring city, about 43 km from Ubatuba. There are only four departures from the airport to Caragu\u00e1: 07:00, 11:00, 16:30, and 20:00. From the airport to Caragu\u00e1 it takes about 3 hours by bus. The bus ticket is about R$35 per person.\n\n\nBy car\nBy car, from S\u00e3o Paulo or S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, you may take either Tamoios (SP-099) and after Rio-Santos (BR-101) or Osvaldo Cruz (SP-099). Journey from S\u00e3o Paulo to the city center of Ubatuba should take about 3 hours in good traffic conditions.\n\n\nBy plane\n2 Ubatuba Airport/Gast\u00e3o Madeira (UBT  IATA). Ubatuba has an airport near the city center. However, only helicopters, single-engine aircraft and small twin-engined aircraft are able to take off and to land due to the small extension of the runway. It is possible to charter a flight in a few airports such as the Campo de Marte Airport in S\u00e3o Paulo.   (updated Mar 2019)\nFor reaching Ubatuba with a scheduled flight the airports of S\u00e3o Paulo are the most convenient. Further flight connections you can find to Rio. For heading towards Ubatuba you can take an intercity bus or shared ride with Blablacar.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\nUbatuba has about 100 km of coast, so if you plan to check out the beaches far from the city center, a car is highly recommended. You can rent a car in the city if you are not up to driving 3 hours from S\u00e3o Paulo (which can become much more in holidays). If you are going to Ubatuba in low season, and you are not staying in the city center, a car is also a good idea, since you may find out that where you are staying there is no place to go out to eat, sometimes not even a supermarket.\n\n\nBy bus\nPublic transport is administrated by Verdebus. There are some buses that go to more remote beaches, but they are not very frequent and they may stop not at the beach itself but rather at a nearby village. Be sure to check these things in advance.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nAmogn locals, bicycles are a very popular means of transport. However, the beaches of Ubatuba are not contiguous, requiring a cyclist to ride in the sides of the Rio-Santos road to move between them, which is not particularly safe, despite being done by locals. Also, Ubatuba is quite hilly!\nCycling in the city center of Ubatuba, however, is much easier. The area is flat and there is a fair amount of cycleways.\n\n\nSee\n\n Prumirim Waterfall (Cachoeira do Prumirim), Rio-Santos (BR101) (19 km north from city center, near Prumirim bridge). It is actually a sequence of waterfalls, surrounded by exhuberant rainforest. Easily accessible by a short trail from the Rio-Santos road; check the signs for \"Cachoeira de Prumirim\". It is possible to swim, but some care, specially with children, is advised. \n1 Automobile Museum (Museu do Autom\u00f3vel), Rua Tapaj\u00f3s 65 - Itagu\u00e1, \u260f +55 12 3832-1265.

Contiguous with Serra da Bocaina National Park. \n Ubatuba Aquarium. \n\n\nBeaches\n\nUbatuba is simply one of the best places in Brazil to practice surf, nautical sports, diving and birdwatching. With 80 beaches, there are beach options for all kinds of audiences \u2013 from the high waves of Itamambuca to the calms waters of L\u00e1zaro. Uninhabited beaches such as Brava, Almada and Cedro draw one\u2019s attention, and the access to them is made through tracks. For those looking for movement, the best option is \u201cGrande\u201d Beach or the schooner rides to Anchieta Island.\n\n Almada. \n Brava. \n Cedro. \n Enseada. \n F\u00e9lix (15 km north of center). Beach with preserved natural surroundings, despite being next to a condominium. It is popular among surfers, although slightly less than Itamambuca. \n Grande (4 km south of center). The most popular beach in town, over 2 km long with a wide sandy area and strong waves that are good for surfing. With younger crowds and many kioks. \n Itagu\u00e1 (at city center). Ubatuba's central beach is not suitable for bathing, but it can be very pleasant place for walking or cycling at morning, or having a snack or a drink during the evening. \n Itamambuca, access via a sidestreet at Km 34 of BR-101 (15km north of downtown). Famous beach that hosts international surfing competitions. Like F\u00e9lix, it is at a condominium complex but has preserved natural surroundings. It is also where the Itamambuca river flows into the sea. The river is not suitable for bathing, but you can make a short boat ride there. \n L\u00e1zaro (15 km south of center). Beach with beautiful surroundings, popular among families due to its calm waters. \n Maranduba. \n Perequ\u00ea. \n Prumirim (18 km north of center).

An urban beach that does not look urban at all, being surrounded by trees instead of roads and buildings. One can walk from there to Praia Grande by a small trail. \n Ubatumirim (28 km north of center). Long, broad and flat beach, perfect for walking, jogging and other sports. One of the few beaches that is easily accessible by car and not inside a suburb or condominium,instead containing some camping facilities. \n Vermelha do Norte (7 km north of center).

The trail is poorly-signposted and hard to follow, however, so it is best to arrange for a guide through the tourist information center (see the Understand section above).\n\n\nBuy\nThere are many tourist-oriented shops on Rua Guarani and in the north part of R. Leovegildo Dias de Oliveira, in front of the Itagu\u00e1 beach. The area becomes quite crowded during evenings on high season and holidays, and contains shops, restaurants, bars and kiosks in the beach front.\nThe \"actual\" commercial center of the city is Av. Thom\u00e1s Galhardo, where you can find more general products and services. The area is being revitalized, to make it a popular spot among local and tourists.\n\n\nEat\nSpecialties in Ubatuba include locally-harvested mussels and peixe azul marinho, blue marine fish served and pir\u00e3o de banana verda, a dish made with manioc flour and green bananas.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Restaurante Casa do Marmitex, R.

There is no place to be really avoided during the day, at least not a place that a visitor has reason to go. Walking during the night is generally fine, but consider driving or taking a cab if the place where you want to go is more than a few blocks away. During high season and holidays, R. Guarani and R. Leogevildo Dias de Oliveiro are pretty safe during the evening, since there will be many people there.\n\n\nStay healthy\nAs you may expect from a rainforest area, mosquitos will be a serious nuisance in most places. Using a good repellent in all but the most urban beaches is advised.\nAs elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Ubatuba are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of the latest weekly beach quality bulletin (in Portuguese, boletim de qualidade das praias) of the state's Environment Department (CETESB).\n\n\nGo next\nYou find hostels and private rooms ...:\n\n\nin the (south-)west:\nCaraguatatuba \u2013 50 km.
