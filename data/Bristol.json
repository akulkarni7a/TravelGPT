  "extract": "Bristol is a city in the West Country of England. Famous for its maritime history it also offers a great and diverse range of attractions, hotels, bars and events. Bristol is one of England's top visitor destinations, and the best time to visit is in the summer when major festivals are held in the city.\nAlthough cursed by some horrible post-war buildings, Bristol is nevertheless an amiable, grooved, laid-back city whose mellow vibe is reflected in the music of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky that perfectly captures the sultry, lean burn atmosphere of a warm summer's evening in this historic and cultured city.\n\n\nUnderstand\nBristol is the United Kingdom's 8th most populous city (approximately 483,000 as of mid-2023) and the most populated city in South West England, making it a core city in England. It received a Royal Charter in 1155 and was granted county status in 1373. From the 13th century, for half a millennium, it ranked among the top four English cities (after London and alongside York and Norwich) until the rapid rise of Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester during the Industrial Revolution in the latter part of the 18th century. Bristol borders the counties of Somerset and Gloucestershire and is near the historic cities of Bath to the southeast, Gloucester to the north and Cardiff, the capital city of Wales, to the northwest. The city was built around the River Avon, and has a short coastline on the estuary of the River Severn where it flows into the Bristol Channel.\n\nAlthough often overlooked as a tourist destination, Bristol has a lot to offer of its own and is an excellent base for exploring the West Country, with relatively inexpensive accommodation compared to some of the main \u2018tourist traps\u2019 and a huge choice of bars, restaurants and shops. It is one of the most culturally vibrant cities in England, hosting a wide variety of visual arts, theatre, speciality shopping and live music.\n\nYoung people have flocked to Bristol thanks to the city's stunning and brilliant music scene - the likes of Massive Attack, Portishead, Tricky and Roni Size have contributed some of the most outstanding back catalogue of albums in the history of British music - not bad for a city which even in the early 1980s was considered a backwater of the British music scene. Indeed, in 2010 it was voted Britain's most musical city. The success of the Bristol music scene began in 1991 when Massive Attack released their magnificent opus Blue Lines which included \"Unfinished Sympathy\" and social critiques such as \"Safe From Harm\" and \"Daydreaming\". Blue Lines was partly recorded at the Coach House studios in Clifton (now defunct). The album, and particularly the track \"Lately,\" captured the atmosphere and vibe of the city. This track, with vocals by Shara Nelson, so perfectly captured the atmosphere of a summer's evening in Bristol \u2014 particularly on the Clifton Downs \u2014 that with its warm, laid-back vibe it is practically a signature song for the city.  \n\n\nOrientation\nBristol is a large city with various areas in its centre; a map is helpful to get to know the layout. The free map given away at the Tourist Information Centre at the Harbourside is excellent for this. At Bristol's core is the Floating Harbour - a stretch of water that snakes along the city centre which looks like a river in places but which is actually a dock. For centuries the Floating Harbour was where ships docked, bringing trade and prosperity to the city. It was created by diverting the River Avon in the early 19th century to the New Cut to the south, and by using various locks to create a non-tidal dock. Today, the industrial shipping has mostly gone and the Floating Harbour is a home for leisure, pleasure craft, upmarket waterfront apartments, and the occasional visiting sailing ship.\nIt's easiest to think about city locations as where they are relative to The Centre, or Central Promenade. (It's called \"The Centre\" as it used to be the \"Trams Centre\", until Bristol's tram system was scrapped in the 1940s after bomb damage. Now it's more of a bus centre.) The Centre is a broad avenue running north-south with fountains and trees and shops, and traffic, reaching the Floating Harbour at its southern end. The Centre is a major interchange for most city bus routes - you can ask a bus driver for a ticket to \"The Centre\" from anywhere in the city and you'll get back there.\nTo the east of The Centre is the core of historic Bristol - the Old City. Here major streets include Queen Square, King Street, Baldwin Street, and Corn Street. It has wonderful Victorian and Georgian buildings, historic and charming pubs, and many places to shop, drink and eat. To the north-east of the Old City is Bristol's main shopping area - Broadmead, centred on the Broadmead itself and related streets such as the Horsefair, Union Street and Penn Street as well as The Galleries shopping centre. At the east end of the Broadmead is the major shopping centre at Cabot Circus and a related development of more boutique shops at Quakers Friars. If you go east of Cabot Circus and across the dual carriageway you get to the less affluent area of Old Market, while if you go north of it you get to the St. Paul's area, which is a hotbed of culture but is best visited during the day.\nTo the north of The Centre are areas occupied by the city's hospitals, the bus station at Marlborough Street, and the University of Bristol.\nTo the west of The Centre is the Harbourside area, much of which has been a scene of heavy urban regeneration since 2000 and includes parts of what used to be called Canon's Reach. Here you'll find eateries in converted warehouses, Millennium Square with its attractions such as At-Bristol, and offices and smart apartments in new developments. It's a great place to spend time by the water. It continues to the south of the Floating Harbour at the M Shed museum of Bristol life, along to the SS Great Britain.\nTo the north-west of The Centre, and up Park Street, you head for the West End with its smart independent shops, the City Museum and other attractions, and if you keep going along Queen's Road you get to the upmarket Clifton area, known for its suspension bridge and elegant Georgian architecture.\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Bristol website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Bristol Airport (BRS  IATA) (8 mi (13 km) south-west of Bristol city centre). It offers scheduled flights from major European cities. It is a major base for budget airlines Easyjet and Ryanair, with nearly 80 destinations including: Amsterdam also with KLM, Paris, Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, Rome, Prague, Krak\u00f3w, Bratislava, Kaunas and Riga (but not London).   (updated Apr 2023)\nThere is no train link between Bristol's airport and the city, but there is a very useful bus service (bus A1) that takes about 35 min and has a frequency of up to every 10 min. It costs \u00a313 for an adult return ticket (the second part of which can be used up to a month after the first), \u00a38 for a one-way to the city centre, and \u00a325 for a family return. There are student discounts on this service if you have a valid student photo ID. The Flyer bus is useful because route A1 takes you to Temple Meads station, then to the bus station at Marlborough Street.\nThere is a cheaper Falcon service by Stagecoach (\u00a35 return) booked one day in advance via Megabus.com. The Falcon service terminates at Bond Street.\nThere is also a chepaer U2 service by First (\u00a32 single under the England bus fare scheme), the bus station is The Airport Tavern, a 10-15 minute walk from the Terminal. The bus will get you to the city centre but watch out the timetable and the day of service. \nThe last cheper option would be the WESTlink services an 'on demand' bus services (\u00a32 single) that cover the airport terminal and some limited area of south Bristol. It can get you to Parson Street Train station or somewhere closer to Temple Meads station along Bath Road and York Road (10 minute walk to Temple Meads station).\nThe alternative is to use one of the London airports or Birmingham airport and travel on to Bristol by train, car or bus. The most convenient are:\n\nHeathrow Airport (LHR IATA) is about two hours drive straight down the M4 (westbound) motorway. The RailAir express bus service (running every 20 minutes) connects with the main London to Bristol rail service at Reading rail station; expect the total journey to take slightly over two hours. Another possibility is to use the Heathrow Express service to London Paddington and then take a train to Bristol Temple Meads from there, which is more expensive and slightly longer than the route via Reading, but possibly more convenient. There are also direct National Express and Megabus coaches from Heathrow to Bristol, which take about two to two and a half hours (depending on whether they depart from Heathrow Central Bus station or T4/T5) and are often cheaper than a rail fare, especially during (rail) peak times. National Express coaches terminate at Marlborough Street coach station in the city centre whilst Megabus services terminate at Bond Street near McDonald's and Cabot Circus.\nBirmingham Airport (BHX IATA) is within quicker (and cheaper) reach of Bristol than London's two other airports, Gatwick and Stansted. By car it takes about 2 hours and you'll be avoiding the congestion-prone M25. Rail services connect Birmingham International to Bristol every 30 min at peak times with a change in Birmingham New Street. The journey takes 2-2\u00bd hours.\nGatwick Airport (LGW IATA) is about 3 hours drive away via the M23 (northbound), M25 (clockwise) and M4 (westbound) motorways. Gatwick has its own built-in station and you can take a train from Gatwick to Reading where you change to take a train straight to Bristol for a rough total of \u00a350 (although you can get relief by using a railcard and booking in advance). If you're on a budget, it can be cheaper to get the Gatwick Express train to London Victoria and from the nearby Victoria Coach Station take a bus to Bristol. There are also coach services provided by National Express and Megabus that take 3\u00bd hours between the airport and Bristol.\nStansted Airport (STN IATA) is about 3 hours drive away via the M11 (southbound), M25 (anti-clockwise) and M4 (westbound) motorways. By train you must catch a Stansted Express train to London Liverpool Street station, the tube to London Paddington station, then follow the directions below; expect the total journey to take around 3\u00bd hours. If you're travelling on a budget you can also take Route Express Bus A51 to from Liverpool Street Station to Stansted Airport. Costs \u00a39 for a single, and only takes about 10 minutes longer than the train.\nCardiff Airport (CWL IATA) is about one hour west of Bristol, going northbound from Culverhouse Cross, to J33 of the M4, then Eastbound, to Bristol. Or take the train direct from Cardiff Airport, to Cardiff Central Station, then take another train to Bristol Temple Meads Station.\nWhen coming from London, the cheapest way is generally by coach or rail.\n\n\nBy train\n\nSee also: Rail travel in Great Britain\n2 Bristol Temple Meads station (about 15 minutes walk from the city centre). Has regular inter-city and regional train services from Bath, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, London Paddington, Manchester Piccadilly, Plymouth, Southampton, Swansea, York, and many other UK towns and cities. Great Western Railway and CrossCountry provide all train services. If you have luggage or are too tired to walk, and need to get to the city centre or Clifton, take bus no. 8 from the bus stops at the station forecourt, or a taxi.   (updated Aug 2022)\n3 Bristol Parkway station. The second main railway station which is several miles north of the city centre deep in suburbs. Although this station also has frequent services to many of the same locations as Temple Meads, it is principally aimed at suburban residents and is unlikely to be useful to visitors.   (updated Aug 2022)\nFrom London, you travel from Paddington station. There are several through trains an hour, the fastest of which takes 1 hr 13 min to Bristol Parkway and 1 hr 32 min to Bristol Temple Meads. Train times (from any location) can be found on the National Rail Planner or by calling \u260f +44 845 748 4950 from anywhere in the UK.\n\n\nBy bus\nNational Express operate services to Marlborough St Coach station in the city centre, from cities throughout the UK including London. The journey from London to Bristol takes about 2 hr 30 min. Tickets are much cheaper if booked in advance online (London to Bristol \u00a33.50).\nMegaBus also operate budget coach services from London Victoria coach station and cities thoughout the UK to a stop outside Black's Bond St. Tickets must be booked online and fares are demand responsive but can be cheap (\u00a33.50). The journey from London to Bristol takes about 2 hr 30 min. \nFlixbus also operate budget coach services from London Victoria coach station and cities thoughout the UK to a stop outside Black's Bond St. Tickets must be booked online and fares are demand responsive but can be very cheap (\u00a32.00). The journey from London to Bristol takes about 2 hr 50 min. \nSouth West Falcon operates a service connecting Bristol, Taunton, Exeter, and Plymouth. A single fare from Plymouth to Bristol is \u00a327. Tickets can be booked online in advance and is cheaper, but reservations are not strictly required.\n\n\nBy bike\nThe Bristol-Bath Railway Path is part of the National Cycle Network (R4) and provides a cycle corridor between the city centres of Bristol and Bath. Travel time is about 90 minutes. The path is relatively flat, and has only 2 road crossings, making it very safe. In the morning and evening it is a busy commute route, so it may be advisable to avoid these peak hours.\n\n\nBy car\nThe M5 and M4 motorways intersect near Bristol and the M32, a motorway 'spur', brings traffic directly into the city centre. The M4 links London with Bristol with a driving time of less than 2 hours.\nThe city also has several Park and Ride facilities, Portway, Brislington, Lyde Green, Parkway North, Yate, and Long Ashton sites, for more information see the Bristol City Council website.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nMaps\nVisit Bristol, the official tourism website for Bristol has maps of the city to download. Distinctive blue A3 tourist maps which cover the city centre, the Harbourside and Clifton, are available for free from locations such as libraries, shops, Temple Meads railway station, hotels and the YHA hostel. These really are excellent maps and you should obtain a copy or two. They indicate main streets, attractions, hotels and areas of the city in the central area and in Clifton.\nYou can also buy commercially produced maps before you leave from sites such as Amazon. The pocket-sized \"Bristol Pop-Out Map\" is useful, as are the pocket-sized A-Z maps.\nBristol is also home to a branch of Stanfords, a very large supplier of maps and tour guides (e.g. their store at Covent Garden in London is the largest such store in the world). Maps of Bristol with all the city centre street names and destinations marked sell from \u00a31.50. Stanfords can be found at 29 Corn Street, and the staff double as local travel experts.\n\n\nBy foot\nMost locations in central Bristol (the Harbourside and Old City areas) are reasonably easily walkable, and there are plenty of attractive walking routes along the quaysides and in the pedestrianised central streets. The main rail station (Bristol Temple Meads) is a little further (about 15 min walk) but still accessible by harbourside walkways or by bus.\n\n\nBy e-scooter\nThe city has an e-scooter hire scheme operated by Dott. To use a Dott e-scooter, a smartphone with mobile phone number and internet access is needed, and riders must be at least 18 years old and hold a provisional or full drivers licence. This will need to be confined in the app.\nScooters are parked in \u2018virtual bays\u2019 across the city. The unlock fee is \u00a30.99 and the cost per minute is \u00a30.16. Daily passes are available. You must park your scooter in the designated areas which can be found on the app, otherwise you\u2019ll continue to be charged by the minute. It\u2019s not uncommon for parking bays to be full, so be prepared to travel further than planned. \n\n\nBy bicycle\nBristol has plenty of bike paths and routes and is at the centre of the National Cycle Network. Sustrans, which manages the network, is based in the city, and has a shop and information centre on College Green, next to the Marriott Hotel. The staff can provide information on cycle routes throughout the UK. Free cycling maps for the Avon Cycleway, Bristol and surrounding council regions (South Gloucestershire, North Somerset, Bath and North-East Somerset) can be obtained from the four councils' cycling website, BetterByBike.info.\nDott operate an app based e-bike hire scheme. Bikes are parked in \u2018virtual bays\u2019 across the city. The unlock fee is \u00a30.99 and the cost per minute is \u00a30.16. Daily passes are available. You must park your bike in the designated areas which can be found on the app, otherwise you\u2019ll continue to be charged by the minute. A smartphone with internet connection is required to use it. \nBristol is a very cyclable city, but unless you're limiting your stay to the Floating Harbour and the Avon valley, hills are never far away. A mountain bike is highly recommended over a city bike, even if you don't plan to go off-road. Mountain bikes can also cope easier with the numerous potholes and generally deplorable state of a large part of the Bristolian road network. Litter, most annoyingly broken glass bottles, are a threat to inner tubes so the choice for a mountain bike with thicker tyres will reduce the chance of running flat as well. Especially in the inner city (Park Street, Baldwin Street) glass shards often plague cycle paths and crossings.\nBicycle theft is unfortunately relatively common in Bristol, so if you're hiring a bicycle, check that a decent D-lock or U-lock is included.\nSeveral bicycle rental services are available in the city:\n\n1 Cycle The City, No.1 Harbourside, 1 Canon\u2019s Road, \u260f +44 7873 387167, info@cyclethecity.org. closed Mondays. Bicycle rental service near the waterfront, they provide a bicycle, helmet and lock. ID card required for rental. \u00a316/day.

Rental service for tandems and bicycles, with pick up and drop-off points in around Queen Square, Victoria Park, and Temple Meads. (updated May 2018)\n3 Cycle Shack, 25 Oxford Street, Temple Quay, BS2 0QT, \u260f +44 117 955-1017. Bike repair and rental under the railway passage behind the Temple Meads train station. Bike rental costs \u00a340 for 3 days. \nIf you run flat, almost all bicycle shops in Bristol can fix your tyre for \u00a38-15, although some will do it while you wait.\n\n4 Briscycle, 151 Wick Rd, BS4 4HH, \u260f +44 7716 394633. M 6:30-8PM; Tu Th-F 9:30AM-3PM, 6:30-8PM; F 9:30AM-4PM, 6:30-8PM; Sa 10AM-4PM. Bicycle repair shop in Brislington. Getting a flat tyre fixed will set you back \u00a315. \n5 Halfords, Eastgate Centre, Eastgate Road, BS5 6XX, \u260f +44 117 935-4041. M-F 8AM-8PM, Sa 8AM-6PM, Su 10AM-5PM. One of the largest bicycle shops in Bristol, with many spare parts for self service and repair kits in stock. They also have a repair service while you wait. (updated Dec 2020)\n\n\nBy train\n\n6 Bristol Temple Meads  station offers direct trains to many UK cities including London (Paddington). Local train services include the Severn Beach Line, and stopping services which serve Bedminster, Parson Street and Filton Abbey Wood.\nThe Severn Beach Line passes through Lawrence Hill and Stapleton Road in the East of the inner city, and then, Montpelier, Redland and Clifton Down in the north before heading north-west to Avonmouth and Severn Beach. The line has been voted one of the most scenic in the world by Thomas Cook. The line has two fare zones: Temple Meads to Clifton Down, and Clifton Down to Severn Beach. Trains run M-Sa at approximately 40-minute intervals from 6AM to 10PM, with a reduced Sunday service. Normally only one train in three goes to St Andrews Road (which is a request stop) and Severn Beach, with most terminating at Avonmouth. See council website on train services for more info.\nClifton Down railway station is close to the Clifton shopping district, including Whiteladies Road and Clifton Down Shopping Centre. Beyond here, the line runs in a tunnel under Durdham Down, emerging in the Avon Gorge. You can see one of the tunnel's chimneys on Durdham Down. The station at Sea Mills is next to the River Trym and the remains of a Roman harbour, and is also a good place to start walks. The line later runs through Avonmouth Docks, and beyond that alongside the River Severn Estuary. At Severn Beach, you can walk along the banks of the Severn and see the picturesque suspension bridges - the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossing. All other stations along the line are in primarily residential or industrial areas.\n\n\nBy bus\nCitySightseeing offer open top bus tours with commentary during the summer months. 24-hr and 3-day passes are available. The circular route takes in most of the major visitor destinations including the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol Zoo, City Docks, Temple Meads, old city and city centre.\nMost bus services in Bristol are operated by First Bristol. By and large the buses are unreliable, so if possible check the bus times on the First website as the times on bus stops may be dated and incorrect. As most of Bristol's hotels and places to visit are near the city centre or are in the upmarket suburb of Clifton, First Bristol's number 8 is probably the most useful for visitors. It follows a route from Temple Meads station to Clifton, passing through the main shopping area (Broadmead), the city centre (also handy for the harbourside) and the West End on the way. \nAlmost all single adult tickets are \u00a32.  These can be bought on the bus with cash or card. Alternatively you can buy an \u2018m-ticket\u2019 on the First Bus app. This will give you a QR code that you must scan when you board. Concessionary fares are available for students, young people (16-21) and children. Another option is a day ticket - this may be more economical depending on your plans.\nFirst buses also offer payment via a \u201cTap on, Tap off\u201d system. Simply tap your contactless card (or phone with Apple or Google Pay) on the reader when you board and tap off on the exit reader when you alight. If you take a single trip you\u2019ll be charged the usual \u00a32. More trips will increase the cost, but this is capped at a daily rate of \u00a36. Concessionary fares are unavailable for the \u201cTap on, Tap off\u201d system, as of Dec 2023.\nOther bus operators include Buglers and Abus.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nBecause of the way the city centre is intimately interwoven with the old 'floating harbour', a boat is a good way of getting around and of seeing a lot of interesting  sites. Bristol Ferry Boat runs several ferry services around the harbour, stopping at various quays on route, and providing a commuter service between the city centre and the main rail station. Tickets must be purchased from the skipper directly and cost \u00a32.50.\nThe Bristol Packet offer city docks tours with commentaries daily during school holidays and at weekends throughout the year. They also run regular excursions to riverside tea gardens on the Avon towards Bath and Avon Gorge cruises under the Clifton Suspension Bridge to Avonmouth and back.\nNumber Seven Boat Trips also offer a ferry service during the summer months.\nBristol is quite a hilly city, but if you don't mind walking up hills the walk can be pleasant on a fine day.\n\n\nBy car\nDriving is probably the best way of seeing the surrounding region. A couple of the routes into Bristol during peak hours operate a car pool lane for cars with more than one occupant.\nThe centre of Bristol follows a one way city system, which can be frustrating and confusing for those not used to it. However, with patience and practice and a lot of circling around the same areas numerous times, it does become easier.\n\n\nParking\nThere are plenty of NCP car parks, and street parking. The cheaper street parking is in short supply in the centre, however Queen Square can usually be counted on to have a few spaces at off-peak times.\n\n\nPark and Ride\nThere are three Park and Ride schemes operating in Bristol, with an additional Park and Ride for the busy Christmas period based at the University of the West of England (UWE) in Frenchay. The main park and rides are at Brislington, on the A4 opposite St Brendan's school. Another is in Shirehampton and a third is at the end of the A370 Long Ashton Bypass. These are recommended due to their cheaper fares and ease of access to the busy city centre.\nFor more information, see the Bristol City Council website.\n\n\nBy taxi\nDue to the heavy traffic, taxis in Bristol can be quite expensive \u2013 and don't forget to allow extra time on your journey when taking a cab. There are about 700 licensed taxis (Hackney Carriages) and these can be distinguished as they are all painted a distinctive blue. Meters charged at a rate set by the council. There are a similar number of private hire vehicles (without roof signs) that need to be pre-booked. All legitimate taxis and private hire vehicles should have a predominantly yellow council-issued plate at the front and back of the vehicle. More information on taxis and private hire vehicles and a cab rank map can be found at Taxis and Minicabs in Bristol .\nOther options include apps like Uber, Bolt, and Veezu.\n\n\nSee\n\nBristol is a very diverse city. From the historic Old City and Harbourside to Georgian Clifton, there is something to be found for everyone. Every neighbourhood has its own attractions and sights.\n\n Street Art. Street artist Banksy is from Bristol and some of his works can be seen around the city. \n\n1 Bristol Blue Glass, 357 Bath Road, BS4 3EW (take bus X39 direction Bath and get off at Arnos Court). Glass workshop producing traditional blue glass, a local specialty since the late 18th century. Cobalt oxide and lead oxide are mixed into the molten glass, giving it its characteristic deep blue colour. The glass workshop can be visited on request with a tour along the furnaces. It also includes a shop where glassware can be purchased.   (updated Apr 2019)\n2 Whitchurch Airport (Old Bristol Airport), Hengrove Park. 24/7. Former airport of Bristol, operating from 1930 until 1957. It played an important role during the Second World War as air bridge between the UK and neutral Portugal, and other territories such as Gibraltar. From the early 1950s the airport became too small to accommodate scheduled services, and expansion was limited by surrounding housing estates. It remained in use for some years for short flights to the Channel Islands, Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man, but flying ceased from 1957 onward. It was reopened in 1959 as a racing circuit, but most of the former airport grounds have been redeveloped since. The main runway still exists and can be visited. Free.   (updated May 2019)\n\n3 Aerospace Bristol, Hayes Way, Patchway, BS34 5BZ, \u260f +44 117 931-5315, info@aerospacebristol.org. W-Su 10AM-4PM. Bristol has a rich history in aerospace, starting with the design and production of the first British biplanes in the First World War. In the past century, the Filton aerodrome designed and manufactured numerous aircraft for military and civil applications, guided missile systems, and satellites. The history is told in great detail with replicas, scale models, and about a dozen original aircraft and helicopters, of which a complete Bloodhound missile system and the last Concorde to have ever flown are the crown pieces of the collection. A complete tour takes about 3 hours and features interactive exhibits to keep kids busy as well. They also have a good cafeteria with excellent burgers and crispy fries for \u00a38, which is better than what you'd find in the city centre. \u00a317.   (updated Oct 2020)\n4 Cheese Lane Shot Tower, Passage Street. 24/7. Historic drop tower used for the production of lead shot (the \"hail\" used in shotgun shells) by dropping molten lead through a zinc sieve into a tank of cold water 35 m lower. The original tower was built in 1782, the first of its kind if the world, but was demolished in 1968 as part of a road widening project. Thus, the current tower was constructed in the architectural style of 1969, around 400 m from where the original tower stood. It continued producing lead shot until the late 1980s when lead was phased out for environmental concerns. The tower was scheduled to be demolished because it isn't particularly flattering to the city landscape 50 years after its construction, but as one of the only 3 remaining historic shot towers in England, it was conserved as a Grade II listed building. A new development was built around it in 2005, incorporating it into the redeveloped neighbourhood. The tower's interior isn't accessible to the public. Free.   (updated Nov 2020)\n5 Purdown AA Battery. 24/7. One of the best preserved heavy anti-aircraft defence sites of the Second World War in the UK. The site is on top of a hill overlooking the north-east of Bristol. During the Second World War, anti-aircraft guns including the iconic Bofors were stationed here, aided by search lights to intercept Luftwaffe bombers before they reached the city. Much of it is overgrown, and it has fallen prey to graffiti vandalism. It is part of Stoke Park which  is also worth a visit. Free. (updated Jun 2024)\n\n\nHarbourside\nThe floating harbour is the jewel in Bristol's crown, and many of its attractions are on or close to the harbour:\n\n6 Brunel's SS Great Britain, Great Western Dockyard, Gas Ferry Rd, \u260f +44 117 926-0680, fax: +44 117 925-5788.

A 2.4 ha garden square in the centre, originally laid out outside Bristol's city walls in an area known as the Town Marsh. Its planning started in 1699 and construction finished in 1727, being named after Queen Anne. It has seen a turbulent history, with much of the north and west side buildings being destroyed during the riots of 1831 and subsequently rebuilt. From 1937 to 1992 the square was scarred by a dual carriageway road crossing it diagonally, which created a lot of traffic to flow through the area. After this became unbearable by the 1990s, the road was closed and demolished by the late 1990s, and the garden restored to its pre 1937 glory. Although originally a residential neighbourhood, the buildings surrounding the square are nowadays used as offices, and many are listed under heritage protection.

A large and architecturally impressive shopping centre in central Bristol, opened in 2008.

It is a large, and mostly under-cover shopping centre, containing over 120 shops including Hugo Boss, Berska, Lush, Stradivarius, and Rituals.   (updated Dec 2024)\nBroadmead remains a pretty dire indictment of post war planning and architecture; it contains The Galleries, Bristol's city centre mall. It is large, though the range of shops doesn\u2019t offer much. Primark and TK Maxx are the remaining department stores. The now empty Debenhams store towers over the area. Other high street stores include Lush, Waterstones, and HMV (Updated 2023).\n\n3 The Mall Cribbs Causeway, Kessels Rd, Patchway, BS34 5DG. An out of town mall off junction 17 of the M5.

Nearby on Midland Road is The Club, and on Alfred Street, The Elite Retreat; both good massage parlours, although Central Massage on Old Market Street is the cheapest, and Adam & Eve on West Street is open 24/7.\nBristol also has quite vibrant district shopping centres. The best of these are probably:\n\nChristmas Steps area, mainly independent shops including many boutique type shops, including bookshops, hairdressers, vintage clothing stores and some bars.\nNorth St and East St, in Bedminster in the south of the city. A wide range of independent shops, also supermarkets, greengrocers, butchers, bars, cafes, delicatessens, charity shops.\nGloucester Rd/Cheltenham Rd in the North, which offer a lot of cafes and restaurants, a number of instrument shops, many hardware stores and a good selection of independent butchers, bakers and greengrocers. At night, the restaurants and pubs attract lively nightlife.\nFishponds Rd and Staple Hill in the East. Asian restaurants, thrift shops, bakers and independent stores.\nSt Mark's Rd in Easton, in the east of the inner city, which is particularly noted for its mainly South Asian food shops and restaurants. It is also home to a modern vegetarian/vegan restaurant (Caf\u00e9 Maitreya) that has won national acclaim.\n\n\nMarkets\nThere are also a number of markets in and around the city. St Nicholas Market  in the centre, near Corn St. is a permanent fixture and has stalls selling jewellery, books, CDs and fresh food. It also hosts the 'Nails' market on Fridays and Saturdays, a Flea Market on Fridays, and various special markets around the end of the year. There are a number of farmers markets (and similar events) held at different venues around the city. These include:\n\n Corn St.. Bristol Farmers Market on Wednesday mornings 9:30AM-2:30PM.

Due to its popularity with both stallholders and shoppers it is now fortnightly, alternating Fridays 8:30AM till 1PM, and Saturdays, 9AM till 2PM, at the corner of Whiteladies Road and Apsley Road. \n\n\nEat\nBristol has a huge choice of bars and restaurants to suit all tastes and budgets. There are many around the Harbourside and the West End's Park Street and Whiteladies Road, but do not be dissuaded from trying those outside the centre as many are superior to those that attract passing trade due to their location. After a night out, or if your hotel allows food delivery, you will also be able to find many takeaways in Bristol, with different varieties of food.\n\n\nBudget\n\n\nCity centre\n1 St Nicholas Market, The Corn Exchange, Corn St. There is a food aisle within the glass arcade at St Nicholas Market.

(updated Nov 2018)\n\n\nDrink\nThe fact that it's the home to around 44,000 students probably says a lot for the quality of the city's nightlife. Surprisingly, though, it's relatively expensive, with prices similar to those in London. Mainstream nightlife centres around 3 main areas - Corn Street in the 'old city', Park Street/Whiteladies Road, and the Harbourside. These areas get extremely busy, if not rowdy, at weekends, however there are plenty of places in Bristol where you can have a good time without mixing with more student type crowds. Venue magazine is a good source of information. The eastern end of King Street in the old city provides a slightly more relaxed, but popular, outdoor drinking area on sunny summer evenings, surrounded by historic pubs such as the 17th-century Llandoger Trow (reputed to have been the haunt of pirates and the model for the Admiral Benbow in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel \"Treasure Island\").\nAmongst the hundreds of brilliant venues in the city, there are four outstanding areas:\n\nSt Nicholas' Market, including Baldwin Street: on and around Corn Street, you'll find several chain bars, including Wetherspoons' the Commercial Rooms on Corn Street which was once a meeting place for Merchant Ventures. Other reliable venues include the Slug & Lettuce and Vodka Revolution on St Nicholas Street, All Bar One and Walkabout on Corn Street and O'Neill's and Reflex on Baldwin Street. However, those looking to get away from the familiar will definitely enjoy Start The Bus at the bottom of Corn Street, an established indie pub-come-club; also, Mr Wolf's on St Stephen's Street offers noodles and live music.\nHarbourside area: the regenerated waterside is a great place to drink, especially on summer afternoons. On Welsh Back, there's the famous Old Duke jazz pub and, opposite it, the famous Lladngoer Trow - plus, the Apple, a floating cider bar. Bristol's famous bar on a boat, the Thekla, is around the corner, and there are plenty of big chain and independent bars on Canon Road. Millennium Square has lots of chain restaurants and bars centred on the impressive mirrored 'Imaginarium' and fountains. The Waterfront by the hippodrome can be rowdy of a weekend and is best avoided.\nPark Street, Park Row, Clifton Triangle and Whiteladies Road: Whiteladies Road runs from the Downs on top of Blackboy Hill, past Clifton on one side and Cotham and Redland on the other; at the Triangle, traffic runs around the eponymous island of shops and bars before pushing down Park Street to the centre of Bristol. There are hundreds of bars and clubs along this busy thoroughfare: popular venues include the Tube, the Woods, Embargo, Brown's, The Jersey Lily and the Black Bear.\nStokes Croft and Gloucester Road: the anarchic area of Stokes Croft is home to Bristol's big independent clubs, Blue Mountain, Lakota and Clockwork. Whilst not in Stokes Croft, Club Motion, hidden behind Temple Meads station is a relatively new addition to the Bristol scene, hosting similar nights and acts as these venues. A skate park by day, this huge (by any standards) club has become one of Bristol's most popular, is internationally known, and is well worth a visit for seasoned clubbers; after these monoliths, there are live music venues, pubs and bars to please the alternative crowd. Highlights include the Pipe and Slippers, the Croft, the Bell, the Flyer and the Prince of Wales.\nIf you're a tourist in Bristol, you may enjoy visiting one of the city's pubs and bars with historic and literary connections.\n\nAbolitionist the Reverend Thomas Clarkson stayed in the Seven Stars in Redcliffe while he researched the British slave trade in 1787.\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey used to meet in the Rummer Tavern to talk about emigrating. An earlier pub on the same premises, known as the Greene Lattis, was the first pub in Bristol to get a license, back in 1241.\nActor Cary Grant often stayed in the Avon Gorge Hotel, which has a terrace bar opening out onto Clifton's best view of Brunel's suspension bridge.\nPioneers of the Bristol sound, Massive Attack, established the Tube, a bar/club at the foot of Park Street.\n\n\nCity Centre pubs\n1 The Hatchet, 27 Frogmore Street, BS1 5NA, \u260f +44 117 929-4118. Bristol's oldest pub is favourite of many various 'alternative' sub-cultures and is sometimes the venue for related club- and live-music events in upper room. Due to its proximity to the Bristol Academy venue, it's convenient for pre-gig drinks. Open until 2AM on weekends.   (updated Sep 2017)\n2 Goldbrick House, 69 Park Street, BS1 5PB, \u260f +44 117 945-1950. The bar is laid out over the top floor of a traditional Georgian building and spans four interconnecting rooms. It has a great intimate vibe as it creates the feeling that you are drinking, not in a bar but in someone\u2019s house. The d\u00e9cor reflects this mood as there are contemporary yet comfy armchairs and sofas dotted around. \n3 The Apple, Welsh Back, BS1 4SB, \u260f +44 117 925-3500. A floating cider bar. A converted old Dutch Barge where the decks have been transformed into seating areas where you can sit and lull with the water whilst enjoying some of the West Country\u2019s finest ciders. A really unique place to grab a drink. Just be wary of what cider you are drinking as some are rather lethal and could lead to a man-overboard situation. \n\n\nStokes Croft and Gloucester Road pubs\n4 The Hillgrove Porter Stores (The Hillgrove), 53 Hillgrove Street North, BS2 8LT, \u260f +44 117 924-8234.

Winner of the CAMRA Bristol pub of the year in 2003, the Highbury Vaults is a classic traditional pub with 8 real ales available on cask. Popular with students and older customers alike, and with a large heated garden. Open until midnight. \n9 Cosies, 34 Portland Square, \u260f +44 117 942-4110. Don\u2019t let the location (St. Pauls) of this amazing place put you off. The best way to describe it, is an underground cave. You walk down some steps on the street and enter through one small door straight up to the bar. The first half of the bar is relatively open, by this there are a few windows, but as you turn the corner you enter the \u2018cave\u2019 . A low ceiling, arched brick room with a DJ booth in the corner. On weekends it gets rammed as the beer is cheap, the music is pumping and the wide range of people from the students and middle aged couples to the Rastas in the corner, are all bumping and grinding with one another, leading to one hell of a night.   \n\n\nClifton pubs\n10 The Portcullis, 3 Wellington Terrace, Sion Hill, Clifton, BS8 4LE, \u260f +44 117 908-5536.

(updated Jul 2020)\n\n\nStay safe\nLike many other big cities in the UK, Bristol has its rough areas. Use common sense while getting around. While some of the following information may sound a little scary, many locals insist that Bristol is a lovely and safe city.\nIn the 2020s problems with drunken violence have become worse.\nDrunken brawls can occur in the centre of town on Friday and Saturday nights as pubs and clubs close, especially near the waterfront area, the Centre, taxi queues and fast food joints. This has been reduced somewhat by a heavy police presence and security guards monitoring the taxi queues.\nAvoid Baldwin Street at the 11PM and 2AM kickout times. Go somewhere else to hail a cab from some of the smaller, less busy ranks.\nThere are also specific areas that have a reputation after dark. The inner city districts of St Pauls and Easton are said to be rife with drugs and gangs but should not pose any danger to people outside the narcotics trade. The main areas of these districts are well monitored by CCTV. Pay attention to what is around you, and you should encounter no difficulties.\nAlso, some outlying suburbs such as Southmead, Knowle West and Hartcliffe have a bad reputation, but it is unlikely that a visitor to the city would travel to these parts.\nUnfortunately there are more often than not individuals or groups of lowlifes who come out to look for someone to beat up. The best advice if you want to avoid any trouble is take a taxi back to your hotel, especially if your hotel is further out and you are coming home after 10PM.\nAnother problem is beggars as many will approach you on the street to ask for money.\nAlso, you may find people offering to sell you drugs. Those people have no drugs and will instead give you a bogus parcel (such as balls of cellophane or matches wrapped in newspaper) and run off with your money. They often have knives so avoid the people in the first place.\nIn the 2020s, knifepoint robberies have been on the rise. People have even been mugged for their bicycles at knifepoint in broad daylight. However, these such incidents usually occur in isolated areas of the city, and are unlikely to happen in any area the average tourist would visit. The best way to avoid such trouble is to stick to populated areas.\nBe careful on matchdays especially when the Bristol derby (Bristol City and Bristol Rovers) are playing. Unfortunately fights are very common between the two teams. If you are extremely concerned about your safety, stay away from the stadium they are playing, don't go to pubs or at best, stay out of the city. Don't wear a City shirt in North Bristol and don't wear a Rovers shirt in the southern suburbs and the city. At least, you will get dirty looks. Unfortunately at worst you might get involved in a fight sometimes resulting being severely beaten up for wearing the wrong kit in the wrong place.\n\n\nStay healthy\n NHS Direct, \u260f 0845 46 47 (non-geographic number). \nBristol Royal Infirmary Queens Building, Marlborough Street provides treatment for minor illnesses and injuries, assessment by an experienced NHS nurse, advice on how to stay healthy, and information on out-of-hours GP and dental services, local pharmacy services and other local health services. There is also a NHS Walk-in Centre at Knowle West Health Park, In the southern part of the city, For Opening times contact NHS Direct.\nSouthmead Hospital Emergency Department and Minor Injury Unit open 24 hours every day\nBristol Eye Hospital is a specialist hospital for eye conditions and has an accident and emergency department with limited opening hours for eye conditions only.\nBristol Dental Hospital provides the full range of Dental Specialties including Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Restorative, Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry.Emergency service for dental conditions only (opening hours 8AM-10AM).\nNHS 111 operate a 24-hour helpline available by phone on 111 (free call). For all serious and possibly-serious complaints, they will probably refer the caller to a local General Practitioner or Accident and Emergency department.\n\n\nConnect\nAs of March 2022, Bristol has 5G from all UK carriers. Free wifi is available in many public places.\nThe city libraries all have internet points and may allow brief guest use by non-members.\n\n\nGo next\nMap of places with Wikivoyage articles nearby\n\n\nTowns and cities\nBath, with its famous Regency terraces, Roman remains and spa facilities, is 12 mi (19 km) drive or 15 minutes train journey away, and makes an excellent day trip from Bristol.\nWells, with its beautiful cathedral, is an hour's coach ride from Bristol.\nPortishead, the nearest sea-side resort town with plenty of nature, heritage, and outdoor attractions.\nWeston-super-Mare, resort with a sandy beach and plenty of entertainment suitable for young families. An adult day return from Bristol Temple Meads is \u00a37.50. If possible, taking the train to Weston-super-mare as an adult day return from the bus station will cost upwards of \u00a38.\n\n\nOutdoor activities\nTwo popular rural tourist destinations that are both an hour from Bristol:\n\nThe Cotswolds\nThe Mendips\nFurther afield the following are possible day trips and worthy destinations:\n\nExmoor\nSomerset, Dorset, Devon\nForest of Dean\nBrecon Beacons",
