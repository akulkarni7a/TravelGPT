  "extract": "Welsh (Cymraeg) is a language spoken by 29% of the population, or around 870,000 people, in Wales (Cymru), according to a 2020 population survey. Welsh speakers are found in every part of Wales, but the highest percentages are in communities in the north and west of the country, where 50% or more use the language every day. There is a sizeable Welsh-speaking diaspora in the rest of the UK, but especially in England (Lloegr), along the border and in its larger cities. The language is also spoken by several thousand people in the Chubut province of Argentina (yr Ariannin), as well as by people scattered around the world. All Welsh speakers old enough to attend school in Wales also speak English, while those in Argentina speak Spanish.\nWelsh is a Celtic language closely related to Breton and Cornish, and more distantly to Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic. It has also adopted many loanwords from Latin, French, and English, although the spelling and pronunciation of such words has often been radically altered; for instance, the English verb to smoke and the Latin noun leo (lion) are barely recognisable as ysmygu or llew. The Welsh of Patagonia (Cymraeg y Wladfa) has taken on some loanwords from Spanish not found in British dialects.\n\n\nPronunciation guide\nWelsh is a relatively phonetic language, with most letters having only one pronunciation. Complications may arise with the various consonantal digraphs, particularly \"dd\" which is represented in English as \"th\" as in \"breathe\", while \"th\" is represented in English as \"th\" as in \"think\"; \"ll\" is a famously difficult (and common) sound for non-Welsh speakers to produce - made by positioning the tongue at the top front of the mouth and blowing, and represented here as \"lh\". \"Ch\" is always pronounced like the German name \"Bach\" or the Scottish \"loch\"; the sound which appears in the English word \"church\" is represented by \"ts\".\nThere are relatively minor pronunciation differences between northern and southern Welsh, most notably that \"i\" on the one hand and \"u\" and \"y\" are two distinct sounds on the other in the north, while in the south these letters are pronounced identically as the sound of \"i\". \nUnless overridden by an accent mark, the stress in Welsh words nearly always falls on the last but one syllable of a word. As syllables get added to words, for example to denote a plural or a female person of a particular occupation, the sound of a word can change dramatically.\nWelsh is written in a version of the Latin alphabet containing 29 letters, including 8 digraphs which count as separate letters for collating purposes (and crossword puzzles): a, b, c, ch, d, dd, e, f, ff, g, ng, h, i, j, l, ll, m, n, o, p, ph, r, rh, s, t, th, u, w, y.\nThe letters v, x and z do not exist in normal Welsh usage, but have been adopted from English for limited use e.g. in personal names. \"K\" is regarded as redundant in Welsh as the sound is always represented by \"c\", but it is found in the prefix \"kilo-\", although \"cilo-\" is always acceptable.\n\n\nVowels\nVowels in Welsh can have accent marks, most commonly the circumflex (^), called the to bach (little roof), which lengthens the sound of the vowel, and the acute (\u00b4), which shortens it. Occasionally the diaeresis (\u00a8) appears, dividing two vowel sounds from each other. Vowel sounds tend to resemble those of major continental European languages rather than English.\nThere are seven vowels in Welsh, which have both short and long forms. The following sounds are only approximations in English:\n\na\nlike \"pat\"\n\u00e2\nlike \"father\"\ne\nlike \"pet\"\n\u00ea\nlike \"pear\"\ni\nlike \"pit\"\n\u00ee\nlike \"machine\"\no\nlike \"pot\"\n\u00f4\n\"port\"\nu\nlike \"pit\" (South Wales)\nlike a French \"u\" as in \"tu\" (North Wales)\n\u00fb\nlike \"machine\" (South Wales)\nlonger version of French \"u\" as in \"tu\" (North Wales)\nw\nwhen followed by a consonant or at the end of a word, like \"u\" in \"put\"\nwhen followed by a vowel, like \"w\" in \"well\"\n\u0175\nlike \"oo\" as in \"moon\"\ny\nwhen the only or last vowel in a word, like \"i\" in \"pit\"\nwhen earlier in a word, like \"u\" in \"put\"\nNB: in a few common words, such as fy (my) and dy (your), y is pronounced as in \"put\"\n\u0177\nlike \"machine\"\n\n\nConsonants\nb\nlike \"b\" in \"bed\".\nc\nlike \"c\" in \"cat\".\nch\nlike \"ch\" in German \"Bach\" or Scottish \"loch\".\nd\nlike \"d\" in \"death\".\ndd\nlike \"th\" in \"the\".\nf\nlike \"v\" in \"van\".\nff\nlike \"f\" in \"fun\".\ng\nlike \"g\" in \"garden\".\nng\nlike \"ng\" in \"pong\". Sometimes, like in \"finger\".\nh\nlike \"h\" in \"heart\".\nj\nlike \"j\" in \"jump\"\nl\nlike \"l\" in \"link\".\nll\nplace the tongue at the top of the mouth, and blow.\nm\nlike \"m\" in \"meet\".\nn\nlike \"n\" in \"news\".\np\nlike \"p\" in \"pen\".\nph\nlike \"ph\" in \"philosophy\".\nr\nlike \"r\" in \"red\" (well rolled, as in Scottish pronunciation).\nrh\nan aspirated, breathy \"r\".\ns\nlike \"s\" in \"state\".\nsi + vowel (not a consonant, but a sound)\nlike \"sh\" in \"shore\".\nt\nlike \"t\" in \"time\".\nth\nlike \"th\" in \"think\".\nts + vowel (not a consonant, but a sound)\nlike \"ch\" in \"chocolate\"\n\n\nCommon diphthongs\nOnly southern forms unless otherwise stated.\nEnglish approximations are also given.\n\nae\nlike \"eye\".\nai\nlike \"eye\".\nau\nlike \"aye\", with a rounded closing sound. When used as the plural marker, often pronounced \"ah\" in the north and \"eh\" in the south.\naw\nlike \"ow!\".\nei\nlike \"ey\" in \"hey!\"\neu\nlike \"ey\" in \"hey!\", but with a rounded closing sound.\new\nlike \"eh-oo\" said quickly.\ney\nlike \"ey\" in \"hey!\".\niw\nlike \"you\".\noe\nlike \"oy\" in \"boy\".\noi\nlike \"oy\" in \"boy\".\nou\nlike \"oy\" in \"boy\".\nuw\nlike \"you\".\nwy\nlike \"oo-ee\".\nyw\nlike \"you\" (in monosyllables).\nyw\nlike \"uh-oo\" (in polysyllabics).\nThe differences between some of the diphthongs are often very subtle.\n\n\nGrammar\nGrammatically, Welsh is relatively complex with two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, which all nouns are assigned to, and also masculine and feminine forms of the numbers \"two\" \"three\" and \"four\" which have to match the gender of the object being counted; there are also two separate counting systems, decimal (base 10) and the more traditional vigesimal (base 20). The phenomenon of mutation is a characteristic of the Celtic languages, where the initial letters of words change depending on the grammar of the sentence, which can make tracking words down in a dictionary difficult.\n\n\nPhrase list\n\n\nBasics\nHello.\nHelo.

(CROY-so)\nThere are no exact equivalents of \"yes\" and \"no\" in Welsh; the concept is conveyed grammatically with regard to agreement between the person and tense by indicating agreement or disagreement e.g. \"yes there is\" or \"no there is not\", which is said in different ways depending on how the question was phrased. If the question begins \"Oes...?\" or \"A oes...?\" (\"Is there...?\") then the reply is \"oes\" or \"nac oes\"; if the question begins \"Ydy...?\" (\"Is...?\") then the reply is \"ydy\" or \"nac ydy\" etc\n\nYes.\nIe (ee-yeah)\nNo.\nNa (Nah)\nExcuse me.

Because nos is a feminine noun, it mutates some of the following names of days:\n\nMonday evening / night\nNos Lun (nos leen)\nTuesday evening / night\nNos Fawrth (nos VOW-rth)\nWednesday evening / night\nNos Fercher (nos VER-cher)\nThursday evening / night\nNos Iau (nos IAI)\nFriday evening / night\nNos Wener (nos WEN-er)\nSaturday evening / night\nNos Sadwrn (nos SAD-oorn)\nSunday evening / night\nNos Sul (nos seel)\n\n\nMonths\nJanuary\nIonawr (ION-our)\nFebruary\nChwefror (CHWEV-ror)\nMarch\nMawrth (MOWRTH)\nApril\nEbrill (EB-rilh)\nMay\nMai (MY)\nJune\nMehefin (me-HEV-in)\nJuly\nGorffennaf (gor-FEN-nav)\nAugust\nAwst (OWST)\nSeptember\nMedi (MED-ee)\nOctober\nHydref (HUD-rev)\nNovember\nTachwedd (TACH-weth)\nDecember\nRhagfyr (RAG-vir)\nIt's sometimes necessary to put the word mis (month) in front of the name, as some have other common meanings. For instance, Mawrth means both \"Tuesday\" and \"Mars\", while hydref means \"autumn\".\n\n\nWriting time and date\nDates are written day/month/year. So if you see 04-12-2003, you know that's y pedwerydd o Rhagfyr, not April 12. A date (18-12-1963) fully spelled out is y deunawfed o Ragfyr mil naw chwe tri (you specify the number of thousands, then the individual number of the hundreds, tens, and units; for years from 2000 onwards say \"dwy fil\" (two thousand) followed by the significant number, omitting the zeroes - thus 2005 is \"dwy fil a phump\" (two thousand and five), compared with 1987 which was \"mil naw wyth saith\" ((one) thousand nine eight seven). \nThe ordinals are as follows. The feminine form is given with feminine nouns.\n\n1st - 1af, cyntaf\n2nd - 2il, ail\n3rd - 3ydd, trydydd (m.), trydedd (f.)\n4th - 4ydd, pedwerydd (m.), pedwaredd (f.)\n5th - 5ed, pumed\n6th - 6ed, chweched\n7th - 7fed, seithfed\n8th - 8fed, wythfed\n9th - 9fed, nawfed\n10th - 10fed, degfed\nTimes are either written in the 24 hour clock or with hours and minutes separated by a colon or dot and suffixed by \"y.b.\" (y bore),\"y.p.\" (y p'nawn) or \"y.h.\" (yr hwyr) equivalent to \"a.m.\" and \"p.m.\".\n\n\nSeasons\nspring\ngwanwyn (GWAN-win)\nsummer\nhaf (haav)\nautumn\nhydref (HUD-rev)\nwinter\ngaeaf (GAI-yav)\n\n\nColours\nblack\ndu (dee)\nwhite\ngwyn (m) / gwen (f) (gwin/gwen)\ngrey\nllwyd (lh'oo-id)\nred\ncoch (KO'ch)\nblue\nglas (glaas) - note that this word is also used to describe the colour of grass.\nyellow\nmelyn (MELLIN)\ngreen\ngwyrdd (m) / gwerdd (f) (gwirth/gwer'th)\norange\noren (ORRen)\npink\npinc (pink)\npurple\nporffor or glascoch (POR-for or GLASko'ch)\nbrown\nbrown (brown)\nsilver\narian (AR-yan)\ngold\naur (ire)\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\nBus and train\nHow much is a ticket to _____?\nFaint yw tocyn i _____ ?
