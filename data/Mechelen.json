  "extract": "Mechelen is a historically important city on the river Dyle in the centre of Flanders. It is a vibrant town, mixing trendy and traditional.  Its carillon school is world-renowned, training students from all over the world in the art of playing carillons, sets of 24 or more bells hung in church towers.  Shops downtown are often housed in buildings with the old-style Flemish architecture, but offer edgy fashions sure to appeal to the younger generation.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nIt lies about halfway between Antwerp and Brussels and has approximately 80,000 inhabitants. \nThough now in the shadow of Brussels, Mechelen is a historically important city in its own right.  From 1506 to 1530 it was the capital of the Netherlands under Margaret of Austria.  In 1559 it became an archbishopric, a sign of great importance.  It was famous for its wood carvings, some of which can still be seen in the churches of the city, and for lace and tapestry manufacture.\nMechelen is developing into the centre of non-profit or non-governmental organizations for Flanders. Some famous examples are Natuurpunt, AFS, and the Red Cross.  This is mainly because it's very easily reachable (by train or by highway) but not as expensive as Brussels.\nInhabitants are called \"Maneblussers\" (moon-extinguishers). The story goes that one day long time ago the moonlight was shining on the unfinished St.-Romboutstoren and that some people thought it was burning. The whole city was mobilized to extinguish the fire but there was no fire to extinguish.\nMechelen has its own local encyclopedia, called Mechelen Mapt, written in Dutch with short translations in English.\n\nMechelen city government website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nMechelen is easily reached by train. From Brussels and Antwerp it takes about 25 minutes.\n\n1 Mechelen station, Koning Albertplein 2. The main train station of Mechelen with many connections in all directions, including an hourly direct link to the nearest airport, Brussels Zaventem. (updated Jun 2017)\n2 Mechelen-Nekkerspoel station. Secondary station of Mechelen. This station is slightly closer to the historical centre, so this station may be convenient if you want to start your visit in this part of Mechelen. However, check if your train stops here because most fast trains don't. (updated Jun 2017)\n\n\nBy bus\nYou can also reach by taking a bus from Antwerp. Just outside the main train station you'll find a bus station with connections to many places in the vicinity.\n\n\nBy car\nMechelen lies at the E19-highway.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe city center is about 15 minutes walk from the train station. Mechelen is a very compact city, so you can reach most places on foot. There are a few bus routes through and radiating from the city centre in case you need them.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 St. Rumbold's Cathedral (Sint-Romboutskathedraal), Onder-den-Toren 12. 08:30-17:30.
