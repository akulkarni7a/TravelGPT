  "extract": "Perpignan (Perpiny\u00e0 in Catalan) is the capital of the department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, the Northern Catalonia part of France, and about 15 km from the sea. Perpignan is home to about 120,000 people, and has two rivers flowing through it; with the T\u00eat to the north, and the Basse through the centre. Once the continental capital of the Kingdom of Majorca, Perpignan has been an economical and educational centre for centuries, and this is evident in its architecture.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nPerpignan sits on the crossroads of the French and Spanish, Catalan and Languedocian cultural spheres. It was the \"mainland\" capital of the Kingdom of Mallorca for a while and gained further fame as a connection point between France and Spain when the first high-speed standard gauge rail line between the two countries opened from Figueres in 2010 with the missing section onwards via Girona to Barcelona and thence all of Spain opening in 2013. Perpignan gained some questionable fame in the 2020 municipal elections when a member of the far-right RN and former partner of its leader Marine Le Pen, won the mayoral election, making Perpignan the biggest city with a far-right mayor in France.\nPerpignan is in the heart of the Roussillon plain, about 10-15 km from the beaches of C\u00f4te d'Am\u00e9thyste (Amethyst coast) on the Mediterranean. It sits between the Corbi\u00e8res region and the Alb\u00e8res Massif, foothills of the Pyrenees and the emblematic mountain Pic du Canigou is visible to the southwest. \nThe historical centre has narrow streets with brick houses and one of the highlights here is the quartier Saint-Jacques with the Medieval Jewish quartier. The citadel with the royal palace, the Castillet and ramparts are monuments to the time when the city was the capital of the Kingdom of Mallorca. There's more to the old town than history, it also has many bars and a vibrant nightlife.\nThe outskirts of the city show a sharp contrast to the old town. In the latter half of the 20th century Perpignan grew rapidly, one of the reasons was that people moving from independent Algeria settled here. During this time many suburbs emerged, being built quickly and in a disorderly manner.\nThis article also covers Argel\u00e8s-sur-Mer, one of the major seaside resorts in the south of France (300 days of sunshine per year). That old and lively Catalan village is built around its church and museum.\n\n\nClimate\nThe climate is Mediterranean with hot summers and mild winters, which is evident in the vegetation. Trees include olive trees, palms, green oaks, cork oaks and pines, together with fruit trees (peach, apricot, cherry, almond and orange). In the arid higher locations grows garrigue, thymes and wild lavender.\nRain is relatively rare, though when it falls it's sometimes torrential. Such rains usually occur during late summer or early autumn. Perpignan gets a lot of sun, on average 2506 hours a year - much thanks to the Pyrenees that block rainy weather coming in from the Atlantic.\nWind patterns have names; usually it blows from the northwest, and the wind is called tramontane. The wind from Spain (southwest) is known as alber, from southeast marinada and south migjorn are rarer but these too help clear the sky from clouds.\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe oldest traces of human habitation are from the 7th century BCE, discovered through archaeological diggings around Ch\u00e2teau-Roussillon. Made up of the remains of a home and a grave, it is known as the Ruscino site. In pre-Christian times Perpignan was an important town, first the capital of the Sordones (an Iberic people) and during Roman times a prosperous city with a forum, basilicas, thermal baths and patricians residences. The Roman name for the town was Ruscino, which has evolved into Roussillon. However, the Romans decided to move the regional administration to nearby Elne, meaning the decline of Ruscino. In Elne an episcopal seat was established. \nIn the early 8th century the Muslims marching northwards from Spain returned the regional capital status to Ruscino. The first reference of the city's present name was in a charter from 927, where a place named Villa Perpiniani had been established outside Ruscino. This modest village was chosen as the capital by the counts of Roussillon who had a castle built here in the 11th century. In 1172 it became part of the crown of Aragon, and the city received privileges including a local government with a great degree of autonomy.\nThe 13th and 14th centuries were known as the golden age of Perpignan. Christians reconquered the Balearic Islands, and together with areas in present-day northeastern Spain and south coastal France they were made into a separate kingdom, the Kingdom of Majorca, with Perpignan as its capital. Many of the grand buildings such as the cathedral, royal palace, ramparts and a sea court are from this time. In 1344 the kingdom was reincorporated into the Crown of Aragon.\nRoussillon including Perpignan was annexed by France in 1463, and this was followed by 30 years of local revolt against the French. In 1493 Aragon gained control again and the city became known as Fidelissima Vila de Perpiny\u00e0 - the faithful city of Perpignan. Aragon and later Spain built fortifications around the Perpignan, but in 1642 the French Army returned and in 1659 the region became part of France as part of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. The fortifications were improved again, this time by the famous architect Vauban, and also the city was modernized.\nPerpignan saw warfare again during the Napoleonic Wars. As a city near the border of two European powers, many buildings were converted into military use and many others were destroyed to make the city less cramped. In theh 19th century, Perpignan was industrialized and became an economic center. In the 20th century, the town was under German occupation during WWII and received a large influx of pieds noirs, French North Africans, when Morocco, Tunisia and especially Algeria became independent in the 1960s. The resulting population growth meant that suburbs were created around Perpignan. Perpignan today remains an important economic center in southern France, as well as a popular transport hub for tourists.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Perpignan\u2013Rivesaltes Airport (PGF  IATA), Ave Maurice Bellonte, \u260f +33 468 526070.

In the 11th century the counts of Roussillon established a fortress around the small church of Saint-Jean le Vieux. It's a lively part of the city largely composed of brick buildings with or without coating and small alleys and squares between them. Many streets are pedestrianized and lined by shops and restaurants. \nPlace de la Loge is the most famous square, and was known in the Middle Ages as Pla\u00e7a dels Richs Homens (the square of the rich people in Catalan). It's surrounded by buildings of great importance during the time; Loge de Mer (court and commercial exchange), Palais de la D\u00e9putation, and the city hall. In the middle stands \"La V\u00e9nus au collier\", a statue by painter and sculptor Aristide Maillol (1861-1944). Nearby Place de Verdun sits right next to the Castillet and around the corner is the Basse, surrounded by greenery.\nIn addition to walking around on your own, in the warmer half of the year there are guided walking tours departing from the tourist office, a tourist train going around the historical centre, and a boat with electric motor plying the Basse.\n\n1 Perpignan Cathedral (Basilique-Cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Perpignan), 1 Rue de l'Horloge, \u260f +33 468 513372. Daily 08:00-17:00. Work on this large brick cathedral began in 1324 during the rule of King Sancho I of Majorca. The fall of the kingdom and the Black Death impeded works, and the building was only finished in 1509. It became a cathedral in 1602. It's been modified many times over the centuries and the oldest part is the choir with its seven-sided apse. Attractions include the white marble main altarpiece with scenes from the lives of Jesus and St John the Baptist, and altarpieces of Notre-Dame-de-la-Magrana and Saint-Pierre. There's also a small chapel with sacred art of the early 14th century, and a wooden crucifix brought here from the Rhine Valley.

It's occasionally an event space.  (updated Jan 2024)\n \u00c9glise Saint-Jean le Vieux (chapelle Notre Dame dels Correchs) (north flank of cathedral).

(updated Jan 2024)\n Palais de la D\u00e9putation, 11 Rue de la Loge (next to city hall).

After the French Revolution it was a courthouse until 1866. It's now city government offices.
