  "extract": "Paraty (also spelled Parati)  is a coastal historic town in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was first settled by the Portuguese in 1667. Its old churches, cobbled streets and nearby forests, waterfalls, islands and emerald-green sea attract lots of tourists interested in mixing cultural tourism and more natural settings. The culture and nature of the region are, together with Ilha Grande, listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nParaty grew in the 18th century as a strategically important port for exporting the gold mined in Minas Gerais. When shipments in nearby Rio began to attract the attention and ambition of pirates and privateers from rival European powers, the Crown began using Paraty as their safe port for getting their gold to Lisbon. Together with Ouro Preto, the town was part of the Estrada Real (Caminho Real or Caminho do Ouro, Gold Road), a route used to export gold in colonial times. It was also an obligatory sleep-over stop for travelers between Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo until the late 1800s, when the inner road was opened. This caused Paraty to be forgotten, stalled in time, away from \"progress\" and disfiguration and helped it preserve its old city as it was in the past. In the 1970s, it was rediscovered as a popular tourist destination.\nIt is home to about 37,000 people.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nParaty can be reached by air from Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo only by chartered helicopter or small commercial and private aircraft due to its small airstrip.\nWith a scheduled flight, it's most convenient to arrive in Rio. There are further flight connections to S\u00e3o Paulo. From both cities, you can take an intercity bus or shared ride with Blablacar to Paraty.\nAs of May 2021, there are not yet commercial flights to the nearby airport of Angra dos Reis.\n\n\nBy boat\nAnother possibility of transport is to arrive by sea by way of a sailboat or cruise ship from Rio de Janeiro, Angra dos Reis and Ilha Grande. Fast boat transfers from Safari Transfers from Angra dos Reis are also available.\n\n\nBy car\nParaty is connected by road to Rio de Janeiro (236 km) or S\u00e3o Paulo (330 km), via road BR-101.\n\n\nBy bus\nAir-conditioned buses go back and forth from Rio to Paraty and Paraty to Rio. Buses to and from Rio depart about nine times a day. The trip takes about four hours. The trip to and from S\u00e3o Paulo takes about six hours. From S\u00e3o Paulo try Reunidas Paulista; from Rio de Janeiro, Costa Verde Transportes.\n\n1 Bus Station (Rodovi\u00e1ria de Paraty), Rua Jango P\u00e1dua (500m from historic center). Checkout the timetable for buses in the region around Paraty. \n\n\nGet around\nThe historic town is compact and can be covered on foot; cars, save for taxis picking up or dropping passengers, are not allowed into the historic city center. The rough boulders of the old city streets would quickly destroy the shocks of most cars anyway.\nBuses to the beautiful village and beaches at Trindade (30 km south of Paraty) and outlying beaches leave from the Bus Station.  Buy tickets onboard approximately R$3 to Trindade.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nHistoric Center\n\nSomething of a time capsule, the historic center looks much as it did back in the 1800s. Once a month, at high tide when the moon is full, seawater rises from its normal levels and comes in through special openings in the seawalls that separate the city from the bay, to wash the Historic Center streets \u2014 a marvel of ancient city planning. The streets are only flooded for a short time, until the tide recedes. The water is usually only 15-25 cm (6-10 in) deep and a few merchants near the seawall put out small bridges to span the flooded streets for the benefit of pedestrians.\n\n1 Igreja Matriz (First Church of Our Lady of the Remedies), Matriz Square. Built from 1787 to 1873. Houses a museum of sacred art. Its square can be considered the town center. \n2 Casa da Cultura (Culture House), Rua Dona Geralda, 177 (corner of Dona Geralda and Samuel Costa streets, adjacent to Matriz square), \u260f +55 24 3371-2325.

S\u00e3o Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, s/n\u00ba, Morro do Forte, \u260f +55 24 3371-2289. 18th-century stronghold built with British cannons to defend the gold against British privateers. Built in 1703, reformed in 1822 (when it received the present name, a homage to D. Pedro I) and restored in 1985. It's not actually a fort but a battery, as its walls don't completely encircle its perimeter. Inside there's a museum of popular arts and crafts, a few remaining cannons and very nice views of the bay.  \n\n\nWaterfalls\nAround the waterfall, many trails for shorter or longer hikes can be found, checkout OpenStreetMap.\n\n Iriri, Rio-Santos highway km 158.
