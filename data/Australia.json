With Indigenous cultures that go back over 65,000 years and truly global immigration in modern times, the country is famous for its natural wonders, wide open spaces, beaches, deserts, \"the bush\", and \"the Outback\". However, it is also highly urbanised, with an array of cosmopolitan cities \u2013 the largest and most famous being Sydney, situated on one of the most famous harbours in the world.\n\n\nRegions\nAustralia is composed of six states and nine territories. Visiting all at once would be nearly impossible, as the states in Australia are much much larger than the states in the United States and are more comparable in size to provinces in Canada \u2013 with almost 5,000 km (3,100 mi) separating Brisbane and Shark Bay, the country is vast, about the distance from Madrid to Murmansk, Cairo to Nairobi or Maine to California.\n\n\nIslands\nTasmania is the largest island of Australia and a state in its own right. There are 8,222 islands in Australia, other main islands include:\n\n1 Lord Howe Island \u2014 a showcase for nature two hours flying time from Sydney, administered as part of the state of New South Wales.\n2 Norfolk Island \u2014 halfway to New Zealand, with nature and beaches\n3 Christmas Island \u2014 famous for its red crab migration with flights from Perth.\n4 Cocos (Keeling) Islands \u2014 coral atolls, populated, accessible by flights from Perth.\n5 Torres Strait Islands \u2014 Indigenous culture between Cape York and Papua New Guinea, and requires permission from the traditional owners to visit. Flights from Cairns.\n6 Kangaroo Island \u2014 the third-largest island in Australia containing wildlife, natural scenery, wineries and beaches.\n7 Rottnest Island \u2014 a nature reserve with 63 beaches and 20 bays, located near Perth and home to the infamous Quokka\n8 King Island \u2014 in the Bass Straight above Tasmania.\n9 Whitsunday Islands \u2014 a famous tourist destination renowned for its white beaches\nThere are many uninhabited islands including the Coral Sea Islands, some islands of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Ashmore and Cartier Islands as well as the remote Antarctic islands of Heard Island and McDonald Islands and Macquarie Island.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Canberra \u2014 the relatively small, purpose-built national capital of Australia is home to plenty of museums\n2 Adelaide \u2014 the \"City of Churches\", the relaxed South Australian capital is close to world-renowned wineries\n3 Brisbane \u2014 capital of sun-drenched Queensland and gateway to beautiful sandy beaches\n4 Cairns \u2014 gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, Port Douglas, Daintree National Park, and many beautiful beaches and resorts; a great place for people to get away and relax\n5 Darwin \u2014 Australia's tropical northern capital, at the top end of the Northern Territory\n6 Hobart \u2014 picturesque and quiet capital of Tasmania, the site of the second convict settlement in Australia\n7 Melbourne \u2014 Australia's capital of coffee, culture, and sport, and often considered the country's most European city, known for its vibrant arts scene, world-class dining, and rich sporting culture.\n8 Perth \u2014 the most remote continental city on Earth, on the south-western edge of Western Australia\n9 Sydney \u2014 Australia's oldest city, home to the Opera House and famous for its picturesque harbour, natural beauty and countless beaches\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Blue Mountains National Park \u2014 a mountainous national park in New South Wales, including the \"Three Sisters\" natural feature\n2 Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park \u2014 most popular national park in Tasmania, home Australia's deepest lake and one of its most scenic mountains\n3 Daintree Rainforest \u2014 the world's oldest living rainforest and a well preserved tropical rainforest, home to the largest groups of cassowaries.\n4 Great Barrier Reef \u2014 see first hand this natural wonder, off the coast of Queensland and the world's largest coral reef system\n5 Great Ocean Road \u2014 a spectacular coastal drive in Victoria past many scenic icons including the \"Twelve Apostles\" rocks standing in the ocean and the world's largest war memorial\n6 Kakadu National Park \u2014 tropical adventure travel, Aboriginal culture and nature activities in the Northern Territory. Second largest national park in Australia about the size of Wales\n7 Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park \u2013 South Australia's most iconic national park contains a naturally formed amphitheatre and many fossils dating back from the Ediacaran era\n8 Purnululu National Park \u2013 includes the Bungle Bungle Range, a spectacularly incised landscape of sculptured rocks rising over 250 metres high\n9 Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park \u2014 Ulu\u1e5fu (also known as Ayers Rock) and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) are iconic rock formations in the \"Red Centre\" in the middle of the Australian outback\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe sixth largest country in the world by area, Australia has a relatively small (but growing) population of 25 million. A G20 member, it has high quality of life and is constantly ranked among the world's most livable countries. It is a significant player in the economic and political spheres of the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Indigenous Australian culture, British Empire, Australian Convict Sites\nAboriginal people have been living in Australia for at least 65,000 years. They arrived in successive waves from South and Southeast Asia. With rising sea levels after the last Ice Age, Australia became largely isolated from the rest of the world and the Aboriginal groups developed a variety of cultures, based on a close spiritual relationship with the land and nature, and extended kinship. For thousands of years Australian Aboriginal people maintained a hunter-gatherer culture, or (in some areas) a semi-sedentary culture, in association with a complex artistic and cultural life, including a very rich tradition of story and song.\nThe modern impression of Australian Aboriginal people is largely built around an image of the \"desert people\" who have adapted to some of the harshest conditions on the planet (equivalent to the bushmen of the Kalahari), but many others lived in forested and well-watered regions. Australia provided a comfortable living for the bulk of the Aboriginal people among the bountiful flora and fauna on the Australian coast \u2013 until the arrival of Europeans.\nAlthough a lucrative Chinese market for shells and b\u00eache de mer (sea cucumber) had encouraged Indonesian fishermen to visit Northern Australia for centuries, it was unknown to Europeans until the 1600s, when Dutch traders to Asia began to \"bump\" into the northwestern coast. The Makassan contact from Sulawesi also brought many Indonesian cultural elements to the Indigenous people living in Northern Australia, making Islam the first foreign religion brought in \u2013 and quite a few rock artworks seen in Arnhem Land and the Kimberley depict many Islamic elements.\nEarly Dutch impressions of this extremely harsh, dry country were unfavourable, and Australia remained for them somewhat of a marker sign pointing north to the much richer (and more lucrative) East Indies (modern day Indonesia). Deliberate exploration of the Australian coast was then largely taken over by the French and the British. Consequently, place names of bays, headlands and rivers around the coastline reflect a range of Dutch, French, or English names, however many place names are also from Aboriginal languages with places that were previously having Dutch, French, or English names renamed to Indigenous names, or dual named.\nIn 1770, the expedition of the Endeavour under the command of Captain James Cook navigated and charted the east coast of Australia, making first landfall at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770. Cook continued northwards, and before going ashore on Possession Island in the Torres Strait off Cape York on 22 August 1770. Here he formally claimed the eastern coastline he had explored for the British Crown, naming it New South Wales. Given that Cook's so-called discoveries would lead to the first European settlement of Australia, he is often popularly conceived as its European discoverer, although he had been preceded by more than 160 years by the Dutch.\n\nFollowing the exploration period, the first British settlement in Australia was founded in 1788 at what is today Sydney, led by Captain Arthur Philip who became the first governor of the colony of New South Wales. The process of colonisation led to conflict with indigenous Australians as well as diseases to which they had no immunity. Their populations declined throughout much (though not all) of the land, and they were displaced by British settlers. Originally comprising the eastern two-thirds of the continent, the colony of New South Wales was later split into several separate colonies. Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) became a separate colony in 1825, which was followed by South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851 and Queensland in 1859. The western third of the continent was not settled by Europeans until the British established a naval base in Albany, then known as King George Sound in 1826. The Swan River Colony was formally established in 1829 at what is today Perth. The Swan River Colony was renamed \"Western Australia\" in 1832.\nWhile Australia began its modern history as a British penal colony, the most people who came to Australia after 1788 were free settlers, mainly from Britain and Ireland, and to a less extent other European countries such as France and what is now Germany. Convict settlements were mostly along the east coast, with scattered pockets of convict settlements in Western Australia. The state of South Australia, on the other hand, was settled entirely by free settlers. Many Asian and Eastern European people also came to Australia in the 1850s, during the Gold Rush that started Australia's first resource boom. Although such diverse immigration diminished greatly during the xenophobic years of the White Australia policy, from the Postwar Period Australia welcomed a successive series of immigration from continental Europe, the Mediterranean and later Asia and the rest of the world, becoming a highly diverse and multicultural society by the late 20th century.\nThe system of separate colonies federated to form the self-governing British dominion of Australia in 1901, each colony now becoming a state of Australia, with New Zealand opting out of the federation. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop its agricultural and manufacturing industries and despite its small population it made a notable contribution to the Allied war effort in World War I and World War II in Europe as part of the British Commonwealth forces. Australia was directly attacked in the Pacific War. Australian troops also made a valuable, if sometimes controversial, contribution to the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the wars on Iraq and in Afghanistan around the turn of millennium. Australian Diggers retain a reputation as some of the hardest fighting troops along with a great social spirit.\nAustralia and Britain passed the Australia Act in 1986, ending any remnant power the British parliament may have had to pass laws for Australia. Similar to Canada, the British King remains as the head of state with an (Australian) appointed Governor-General as his representative in Australia.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, there was growth in Aboriginal activism, accompanied by a greater willingness by the general community to acknowledge both the Indigenous cultural heritage (particularly in the visual arts) and the darker side of colonial history. Significant areas of the country have been returned to Indigenous ownership as a result of the land rights movement. In 2008, then-prime minister Kevin Rudd delivered an official apology to the Aboriginal people in Parliament for the atrocities committed against them by the white majority. An Aboriginal ceremony has also been incorporated into Australia's State Opening of Parliament since 2008 as homage to its indigenous heritage.\n\n\nGeography\n\nThe landmass of Australia is both the world's smallest continent and the world's largest island; making up most of Oceania's land area.\nThe nation of Australia includes the Australian mainland, and some smaller islands (such as Tasmania). It is the world's sixth largest country, with a land area of 7,682,300 km2 (2,966,152 square miles). It is comparable in size to the 48 contiguous United States (which has an area of 7,663,941.7 km2) although it has less than one tenth the population, with the distances between cities and towns easy to underestimate. Australia is bordered to the west by the Indian Ocean, to the south by the Southern Ocean, and to the east by the Pacific Ocean. The Tasman Sea lies to the southeast, separating it from New Zealand, while the Coral Sea lies to the northeast. Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Indonesia are Australia's northern neighbours, all much closer than New Zealand, and are separated from Australia by the Arafura Sea and the Timor Sea with Papua New Guinea only being 4 km (2.5 mi) away from Australia.\nAustralia is highly urbanised with most of the population heavily concentrated along the eastern and southeastern coasts. Most of the inland areas of the country are semi-arid. The most populous states are New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, but the largest in terms of area is Western Australia.\nLarge parts of Australia have been deforested to make way for agriculture but many native forest areas survive in extensive national parks and other undeveloped areas. Long term environmental concerns in Australia include water management, salinity, pollution, threats to biodiversity from invasive species, and conserving coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.\n\n\nClimate\nAs a large country, Australia has a wide variety of climates. Most of the country receives more than 3,000 hours of sunshine a year. Generally, the north is hot and tropical, while the south tends to sub-tropical and temperate. Most rainfall is around the coast, and much of the centre is arid and semi-arid. The daytime maximum temperatures in the tropical city of Darwin rarely drop below 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) even in winter, while night temperatures in winter usually hover around 15\u201320\u00b0C (60\u201370\u00b0F). Australian winters tend to be milder than those at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere, and snow never falls in most parts of the country. Temperatures in high-altitude areas of some southern regions can drop below freezing in winter (and sometimes even in the summer) and the Snowy Mountains in the southeast experience metres of winter snow. In the central and western mountainous parts of Tasmania, snowfall is very common.\nAs Australia is in the southern hemisphere, June\u2013August is winter while December\u2013February is summer. The dry season is in winter in the tropics and in summer in the south beyond the Great Dividing Range. Rainfall is more evenly distributed throughout the year in the southern parts of the East Coast.\nIf you are from the Northern Hemisphere, note the implications on cardinal directions: the sun (and stars) move anti-clockwise over here, and it's the northern slopes that get most sun. While this may be confusing any time, during hikes or off-piste activities your intuition may lead you to make critical mistakes. Double check how you are drawing your conclusions.\n\n\nEconomy\nAustralia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per capita GDP on par with other advanced economies.\nThe service industries, including tourism, education, and financial services, account for just over half of the Australian Gross Domestic Product \u2013 about 60%. Within the service sector, tourism is one of the most important industries in Australia, as it provides employment, contributes $73 billion to the economy each year and accounts for at least 11% of total exports.\nPrimary industry - mining and agriculture - has accounted for most of Australia's exports in the 20th and 21st centuries. Iron ore and coal are by far the largest exports, along with wheat, beef and wool. The mining sector is sensitive to global demand for iron ore, with events in the Chinese and Indian economies having direct impacts.\nAustralia has a comprehensive social security system, and the minimum wage is higher than the United States or the United Kingdom. Manual labourers and tradesmen are well-paid in Australia, often more so than white-collar professionals.\n\n\nPolitics\n\nAustralia has a federal system of government, with six state and two territory governments, as well as a national government. It also has several external territories in the surrounding oceans, which are given considerable autonomy, and often not fully integrated with the rest of Australia. Laws vary slightly from state to state, but are for the most part fairly uniform.\nThe national parliament is based on the British Westminster system, with some elements being drawn from the American congressional system. At the federal level it consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives. Each Member of the House of Representatives (colloquially known as a Member of Parliament (MP)) represents an electoral division, with more populous states having more electoral divisions and hence, more MPs. On the other hand, similar to the US Senate, each Australian state has an equal number of senators, with 12 senators being directly elected by the people in each state, and 2 senators each from the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory. The Prime Minister is head of the national government, and is the leader of the political party (or coalition of parties) which has the most Members in the House of Representatives.\nKing Charles III of the United Kingdom is also King of Australia and the head of state, and is represented in Australia at the federal level by the Governor-General. The roles of the King and Governor-General are largely ceremonial, and the Prime Minister wields the most authority in government. A referendum to change Australia to a republic was defeated in 1999, but it failed as the proposal allowed the president to be dismissible by the PM, even though there was general support for a republican Australia. Republicanism in Australia remains a regular conversation point, albeit low on the list of real priorities.\nThe Cabinet of Australia serves as the executive branch, and is headed by the Prime Minister, who appoints his ministers from among the members of both houses of Parliament. The judicial branch is topped by the High Court of Australia, which replaced the UK Privy Council as the highest court of appeal in 1986.\nState and territory governments are organised similarly to the national government with a state parliament serving as the legislature, a Premier (Chief Minister in the territories) serving as the head of the state government, and its own judiciary. There is also a Governor for each state serving as the King's representative in a mostly ceremonial role.\nThe two major political parties in Australia are the Australian Labor Party (ALP or just \"Labor\") and the Liberal Party (Australian slang: The Libs), which operates in coalition with the National Party (referred to as the \"Coalition\"). There are smaller parties such as the Greens and Teal Independents. \nThe centre-left Labor Party spells its name \"Labor\" instead of \"Labour\" because of the American labor movement. The Greens are considered further to the left than Labor and the two parties do not work closely together.\nThe Liberal Party is a centre-right conservative party, with the term \"liberal\" referring to a free market economy. As the word \u2018Liberal\u2019 in Australia is associated with the Liberal Party, \u2018liberalism\u2019 and \u2018liberal politics\u2019 are associated with right leaning politics unlike in other English-speaking countries. They coordinate closely with the National Party, who represent rural electorates and have a more conservative outlook whilst being largely against environmental protections. Since the late 2010s, the Liberal Party has  been challenged by the Teal Independents, a loose grouping of MPs who represent mainly affluent urban areas, and who have been dissatisfied by the increasingly weak environmental position of the Liberals.\n\n\nCulture\nAustralia has a multicultural population practising almost every religion and lifestyle. Over one-quarter of Australians were born outside Australia, and another quarter have at least one foreign-born parent. Virtually every large Australian city and town reflects the immigration from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Pacific that occurred after World War II and continued into the 1970s. In the half century after the war Australia's population boomed from roughly 7 million to just over 20 million people. The cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are culturally very diverse, and home to communities originating from all corners of the globe. Despite this diversity, there exists a strong sense of national identity and pride in the things that are uniquely Australian.\nIn all major cities, you will find a variety of quality of global foods available in many restaurants. Sydney mainly promotes itself as the urban nature capital, Melbourne especially promotes itself as a centre for the arts and culture, while Brisbane promotes itself through various, multicultural urban villages. Adelaide is known for being a centre for festivals, wine culture, and for German cultural influences, while Perth is known for its food and wine culture, pearls, gems and precious metals, and the international fringe arts festival and finally Hobart mainly promotes itself for the convict history. Smaller rural settlements generally still reflect a majority Anglo-Celtic culture often with a small indigenous population. Most rural centres still welcome visitors and generally have a history and local produce to share.\n\nThere are approximately one and a half a million Australians who identify as Aboriginal people who live throughout the country in cities and in rural Aboriginal communities, which is about three percent of the population. Although not particularly obvious to a new visitor, there are many opportunities and cultural activities for people wanting to explore Aboriginal culture.\nContrary to popular mythology, descendants from the original fleets of British convicts are a minority, and even during the years of transportation free settlers outnumbered convict migrants by at least five to one and some places like South Australia officially had zero convicts. Nevertheless, it is seen as a badge of honour for someone to be 'Australian Royalty' in having been descended from a convict, however tenuous that connection may be.\nAustralians can be more socially conservative than some European cultures, but tend to be relaxed in their religious observance. Modes of address are casual and familiar and most Australians will tend to address you by your first name from first contact, and will expect that you do the same to them.\n\n\nHolidays\n\nThe national holidays in Australia are:\n\n1 January: New Year's Day\n26 January: Australia Day, marking the anniversary of the First Fleet's landing in Sydney Cove in 1788.\nEaster weekend (Good Friday through Easter Monday): a four-day long weekend in March or April set according to the Western Christian dates. Very few go to church, but instead many Australians travel on Easter weekend, so expect hotel rooms and airtickets to sell out months in advance.\n25 April: ANZAC Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps), honouring military veterans\nSecond Monday in June: King's birthday holiday (celebrated in Western Australia in September, with WA observing Western Australia Day a week earlier)\n25 December: Christmas Day\n26 December: Boxing Day\nMany states observe Labour Day, but on different days. Most states have one or two additional statewide holidays, with Victoria and South Australia having a day off for a horse race (The Melbourne Cup and The Adelaide Cup). Western Australia has Western Australia Day typically the first Monday in June (recognising the founding of the state since 1829) but also celebrates the Queen's Birthday at a different date to the rest of the country, either at the end of September or early October, due to the usual June date is such close proximity to Western Australia Day. Victoria also has a day off for the AFL grand final Friday.\nWhen a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday (and Tuesday if necessary) are usually declared holidays in lieu, although the celebrations and the retail closures will occur on the day itself. Most tourist attractions are closed Christmas Day and Good Friday. Supermarkets and other stores may open for limited hours on some public holidays and on holidays in lieu but are almost always closed on Christmas Day (25 December), Good Friday, Easter Sunday and ANZAC Day morning.\nAustralia Day remains a national point of controversy and is termed 'invasion day' by many people of indigenous heritage as well as a growing number of progressives, who believe it is insensitive to celebrate the beginning of British invasion and occupation. Calls to change the date are marked by yearly protests. You will see plenty of Australia Day celebrations and barbecues as well, often hosted by local governments.\nOther than official holidays, there are also days of national or regional cultural significance that might as well be holidays such as:\n\nAFL Grand Final: The championship game of the Australian Football League, and the most watched event perennially on the Australia sporting calendar, especially in Victoria. Expects all pubs to be packed full of people watching the game, while many people will hold big watching parties in their homes. Held on the last Saturday of September or first Saturday of October.\nNRL Grand Final: The championship game of the National Rugby League. Particularly popular in Queensland and New South Wales. Usually held on the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October.\n\n\nPeak holiday times\nMost attractions in Australia remain open year-round, some operating at a reduced frequency or shorter hours during the off-peak season. Many attractions (but not all) are closed on Christmas and New Year's Day.\nSummer school holidays start before Christmas and last the whole of January, and it is considered the busiest and most expensive time to visit (unless you're visiting Northern Australia). Holiday homes on beaches are often booked out months in advance as well as charging a significant premium. The long Easter weekend can also be busy as parents take their kids out for a last time before Winter arrives.\nAustralian teenagers celebrate the end of school at the end of November and early December for the 3 weeks known as schoolies. The volume of teen revellers can completely change the nature of some of the cities and towns they choose to visit, especially coastal towns like Byron Bay in New South Wales, the Gold Coast in Queensland, Rottnest Island in Western Australia, Victor Harbor in South Australia and various localities along the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.\n\n\nTime\n\nAustralia can have up to seven different time zones during the daylight savings period, and five at other times. Time zone boundaries do not always follow state boundaries. For instance, the towns of Broken Hill and Silverton, although in New South Wales, follows South Australia time, Lord Howe Island has its own time zone despite being a part of New South Wales and a number of outback communities officially follow NT time.\n\nIn the east, Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria always have the same time. Queensland doesn't observe daylight saving, so it is an hour behind the other eastern states during that period.\nIn the centre, Broken Hill and Silverton (NSW), South Australia and the Northern Territory are half an hour behind during the winter, but the Northern Territory doesn't observe daylight saving while South Australia, Broken Hill and Silverton do. During daylight saving South Australia remains half an hour behind New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, but moves half an hour ahead of Queensland. The Northern Territory remains half an hour behind Queensland at all times of the year, but moves an hour and a half behind New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania during daylight savings.\nIn the west, Western Australia is two hours behind the eastern states in winter, and also doesn't observe daylight saving. It moves three hours behind the eastern states that observe daylight saving (remaining two hours behind Queensland), 2.5 hours behind South Australia, Broken Hill and Silverton while remaining 1.5 hours behind the Northern Territory.\nThere is also the unusual +8:45 time zone, also known as Australian Central West Standard Time (ACWST or CWST) followed in some towns near the South Australian/Western Australian border. While not an official time used, it's the de facto time zone. There are also highway signs telling you to change your clocks, and Apple has a separate region (which can be found under \"Eucla\"). What makes this case even more confusing, is that the only South Australian town in the CWST zone, Border Village, follows daylight savings, follows +9:45, one hour ahead of Eucla, and 45 minutes behind the rest of SA. On the contrary, the chances of being impacted on Border Village is next to zero given that all commercial activity is on the WA side in the town of Eucla which follows UTC+8:45.\nAlthough the chances of a traveller going to the extremely remote Outback WA towns of Blackstone, Irrunytju, Warakurna, Wanarn, Kiwirrkurra, and Tjukurla are very low, whilst all of these towns are in WA, they follow ACST (NT time), 1.5 hours ahead of the rest of WA, and since the NT does not follow DST, these remote towns also don't follow DST.\nThere are no official abbreviations or names for Australian time zones, and you may see a few variations used. EST, CST, WST along with EDT, CDT are sometimes used. Sometimes AEST, etc., with the 'A' prefix distinguishing them from the North American time zones with the same names. \nIn those states which observe daylight saving, it commences on the first Sunday in October and ends on the first Sunday in April.\n\n\nPower\n\nThe mains supply voltage standard is 230 V with a type I plug (angled live/neutral pins with a straight earth). Popularly referred to as a \"two-forty volt socket\". Hotel bathrooms will often have a type C and A socket marked \"for shavers only\" that will down-convert to 110 V for a North American style socket for shavers. Voltage is compatible with Europe and you'll just need a conversion plug that can be obtained from supermarkets and convenience stores (as well as the airport). From North America or other 110 V countries, check your appliance for voltage tolerances before using a conversion plug.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nVisitor information\nTravel Australia website\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: English language varieties\n\nThe English language is universally spoken and understood in Australia. Australian English as generally spoken is distinctive in accent and idiom. It mostly developed from the speech of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, however, the 20th century brought a lot of American influence, giving Australia its own unique variety of English.\nNevertheless, as Australia is a global melting pot, particularly in the major cities, you will encounter cultures and hear languages from all around the world, and you will often find areas and suburbs that predominately reflect the language of their respective immigrant communities. Foreign languages are taught at school, but students rarely progress past the basics.\nAustralia follows mostly British spelling and an eclectic mix of American and British terminology, such as eggplant (not aubergine), boot (not trunk), toll-free (not freephone), take-away (not takeout) and truck (not lorry). American terminology is understood everywhere, while British terminology isn't well understood apart from South Australia and the elderly. In all that, some terminology is uniquely Australian, and is unlikely to be heard anywhere else, except maybe in neighbouring New Zealand.\nA few words also have different meanings in Australia. For example, \"thongs\" in Australia would refer to flip-flops, not underwear.  \"Chips\" can, confusingly, refer to both US \"fries\" and UK \"crisps\"; you can usually work it out from context, or say \"hot chips\" if you mean freshly deep fried potatoes.  \"Fries\" is understood as well though, and is not uncommon particularly for American-style shoestring fries.\nPeople in rural areas may have a broader accent, using some of the slang words that have become outmoded in metropolitan areas, while highly educated urban dwellers sometimes use a cultivated accent similar to that of their British equivalents. Try to resist the temptation to use Australian slang yourself: it's easy to get it wrong and sound patronizing.\nThere is little regional variation in Australian English, although accents tend to be broader outside of the large cities, and the pronunciation of certain words like \"dance\" and \"renaissance\" varies between regions. Most regional differences come down to word usage. For example, swimming clothes are known as cossies or swimmers in New South Wales, togs in Queensland, and bathers elsewhere. Many indigenous communities around Australia and the Torres Strait Islands speak English as a second language.\n\nIt is rare to find signs in a second language, except in urban areas with a high population of Asian immigrants and students, where signs and restaurant menus in Vietnamese and Chinese are a common sight; and also around Cairns and the Gold Coast in Queensland where some signs (but not road signs) are written in Japanese or Chinese, due to the large number of tourists. Some warning signs at beaches are written in several foreign languages.\nVisitors who do not speak basic English will find communicating with Australians difficult, and should do some advance planning. Some tour companies specialise in offering package deals for Australian tours complete with language guides, but mostly in Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, German, Italian, French, Indonesian and Korean. Some tours also give tours in Spanish, Malay and Portuguese, although this isn't as common. Only a very small minority of tours give tours in Hindi, Arabic and Swahili, and finding one of these is once in a blue moon.\nIndigenous languages play an important part in recognising Australia's long Indigenous heritage, but common usage is sadly low, with only 46 left spoken day to day by 42,300 people. You are most likely to encounter these languages in rural outback communities and in the Torres Strait Islands. Although there are initiatives to revive the Indigenous languages, it has proven to be a challenge because of the sheer number of languages that are widely spread out and not mutually intelligible. Learning an Indigenous language will be useful only in specific local areas. Almost all Indigenous Australians speak English as well, although residents of some remote communities may not be fluent in the language. On top of the Indigenous languages spoken, various creole-based languages are spoken such as Australian Kriol or Torres Strait Creole.\nThe standard sign language is Auslan (standing for Australian Sign Language). When a sign interpreter is present for a public event, he or she will use Auslan. Users of British and New Zealand Sign Languages will be able to understand much, though not all, of the language. Auslan and NZSL are largely derived from BSL, and all three languages use the same two-handed manual alphabet. Users of sign languages that have different origins (such as the French Sign Language family, which also includes American and Irish Sign Languages) will not be able to understand Auslan.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nEntry requirements\nEverybody (except New Zealanders)  requires a visa in advance of travel.\nIf you are visiting for a holiday of less than 90 days, there are three types of visas you may apply for, depending on your nationality.\n\nElectronic Travel Authority (ETA) subclass 601 is available to nationals of many countries, and you must apply using the Australian ETA app with a service fee of $20. It is valid for 12 months.\neVisitor (subclass 651) is for citizens of the European Union, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and a few European microstates. These visas are free, but otherwise effectively identical to the ETA. You must apply online.\nVisitor Visa (subclass 600). Citizens of most other countries can make an application online by creating an ImmiAccount; some may need to visit an embassy or visa processing centre as part of the process.\nLike the ETA and eVisitor, a Visitor 600 is by default issued for a three month stay. Unlike the other options however, a 600 visa can be issued for a longer stay of up to one year. For more than a three month stay, you will likely be asked for supporting documentation about the reason for your visit and your ties to your country of origin and may need to attend an interview. Depending on your nationality, the embassy or visa processing centre may also require you to have an Australian sponsor before issuing the visa. The fee is $190. ETAs and eVisitors are valid for multiple entries within a 12-month period. If you're eligible for either, it may be easier to stay the three months you're allowed, go to New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand or some other country reachable by a low cost airline for a few days and come back - restarting the 90-day clock. Doing this more than once, however, may cause immigration authorities to become suspicious, so proceed with caution if you pursue this route.\nThere is a special arrangement for parents of Australians, including Australian permanent residents. The 600 visa can be valid for 18 months, three years, or five years and allow a maximum stay of 12 months during an 18-month period, depending on the circumstances.\nIn most cases, ETAs and eVisitors are approved instantly and the visa will be issued and available for use immediately. If further enquiries are needed you may be asked to return to the application system later to see if you've been approved. Over 90% are processed the same day. In the worst-case scenario your application can be diverted for manual checks that can take months. if you have a complex national history, or any criminal record (including minor offences) you should allow plenty of time for the application.\nIf you are visiting Australia to work, study or for medical treatment, check to make sure you have the right kind of visa, as a tourist visa may not be sufficient. Breaching the conditions or planning to breach the conditions of your visa will result in visa cancellation, deportation, and/or a period of exclusion.\nFor all tourist visa classes you must be able to demonstrate your ability to support yourself financially for the time you intend to spend in Australia and meet character requirements. If you have a criminal conviction, contact an Australian Embassy or visa processing centre before applying or making travel arrangements.\nNew Zealand citizens may travel to Australia without a pre-arranged visa. When they arrive, they will be automatically granted a Special Category New Zealand Citizen visa (subclass 444) if they have no criminal conviction or tuberculosis. This visa allows them to travel, live, work and study in Australia for as long as they like. New Zealand citizens with criminal convictions or tuberculosis may be denied this visa and should seek advice from an Australian diplomatic mission before travel. Non-citizen permanent residents of New Zealand are not eligible for this visa and should apply for a visa based on the passport they hold.\nHolders for a valid APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) except those issued by the United States and Canada may visit for up to 90 days without a visa provided they do not seek employment in Australia.\n\nIf you are transiting through Australia, remain airside for a maximum of 8 hours, have a confirmed onward booking, have the correct entry documentation for the onward destination and are a citizen of New Zealand, the European Union, Andorra, Argentina, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, Nauru, Norway, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, South Africa, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Korea (ROK), Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (regardless of nationality status), the United States, Vanuatu or Vatican City, you do not need to apply for any advance visa. All other passengers who transit through Australia must apply for a free-of-charge Transit Visa (subclass 771) before travel.\nAt all major airports, visitors who are citizens of an ever-growing list of countries (including US, UK and most of the EU) can use SmartGate automated immigration clearance when entering Australia. These are much faster than the manual counters, but being able to use SmartGate does not exempt you from visa requirements.\nAustralia no longer stamps passports or issues visa stickers for most visitors; all visas, entries and exits are recorded electronically. You may request a passport stamp from the immigration officer, though you might have to be directed to a separate counter to get one. You access your visa conditions online through Australian immigration's VEVO web-site or through the myVEVO app if you need proof that you are in the country legally.\n\n\nCustoms and quarantine\nAustralia has strict quarantine requirements regarding importing animal and plant derived products (any food, wooden products, seeds, etc.) You must declare all such material, even if the items are permitted. Baggage is frequently scanned and may be examined by dogs. You may be fined up to $2664 on-the-spot if you accidentally fail to declare, or even prosecuted in serious cases. Declared material will be examined and, depending on the circumstances, may be retained, disposed of, returned to you, or treated by quarantine at your expense. (You may have to pick the item up at a later time.) Processed and sealed chocolates and other confectionery are usually permitted after being declared and examined, as are reasonable quantities of infant formula with an accompanying infant. Different rules apply depending on the origin country of foods, and the state in which you are entering Australia. Check with the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for more details.\nTravellers who are 18 years old or older are allowed to bring up to 2.25 litres of alcoholic beverages and up to 25 cigarettes, 25 grams of other tobacco products (including cigars), 2 vapes (reusable or disposable) and up to 200 mL vape liquid into Australia duty-free. These items may not be imported by anybody under the age of 18, and travellers who exceed their duty free allowance are liable to tax on all goods of that category, not just the amount in excess of the limit.\nSome shells, coral and items made from a protected species are also prohibited to discourage the trade in items that may originate from a threatened ecosystem or species.\nWhile there are no restrictions on the amount of money that can be brought in or out, Australian customs also requires you to declare if you are travelling with $10,000 or more (AUD or its equivalent in foreign currency) and you will be asked to complete some paperwork. Not declaring may expose you to a fine, possible seizure of the cash, or arrest.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nAustralia is a long way from anywhere else in the world, so for most visitors the only practical way of getting into Australia is by air.\nAustralia's major points of entry, in decreasing order of importance, are the airports in Sydney (SYD IATA), Melbourne (MEL IATA), Brisbane (BNE IATA) and Perth (PER IATA). There are also limited international services into Adelaide, Cairns, Darwin and the Gold Coast.\nSydney is a 3-hour flight from Auckland, New Zealand, a 7-11 hour flight from many countries in Asia, a 14-hour flight from the west of the United States and Canada, a 14-hour flight from Johannesburg, a 13-16 hour flight from South America, and up to a 24-hour flight from western Europe (including a stopover). On account of long journey times from some destinations, most travellers from Europe must have a stop-over, commonly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, Doha, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. Since March 2018, Qantas operates a non-stop flight from London Heathrow to Perth taking \"only\" 17 hours \u2014 the first ever regular non-stop route between Europe and Australia. Qantas also has plans to introduce more ambitious non-stop routes from Sydney to London and New York later.\nIf you have to change to a domestic flight in a gateway city, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth all have separate domestic terminals, requiring some time and complexity to transit: check the guides. Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, Cairns and the Gold Coast all have gates in the one terminal building or within easy walking distance of each other.\nAustralia's largest airline is flag carrier Qantas, which together with its low-cost subsidiary Jetstar operate many flights into Australia. Virgin Australia flies several routes from south-east Asia and the Pacific islands into Australia. For those coming from Europe, Singapore Airlines and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific make good alternatives to Qantas, British Airways or the Gulf airlines for flights into Australia. Some routes into Australia are operated by discount airlines such as AirAsia X, AirAsia Indonesia, Scoot and Jetstar Airways. As of 2022, several additional airlines in partnership with Australian carriers have started operating services to Australia. These include Air Canada and United Airlines.\n\n\nPrivate aviation\nPrivate aviation companies such as Australia Jet Charter and JetCorpAustralia offer direct private flights year-round using a variety of aircraft. Popular airports for charter jets include Sydney Bankstown Airport, Gold Coast Airport, and Melbourne Essendon Airport.\nIf you are flying your own personal aircraft to or from Australia, you will need to submit an International Flight Request no less than 72 hours and up to 7 days before departure.  If the airport you plan to land at or depart from is not an international airport, you will also have to apply for approval to use the airport from the National Passenger Processing Committee (NPPC) through their Air and Sea Approval Portal at least 10 business days before your arrival (if travelling to Australia) or departure (if leaving Australia).\n\n\nBy boat\nCruise ships are available mostly in the November to February cruising season, and there are usually about 10 ships that arrive in Australia from other countries during this time. You can cruise to Australia, and then fly home. Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean all offer cruises to Australia across the Pacific.\nYou may sail to Australia in your own yacht, just make sure you submit the right paperwork to Border Force, and arrive at an approved port of entry.\nThere are no international ferry services operating.\n\n\nBy overland transport\nThere was a time when a couple of tour operators offered overland trips from London to Sydney, with only a short hop by air from Southeast Asia to Northwestern Australia while the bus went by barge. The only such tour operator is Madventure which runs 4 different routes: 26 weeks through Iran, Pakistan, and India; 26 weeks through the Caucasus & Central Asia; 64 weeks around Africa, the Middle East, & South Asia; and 64 weeks through Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, & Central Asia.\nFor those determined to travel overland as much as possible from Europe, you can travel independently to Singapore from Europe by train and/or bus on scheduled services, and fly from there to Perth (3,500 flight kilometres). For the truly determined overland traveller, you can get a ferry from Singapore to Indonesia and make your way across to Bali, where you can fly to Darwin (2,000 flight kilometres). For the intrepid, ferries to West Timor, a bus to Dili and a flight to Darwin will mean only 700 km in the air.\nTravel to Darwin by cargo ship/ barge by ANL and Swire (the only two routine cargo haulers between Dili and Darwin) is not permitted (June 2016). For determined travellers, you may be able to obtain passage from Singapore by freighter vessel, organized through a travel agent.\n\n\nGet around\nAustralia is huge but sparsely populated over much of its area and is larger than the contiguous U.S. You can sometimes travel many hours before finding the next trace of civilization, especially once you leave the south-eastern coastal fringe. \n\n\nQuarantine\nThere are restrictions on carrying fruit and vegetables (including honey) between states, and special agricultural quarantine zones within states that have additional restrictions. If you are driving over 100-150 km outside large metropolitan areas or interstate, or flying between states, don't stock up on fruit and vegetables. Check the Australian Interstate Quarantine website for details.\n\n\nBy car\nSee also: Driving in Australia, Australia without a car\n\nAustralia has a generally well-maintained system of roads and highways, and cars are a commonly used method of transport. While public transportation is fairly reliable in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and SE Queensland, having a car is preferable, or in some cases essential, to get around anywhere else. All the mainland state capitals are linked to each other by good undivided highways. Some parts are divided highways but many sections are one lane each way with occasional overtaking lanes around every 5-20 km depending on the state. Roads linking minor centres (or what can look like short-cuts on the map) can be narrow or gravel roads and are generally slower. Australia's low population density and large size makes for long driving times between major centres.\nIn general, unlike Europe, South Africa or the U.S., there are no freeways connecting major centres. Divided dual carriageways that link major centres don't go for very long, and you could get roundabouts or traffic lights at random areas with only 1 km notice. While Sydney to Melbourne can be fully achieved on divided dual carriageways, particularly in the NSW section, there are plenty of flat junctions. Sydney to Brisbane can also be achieved on 99% divided dual carriageways/motorways, with plans to build the remaining one percent as a freeway (expected to be completed by 2027), but the remaining section traverses through the busy centres of Heatherbrae and Coffs Harbour. Other routes like Melbourne to Adelaide are only partial divided freeways (approximately 250 km/750 km \u2013 about a third of the route), but yet there's still towns to be bypassed, and there is only a very short freeway/dual carriageway section in South Australia.\nDrives like Sydney to Perth or Adelaide to Darwin would be much better off achieved by a plane, and journeying here often takes around half a week, and these are routes that Australians themselves only do about once or twice in their lifetime. Distances are huge, and if you put it onto a European perspective: is the distance between Madrid and Moscow, and on a North American perspective, the distance from Miami to Los Angeles.\nMajor hazards on Australian roads are wildlife and large trucks. Be sure to take extra care when driving at dusk or in the dark, as the risk of animal collisions increases significantly. Major regional areas have paved (sealed) dual-lane roads, but isolated areas may have poorly maintained dirt roads or even tracks. Distances and speeds are specified in kilometres and fuel is sold by the litre. There are no tolls on roads or bridges outside of the urban areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Toowoomba.\nAustralia drives on the left. Overseas visitors who are used to driving on the right should take care when they first drive, and again when they are driving on country roads with little traffic.\nGenerally, overseas licenses are valid for driving in Australia for three months after arrival. If the licence is not in English, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is required in addition to your licence. Licensing regulations and road rules vary slightly from state to state.\nThe default speed limit in most of Australia is 50 km/h in built-up areas, and 100 km/h on rural roads, unless signed otherwise except in the NT where urban defaults are 60 km/h, and in WA and the NT, rural defaults are 110 km/h. Many major rural roads have a posted speed limit of 110 km/h especially in the Outback. Average speed is seldom above 80 km/h due to the poor road conditions and limited overtaking opportunities. On some national highways that traverse mountain ranges and travel through small towns, even averaging 60 km/h can be a challenge. Speed limits are strictly enforced in Australia, and even creeping ever so slightly above the speed limit could earn you a ticket with a hefty fine.\nWhile major highways are well serviced, anyone leaving well-maintained roads in inland Australia should take advice from local authorities, check weather and road conditions, and carry sufficient spare fuel, spare parts, spare tyres, matches, food and water. Some remote roads might see one car per month or less.\nCellular coverage is non-existent outside of national highways and towns and you should take some precautions in case of emergency.\nHeat and dehydration at any time of year can kill. If stranded, stay with your vehicle and do what you can to improve your visibility from the air. Do not take this advice lightly; every year locals and tourists die from dehydration after their car breaks down in a remote area. If you do have to abandon your car (say you break down and then get a lift), call the local police station, to avoid a search being started for you.\n\n\nCar rental\nMajor cities around Australia have multiple outlets providing a wide range of rental vehicles from major international rental companies. Major international providers include Enterprise, Alamo, National, Avis, Budget, Hertz, Thrifty, Sixt and Europcar. Most car rental companies prohibit you from taking their cars onto ferries, or across the borders with the Northern Territory and Western Australia, unless you have made special arrangements in advance.\nIn smaller towns car rental can be difficult to find. One-way fees often apply from smaller regional outlets.\nAustralia also hosts many national brands including Redspot, East Coast, Jucy & Nobirds. Smaller cars may be manual (stick-shift), whereas anything larger will mostly be automatic.\n\nIf you do not hold an Australian driving licence, some rental vehicle companies will require you to take a free driver knowledge test, aimed at tourists, that covers the basic road rules, or will take you on a short drive to assess whether you are competent behind the wheel.\n\n\nCampervans\nA campervan is a vehicle, usually a minivan, converted into a motorhome (recreational vehicle), most often catering to the vast number of young European and American backpackers traversing the country. The East Coast from Sydney to Cairns is especially abundant with these vehicles. Driving in Australia has more information on renting or buying a campervan.\nIt is sometimes possible to book a campervan needing relocation from one town to another for a nominal fee of as low as $1 per day. Sometimes, $100 for petrol may be included as well. Websites to search for these deals include Coseats, DriveNow, TransferCar and imoova.\n\n\nBy taxi\nLarger towns and cities have taxi services and can be hailed on the street in most CBDs. Uber and Didi are available in major cities. There are several smartphone taxi booking applications such as myDriver, GoCatch that make finding a licensed taxi simple.\nOutside of cities, towns may have a limited taxi service, with smaller or remote towns sometimes having no service at all.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nDue to the large distances involved, flying is a well-patronised form of travel in Australia. Services along the main business travel corridor (Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane) are run almost like a bus service, with flights leaving every 15 minutes during the day.\nThe best fares are almost always available on the most competitive routes, whereas routes to remote destinations with fewer flights tend to be more expensive. Qantas actually do often offer competitive prices, so don't ignore that option just because they are a full-service carrier. There are only a handful of main airlines in Australia, so it won't take long to compare their prices on domestic routes:\n\nQantas, the full-service national carrier, flying to all major cities and some larger regional towns (see QantasLink);\nVirgin Australia, a nationwide full-service airline, flying to major cities and a few larger regional towns;\nJetstar, Qantas's discount arm with limited service and assigned seating.\nSeveral airlines service regional destinations. Expect higher fares and fewer discounts.\n\nQantaslink, the regional arm of Qantas;\nRegional Express, covering larger towns and cities on the eastern seaboard and in country South Australia;\nAirnorth, covering the Northern Territory and East Timor;\nSkytrans Airlines, covering regional Queensland;\nSharp Airlines, covering several regional towns in Victoria and South Australia.\n\n\nCharters\nSee also: General aviation\nScheduled aviation only flies to a handful of the thousands of airports around Australia. There are numerous options to charter aircraft that may take you direct to smaller country towns or even offshore islands. The costs can be comparable to scheduled airlines if there are 3 or more people flying in a group. The Australian Private Pilots Licence permits private pilots to carry passengers and to recover the cost of the plane hire and fuel from passengers, but not to advertise for passengers or fly commercially. That said, if you check the web pages of local flying clubs, there are always private pilots willing to fly on a fine weekend if someone is willing to put in for the cost of the plane and fuel.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in Australia, Across Australia by train\n\nTrains are rarely a practical means of long-distance transport in Australia: they tend to be slower than driving, more expensive than flying and run less frequently than buses. A historical lack of cooperation between the states, combined with sheer distances and a relatively small population to service, have left Australia with a national rail network that is relatively slow and used mainly for freight. Nevertheless, train travel between cities can be very scenic and present opportunities to see new aspects of the country. It can also be a cost-effective way to get to regional towns and cities, which tend to have more expensive flights than those between the state capitals.\nMost long-distance rail services that exist link the regional townships with the state capital, such as Bendigo to Melbourne, or Cairns to Brisbane. Both transcontinental routes (Adelaide-Darwin and Sydney-Perth) are luxury services that are primarily aimed at tourists who have a lot of time and money on their hands, so unless you are a rail travel enthusiast, you should consider other options such as flying or driving, as they will usually be cheaper and faster.\nTasmania has no passenger rail services. The Northern Territory has the rail line linking Darwin to Adelaide through Alice Springs only, and the Australian Capital Territory has a single railway station close to the centre of Canberra. Rail service in South Australia is mainly limited to the Adelaide suburban network, though the Overland makes stops in some South Australian country towns on its way to and from Victoria.\n\n\nLong distance train operators\n\nLong-distance passenger trains in Australia are operated by a mix of one private operator and four state government operators. There is no centralised ticketing service covering all the long-distance railway operators in Australia, and you will need to buy separate tickets from each operator if your journey involves multiple operators.\n\nJourney Beyond - A private train operator running luxury tourist train services; The Ghan between Adelaide and Darwin via Alice Springs (only between March and November), The Indian Pacific between Sydney and Perth via Adelaide, and The Overland between Adelaide and Melbourne.\nNSW Trainlink Regional - Links Sydney to Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, and regional trains radiating out of Sydney to New South Wales country towns, including Dubbo, Coffs Harbour, and Griffith. Also runs coach services to some towns not served by the railway, and combination rail and coach tickets to these towns can be bought on their website.\nV/Line - Train services in Victoria radiating out of Melbourne to regional centres. Also operates coach services to some towns that are not served by the railway. Combined train and coach services are available between Melbourne and Adelaide, as well as Melbourne and Canberra.\nQueensland Rail - Long-distance passenger train services in Queensland, mostly radiating out of Brisbane, including its flagship Spirit of Queensland service between Brisbane and Cairns, but also runs the Inlander from Townsville to Mount Isa.\nTranswa - State government run, operating train services from Perth to Kalgoorlie and Bunbury. Transwa also operates coach services to much of the state where rail services operated in the past, especially the southwest of the state.\n\n\nMotorail service\nAustralia had a tradition of motorail, allowing you to take your car with you on special carriages attached to the back of the train. This service is now only available on the Journey Beyond between Adelaide and Perth or Darwin. You cannot remove your car at any of the intermediate stations.\n\n\nRail passes\nNo rail pass includes all train travel throughout Australia. However, if you are a train buff who intends travelling extensively by rail, there are some passes that may save you money. Plan your trip carefully before investing in a rail pass. Country train services are infrequent and can arrive at regional destinations at unsociable hours.\n\nDiscovery Pass. Use any NSW Trainlink services (trains and coaches). Get anywhere in NSW, and north to Brisbane and south to Melbourne.\nQueensland Rail Coastal Pass and Queensland Rail Explorer Pass.\n\n\nLocal public transport\n\nSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Wollongong and Newcastle have suburban rail and bus services integrated into the city public transport, with trams also running in Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, Newcastle, Canberra, and the Gold Coast, and ferries in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Sydney is home to Australia's sole Metro line. The remaining capital cities have bus services only. See those city guides articles for public transport details.\n\n\nBy bus\nBus travel in Australia is cheap and convenient, although the distances involved for interstate connections are daunting. Greyhound has the largest bus route network. There are no bus services from the other capital cities to Perth.\n\n Firefly Express, \u260f 1300 730 740 (local rate), +61 3 8318 0318 (international callers), enquiries@fireflyexpress.com.au. Firefly Express has services connecting Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. \n Greyhound, \u260f 1300 473 946 (local rate), info@greyhound.com.au. Greyhound travels daily to over 1100 destinations in Australia. It has a variety of ticketing including all-you-can-ride passes (called \"Whimit Passes\") that allow you to hop on and off as many times as you like within 15-120 days nationally, or 7-30 days between Melbourne and Cairns (\"East Coast Whimit\") (updated May 2023)\n Murrays, \u260f +61 13 22 51, reservations@murrays.com.au. Murrays has services connecting Canberra with Sydney, the NSW South Coast and snowfields. \n Premier Motor Services. Premier runs buses all along the east cost, from Eden in southern NSW, to Cairns in Far North Queensland. Despite having fewer destinations than Greyhound, their buses are comparable and their fares are around 10% cheaper than Greyhound. (updated May 2023)\n\n\nBy boat\n\nSydney, Brisbane, and Perth have ferries as part of their public transport system. Some smaller roads in the regional areas still have punts to carry cars across rivers and canals. The islands of the Barrier Reef have some scheduled services, and there are a few cruises that cross the top of Australia as well.\nHowever, large inter city ferry services are not common. Keep in mind that most car rental companies prohibit their cars from being taken onto ferries.\n\nThe Spirit of Tasmania. Australia's only long-distance ferry connects Devonport in Tasmania to Geelong, Victoria and carries cars and passengers on the route across Bass Strait daily. Day and night sailings are available. It is usually more expensive than flying but worth it if you want to take your own vehicle.\nSealink connects Kangaroo Island, Australia's second largest southern island to Cape Jervis in mainland South Australia with regular car ferries.\nSpencer Gulf Searoad (SeaSA) offers a short cut across the Spencer Gulf between Wallaroo on the Yorke Peninsula and Lucky Bay near Cowell or Franklin Harbor on the Eyre Peninsula. The service has been suspended frequently, but is operating as of November 2024.\n\n\nBy thumb\nHitchhiking is illegal in all states of Australia except Tasmania and the Northern Territory, although the punishment varies from none (SA & ACT) to a whopping $3200 fine (Qld). It is also illegal to stand on the verge or walk along freeways in all states, effectively making hitchhiking illegal in many practical places in all states).\nIf forced to hitchhike due to an emergency you may find a motorist willing to take you to the nearest town to obtain help. (Many major inter-city highways and freeways have emergency telephones to request help.)\nNevertheless, it is not uncommon to see people hitching in rural areas. The best time to hitchhike is early morning. The best location is near, but not on, the main exit from the town you are in.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nCycling the long distances between towns in Australia is not common, and most long-distance highways in Australia have poorly developed facilities for cyclists. for example, to cycle between Sydney and Brisbane you would have to allow 2\u20133 weeks with around 80\u2013100 km per day.\nIntrepid travellers do manage to cover the longer distances by bicycle, and have a different experience of Australia. Long distance cyclists can be encountered on the Nullarbor and other isolated highways.\nIn some states, former railway lines have been changed into rail trails. Rail Trail Australia website has good material of routes off the main highways, with the Murray to the Mountains Train being the best quality trail with the most to see and do along the route. In Western Australia long-distance cycle trails have been developed for mountain bikers. The Munda Biddi trail is many days through bushland, with huts provided for camping along the route.\nWherever you cycle - if you leave the urban sprawl of the capital cities, plan carefully and carry supplies.\nSee Cycling in New South Wales for details specific to New South Wales.\n\n\nHiking\nMain article: Hiking and bushwalking in Australia\nWalking through some parts of Australia is the only way to experience some particular landscapes. In Tasmania the Central Highland Overland Track and the South Coast Track are good examples of walking/hiking holiday to do items. The Bicentennial National Trail is one of the longest trails in the world, stretching from Cooktown in Northern Queensland, to Healesville in Victoria.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nWildlife\n\nSee also: Australasian wildlife\nAustralian flora and fauna is unique to the island continent, the result of having been isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years. Amongst Australian animals are a large group of marsupials (mammals with a pouch) and monotremes (mammals that lay eggs). Just some of the animal icons of Australia are the kangaroo (national symbol) and the koala. A visit to Australia would not be complete without taking the chance to see some of these animals in their natural environment.\n\n\nWildlife parks and zoos\nWildlife parks and zoos are in every state capital city, but also check out the animal parks if you are passing through smaller towns, like Mildura or Mogo, or staying on Hamilton Island. See the Warrawong Fauna Sanctuary if you are in South Australia, or visit the koalas with best view in the world, at Taronga Zoo in Sydney.\n\n\nIn the wild\n\nKangaroos and wallabies are in national parks all around Australia. You won't see any kangaroos hopping down the street in Central Sydney, but they're common on the outskirts of most urban areas.\nWombats and echidnas are also common, but harder to find due to their camouflage and tunnelling. See lots of echidnas on Kangaroo Island.\nKoalas are present in forests around Australia, but are notoriously very hard to spot, and walking around looking upwards into the boughs of trees will usually send you sprawling over a tree root. Best seen during the day, there is a thriving and friendly population on Raymond Island near Paynesville in Victoria. You have a good chance on Otway Coast, on the Great Ocean Road, or even in the National Park walk near Noosa on the Sunshine Coast.\nEmus are more common in central Australia. You will certainly see some if you venture into the outback national park at Currawinya\nCassowaries are found mainly in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland, but as they are critically endangered, you would be very lucky to spot one.\nPlatypus are found in reedy, flowing creeks with soft river banks in Victoria, Southern New South Wales, and the very southern region of Queensland - seen at dusk and dawn - you have to have a bit of luck to see one. Try the platypus reserves in Bombala or Delegate in New South Wales, or in Emu Creek at Skipton just out of Ballarat.\n\n\nConvict sites\nMuch of Australia's modern history was as a penal colony for convicts from the United Kingdom, and there are many historical sites that still stand as a reminder of the days of convict transportation. Perhaps the most famous of these sites are Port Arthur in Tasmania and Fremantle Prison in Fremantle, located near Perth, Western Australia. There are also many other sites scattered throughout the country.\n\n\nLandmarks\n\nAustralia has many landmarks, famous the world over. From Ulu\u1e5fu in the Red Centre, to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House in Sydney.\nSmall Australian towns have a tradition of making big sculptures as landmarks. See Big things in Australia.\nAustralia has thousands of heritage-registered sites, with 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nAustralia may not be a very religious country, but there are some churches that are well-known architectural landmarks. Some examples include St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney and St. Peter's Cathedral in Adelaide.\n\n\nNational parks\nSee also: Conservation areas in Australia, National parks in Australia\n\nPerhaps the best of what can be found in the natural side of Australia is best found in its national parks. Australia has more than 500 or so national parks, which makes Australia the country having the most national parks in the world. Although that number can make it somewhat hard to pick, there are some particular national parks in particular that stand out to travellers more than others. Some national parks (including Australia's largest) are located in very remote areas with no roads leading there, and the only way to access them is off-road driving in a four-wheel drive; be sure to make ample preparations and stock up on food, water and fuel before you attempt to visit one of these, and it is highly recommended that you rent a satellite phone despite the high cost in case of emergencies. Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia are also home to conservation parks, which are also protected areas of outstanding natural beauty, but not considered to be of enough national significance to be declared national parks.\nIn New South Wales, a trip is never complete without going to Blue Mountains National Park, just west of Sydney and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, home to several indigenous sacred sites, along with several lookouts, mountains and plateaus. Other national parks in New South Wales that are popular include Royal National Park, a popular beachside spot and the world's second oldest national park just south of Sydney, Kosciuszko National Park for being home to Australia's tallest mountain on the mainland, Dorrigo National Park or New England National Park for its Gondwana Rainforests, or a more isolated Mungo National Park home to the unusual but yet great \"Walls of China\" formation.\nIn the Northern Territory, the two most famous parks by far are Kakadu National Park and Ulu\u1e5fu-Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park, two icons of Australia which are both pretty self explanatory. Other popular national parks include Litchfield National Park home to several waterfalls, Nitmiluk for the Katherine Gorge, Tjoritja / West MacDonnell National Park and Watarrka National Park for their gorges and canyons.\nIn Queensland, similar to the Northern Territory, the two most famous and internationally recognized parks are the Daintree Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef, one for being the world's oldest living rainforest while the latter for being the world's largest reef system. Other popular national parks include Lamington National Park for its Gondwana Rainforests or Great Sandy National Park for being the world's largest sand island and the only place in the world where forest grows on sand or the Whitsunday Islands, home to some of the world's whitest beaches. Other important but relatively unknown national parks include Boodjamulla National Park, a world heritage site for its fossils or Carnarvon National Park for its landscape and rock art.\nIn South Australia, national parks tend to be of different quality, and by far the most recognised one is Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park, what first comes in mind for many who think about South Australia. Others include Naracoorte Caves National Park, a world heritage site for its fossils, or the Coorong, the world's longest beach and an important Aboriginal cultural site.\nTasmania has by far the most wilderness, and with almost a little less than 50% of its national parks as world heritage sites, it can be hard to decide which ones to visit. Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park is by far its most iconic national park, while Southwest National Park is the largest in the state. For those interesting in mountains that are easily accessible, Hartz Mountains National Park or Mount Field National Park is generally the national park to go, with the latter along with Ben Lomond National Park known for skiing and snowsports. For the parks of other kinds, Freycinet National Park is known for its beaches while Tasman National Park has some of the world's highest ocean cliffs.\nVictoria, despite being the smallest mainland state has quite a lot more to offer than you might think. Its most iconic one is Port Campbell National Park, and although the name of the park is not well known, one of its main features \u2013 the 12 Apostles \u2013 is what brings so much visitors to it. Others include Wilsons Promontory, home to the southernmost point of the Australian mainland, or Murray Sunset National Park, home to a pink lake.\nWestern Australia, being the world's second largest jurisdictions has plenty to offer. In particular, the one that's most known is Nambung National Park for its Pinnacles Desert, but others include Kalbarri National Park or Karijini National Park both home to several unique geological formations, or Murujuga National Park for being home to some of the world's densest collections of rock art. Purnululu National Park or Shark Bay both tend to be a bit far from Perth, but both are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, both offering something unique in sight. And if you thought that everything that's scenic has to be on land \u2013 you could be hardly ever more wrong. The Ningaloo Marine Park (and Exmouth and Coral Bay) have a lot to offer, especially for those keen in marine life.\n\n\nSpace\nMain article: Astrotourism in Australia\nThe vast open outback in Australia makes Australia a prime destination for space-enthusiasts. However, unlike the Northern Hemisphere, the constellations here are very different, owing to the fact that Australia is in the southern hemisphere. There are plenty of astrotourism sites, ranging from a cities, to as far deep in the outback as you can go.\n\n\nSports\n\nSport is an integral part of the Australian culture from the capital cities to country towns. As a testament to this, Australia has a track record of being one of the best performing teams at the Olympics despite its relatively small population. The majority of games are played over the weekend period (from Friday night to Monday night). Australian sports fans are generally well behaved, and it is not uncommon for fans of two opposing teams to sit together during a match, even if the teams are bitter rivals. While the cheering can get really passionate, actual crowd violence is extremely rare.\n\nIn the winter in Victoria Australian rules football (Aussie Rules, or in some areas just \"footy\") is more than just a sport, it is a way of life. Catch a game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Although originating from and most popular in the state of Victoria, the premier national competition, known as the Australian Football League (AFL), has teams from Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and the Gold Coast as well, and will have an additional team from Hobart starting from 2028. The AFL Grand Final, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground either in late September or early October each year, is the most watched event on the Australian sporting calendar. The AFL now runs a women's league, known as AFL Women's, during the summer. While obviously not as popular as the men's game, it still enjoys a decent following. The next women's season in 2020 will feature 14 teams from all of the current men's AFL markets.\nIn summer, international cricket is played between Australia and at least two touring sides. The games rotate around all the capital cities. To experience the traditional game catch the New Year's test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground played for 5 days starting from the 2nd of January, or the Boxing Day Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Or for a more lively entertaining form, that only takes a few hours, try a twenty-twenty match. The final form is \"One Day\" Cricket, international matches generally start at 1PM and finish at 10PM or 11PM (a \"Day-Nighter\"), with most domestic and occasional international matches played from 11AM to 6PM. The Australia Day One Day International is held in Adelaide every 26 January. The Ashes is a series of five test matches played between the Australian and English national teams. It is held in Australia every three or four years, and is one of the highlights of the cricket calendar. Whenever Australia hosts the series, the five matches are held in the five largest cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.\nThe Australian Open, one of the tennis Grand Slams, is played annually in January at Melbourne Park, including the main stadium of Rod Laver Arena, near the Melbourne city centre.\n\nCatch a rugby union Super Rugby game, with teams playing from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina and Japan in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney during late Summer/Autumn. The Australian national team, the Wallabies, also host international teams during winter, including New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina for The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri Nations tournament).\nRugby League is a winter game played mainly in New South Wales and Queensland, with the National Rugby League (NRL) competition being the premier competition. Teams include Melbourne in Victoria, Brisbane, North Queensland and the Gold Coast in Queensland, a team from New Zealand, with the rest of the teams coming from suburban areas in Sydney, and some in regional areas of New South Wales such as Newcastle and Canberra. The competition culminates in the NRL Grand Final, which is held every year in the Stadium Australia in Sydney. The biggest event in the rugby league calendar of Australia is the State of Origin series between teams representing the states of New South Wales and Queensland, which consists of an annual series of three matches of which two are played in Sydney and Brisbane, and the third is played in either of those cities or sometimes, Melbourne or Perth. Many fans consider the level of play in the State of Origin series to be even higher than that in the Rugby League World Cup.\nNetball is Australia's largest female sport, and there are weekly games in the domestic Super Netball league (which replaced a previous transnational league that also included New Zealand sides). The Australian national team is arguably the strongest in the world, with England, New Zealand and Jamaica usually posing the biggest challenge to Australian dominance.\nSoccer is a growing sport that is aspiring to reach European levels and is very popular at amateur stages. Many immigrants and second-generation Australians hail from European countries where passion for the sport is very high. The Australia national team (the Socceroos) won the Asia Cup for the first time in 2015 and have raised the sport's profile significantly. There is a national A-League, which is a fully professional league involving teams from Australia and one from New Zealand, with games played weekly during the summer. Most cities have a semi-professional \"state league\" played during winter, with most clubs being built around a specific ethnic/migrant community, for example a Newcastle league side Broadmeadow Magic, which was built around the cities' Macedonian population. While women's soccer is less popular as a spectator sport, it enjoys a decent following, with the national team (the Matildas) regularly participating in the World Cup. The women's counterpart to the A-League is the W-League.\nF1 Grand Prix The Melbourne Grand Prix in March takes place on a street circuit around Albert Park Lake, only a few kilometres south of central Melbourne. It is used annually as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races.\nThe Supercars Championship is a popular form of motor racing unique to Australia involving powerful cars, comparable to NASCAR racing in the United States\u2014though unlike NASCAR, which races almost exclusively on oval tracks, the Supercars series uses road courses and street circuits. Events are held all over the country between March and early December. The famous Bathurst 1000 is traditionally held in October.\nHorse racing is Australia's third most popular spectator sport after Australian rules football and rugby league, and races are held regularly in all of Australia's state capitals. The premier event in Australia's horse racing calendar is the annual Melbourne Cup, which also ranks among the most prestigious races in the world. The day of the Melbourne Cup is a public holiday in the state of Victoria, and people throughout Australia who do not usually follow horse racing will tune in just for this day.\n\n\nItineraries\nAnne Beadell Highway\nGibb River Road\nGrand Pacific Drive\nGreat Ocean Road\nGunbarrel Highway\nOodnadatta Track\nStuart Highway: crossing Australia north-south\nTourist Drive 33\nWaterfall Way\nMilitary museums and sites in Australia\n\n\nDo\n\n\nSwim\nin the surf. Australia has seemingly endless sandy beaches. Follow the crowds to the world-famous Bondi Beach in Sydney, or Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast. Or find a stretch all for yourself (but beware of dangerous rips on beaches, it is considerably safer to find a patrolled beach). The surf is smaller and warmer in the Tropical North, where the reef breaks the swell, and larger and colder in the south with waves rolling in from the Southern Ocean. (And yes, in the middle it is just right).\nin calm tropical oceans. Cable Beach in Broome is swept pristine daily by the tide, has perfect sand, and warm water - go in winter.\nin thermal pools. South of Darwin there are many natural thermal pools such as Berry Springs & Mataranka, surrounded by palms and tropical foliage. The most expensive resort in the world couldn't dream of making a pool this good.\nin freshwater lakes. Inland Australia tends to be dry, but there are freshwater lakes where you would least expect them. Explore inland of Cairns at the Atherton Tablelands, or head outback to the Currawinya National Park. Watch out for crocodiles.\nin rivers. If its hot, and there is water, there will be a place to swim. Wherever you are, just ask around for the favourite swimming spot, with a waterhole and rope to swing on. Watch out for crocodiles.\nin man-made pools. The local swimming pool is often the hub of community life on a summer Sunday in the country towns of New South Wales and Victoria. Many of the beachside suburbs of Sydney and Newcastle have man made rock/concrete pools called 'baths' where you can swim beside the ocean beaches.\non the beach! Find your spot by the water, and get out the towel. Tropical north in the winter, down south in the summer. As always when in Australia, protect yourself from the sun.\n\n\nBushwalking\nMain article: Hiking in Australia\nBushwalking is a popular Australian activity. You can go bushwalking in the many national parks and rainforests. Some areas also have guided bush walks by the local Aboriginal people, and these are an excellent opportunity to learn about the culture of the local Aboriginal ethnic group.\n\n\nDiving\n\nSnorkelling take a trip out to the Great Barrier Reef on the Queensland coast, or the Ningaloo Reef off the coast of Western Australia. Or take a trip out to Julian rocks off Byron Bay, or just dive in off the beach to see the tropical fish in Bundaberg.\nScuba Diving\n\n\nSports\nGolf\nRock Climbing\nMountain Biking. Try the trails in the Snowy Mountains or black mountain in Canberra, or cycle for days along the Munda Biddi Mountain Bike trail in Western Australia.\nHorse Riding. The horse has a rich tradition in the settlement of Australia since the arrival of the first European settlers. Relying on the horse to travel the vast distances and harsh environments of Australia was the foundation of a strong and lasting relationship between Australians and their horses. Today horse riding in Australia includes many recreational and occupational activities from cattle musters on vast stations, to the multimillion-dollar racing industry. On the outskirts of towns and cities and out in the rural landscape, you will see the many pony paddocks and much loved horses that are a testament to the ongoing passion and commitment Australian horse owners have to their horses and the enjoyment they bring.\n\n\nSki\nAustralia is not a premier worldwide destination for skiing, and its relatively low mountains mean that snow can be unpredictable. Nevertheless, if you there during (southern) winter months then New South Wales and Victoria have well developed ski facilities. Tasmania can also have skiing for a few months of the year, given the right weather.\nSee Winter sports in Australia\n\n\nSurf\nIf you think Australia is the most unpopulated and most remote place on earth where you can go to escape any trace of human contact, just find a good surf break in the most remote corner of Australia and you will be guaranteed to find someone surfing it. Australians love to surf and wherever there is surf there are Aussie surfers, any time and under any conditions. Virtually every coastline, except along the top end from Cairns across to Karatha has surf and surfers there to ride it.\n\n\nThrill activities\nSky Diving, all around Australia\nHot Air Ballooning, in Canberra, Brisbane or in the Red Centre.\nKitesurfing and windsurfing in and around Geraldton, Western Australia and at Coronation Beach, the windsurfing and kitesurfing capital of Australia\nWhitewater rafting in Tasmania or Far North Queensland.\n\n\nGamble\n\nIt has been said that if there are two flies crawling up a wall, then you just need to look around to find the Aussie who will be running a book.\n\nCasinos. Crown Casino in Melbourne is Australia's largest, located at Southbank, but there are others in every capital city and in Cairns, Launceston, Alice Springs, the Gold Coast and Townsville.\nDay at the races. All capital cities have horse racing every weekend, with on-track and off-track betting available. They are usually family occasions, and fashion and being seen are part of the event. Just about every pub in New South Wales will have a tab, where you can place a bet without leaving your chair at the bar. Greyhound racing and trotting happens in the evenings, usually with smaller crowds, more beer, and less fashion. Smaller country towns have race meetings every few months or even annually. These are real events for the local communities, and see the smaller towns come to life. Head outback to the Birdsville races, or if you find the streets deserted it is probably ten past three on the first Tuesday in November (the running of the Melbourne cup).\nThe unusual. Lizard races, cane toad races, camel races, crab races. Betting on these races is totally illegal and you'll find the TIB (Totally Illegal Betting) around the back of the shed.\nTwo up. If you are around for Anzac Day (25 April), then betting on coins thrown into the air will be happening at your local RSL club, wherever you are.\nAustralia has almost a quarter of all the slot machines (locally known as \"pokies\" or \"poker machines\") in the world, and more than half of these are in New South Wales, where most pubs and clubs have gaming rooms (labelled \"VIP lounges\" for legal reasons) where one can \"have a slap\" and go for the feature. Just don't get addicted.\nIf none of this appeals, and you just have too much money in your pocket, every town and suburb in Australia has a TAB (Totalisator Agency Board \u2013 betting shop), though these are usually sad, dim affairs filled with old men. Pick your sport, pick a winner, and hand over your money at the counter.\nGambling is illegal for under-18's. This can often restrict entry to parts of pubs, clubs, and casinos for children.\n\n\nRoyal shows\nEach of Australia's states and mainland territories is home to a royal show, which are agricultural fairs that also feature amusement rides and other forms of entertainment, and serve as Australia's equivalent of state fairs in the United States. These shows are held in the respective state and territory capitals, usually during the spring or autumn months.\n\n\nBuy\n\nSee also: Shopping in Australia\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe Australian currency is known as the dollar, denoted by the symbol \"$\" or \"A$\" (ISO code: AUD). It is divided into 100 cents (c). In this guide, the \"$\" sign denotes Australian dollars unless otherwise noted.\nCoins come in denominations of 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 20\u00a2, the 12-sided 50\u00a2, $1 and the tiny $2. Notes come in denominations of $5 (mauve), $10 (blue), $20 (red), $50 (yellow) and $100 (green). $100 notes are rare and sometimes hard to use in shops. Modern Australian notes are printed on plastic polymer rather than paper. Older paper notes (though exceedingly rare) may not be accepted by many merchants, but they can be exchanged for newer polymer notes at most banks for free. If the total of a transaction is not a multiple of 5 cents the amount will be rounded to the nearest five cents if you are paying in cash. The exact amount will be charged if paying by card.\nThe dollar is not pegged to any other currency, and is highly traded on world foreign exchange markets, particularly by currency speculators. Its exchange value to other currencies can be quite volatile, and 1-2% changes in a day are reasonably regular occurrences.\n\n\nCurrency exchange\n\nYou won't need much cash in Australia, as almost all businesses accept credit cards and debit cards. Cash is still handy to have, especially since some cafes, pubs and restaurants add a fee for card payments (usually 1-2%, which must be on a sign at the register).\nAs the Australian dollar is considered to be a major world currency, it is widely available at money changers and banks throughout the world.\nMoney changers in Australia operate in a free market, and charge a range of flat commissions, percentage fees, undisclosed fees built into the exchange rate, or a combination of all three. You can avoid rip-off rates by using banks in major centres, and staying clear of airports and tourist centres. However, both the best and worst rates come from the small private sellers, and you can certainly save money over the banks by shopping around. Always get a quote before changing money. You'll usually need to have photo identification with you, although you may be exempt if only changing a small amount.\nDedicated currency exchange outlets are widely available in major cities, and banks can also exchange most non-restricted currencies. These exchange outlets \u2014 especially the ones at the airport \u2014 usually give terrible rates, usually around 10% from current exchange midpoint. Australian banks usually offer an exchange rate around 2.5% from the current exchange midpoint. A flat commission of $5\u20138 can be charged on top. Some outlets advertise commission free exchange, usually accompanied by a worse rate of exchange. Don't assume every bank will offer the same exchange rate. There are vouchers for commission free exchange at American Express available in the tourist brochure at Sydney Airport.\nInternational airport terminals will have teller machines that can dispense Australian currency with Cirrus, Maestro, MasterCard or Visa cards.\n\n\nBanking\nOpening an Australian bank account is fairly straightforward if you have a residential address in Australia. You will need to provide evidence of your identity, such as a passport, to the bank in order for your application to be processed. The largest retail banks in Australia are National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), Commonwealth Bank and Westpac.\nCash dispensing Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are available in almost every Australian town. Australian ATMs are deregulated and may impose a surcharge over what is charged by your bank or card issuer. The fees can vary between institutions and between locations, but are usually around $2. The ATM will display the charges and you will have the option to stop the transaction before you are charged. Check with your bank as to what additional fees they apply to withdrawals in Australia.\n\n\nCosts\n\nAustralia is generally an expensive place to visit, with some surveys having ranked Australia as the third most expensive country in the world in terms of consumer prices, only behind Norway and Switzerland.\nDorm accommodation in a capital city is around $30, but can run as low as $15 in Cairns or cheaper backpacker centres. A basic motel in the country or in the capital city suburbs would cost upwards of $100 for a double. City Centre hotel accommodation in capital cities can be obtained for around $200 upwards for a double. Formule 1/Motel 6 style hotels (which are not common) can be around $100 for a double.\nCar hire (rental) will cost around $65 a day. Public transport day passes from $9\u201320 per day depending on the city.\nA cafe meal costs around $15-20, and a main course in a restaurant goes from around $25 upwards.\nA basic takeaway meal - a burger, sandwich, or couple of slices of pizza costs $10, a Big Mac costs $7.90, and you can usually grab a pie or sausage roll from $5.\nA middy/pot (285mL) of house beer will cost you around $8, and a glass of house wine around $10 in a low end pub. To take away, a case of 24 cans of beer will cost around $45, or a bottle of wine from $10.\nAn airfare between neighbouring eastern capitals is around $150 each way but can get as low as $60 if you book at the right time, or around $350 to cross the country assuming that you are flexible with dates and book in advance. A train trip on the state run trains will usually cost slightly less. A bus trip, a little less again. A train trip on the private trains will be the most expensive way to travel.\nThere is usually no admission charge to beaches or city parks. Some popular National Parks charge between $6 and $20 per day (per car, or per person depending on the state) while more out of the way National Parks are free. Art Galleries and some attractions are free. Museums generally charge around $10 per admission. Theme parks charge around $70 per person.\n\n\nTax\nAustralia has a 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST) that applies to all goods and services except unprocessed foods, education and medical services. GST is always included in the displayed price of any consumer purchases. Receipts (tax invoices) will contain the GST amount.\n\n\nTourist Refund Scheme\nIf you buy goods worth more than $300 at one place, over one or multiple invoices, you can obtain a refund of the GST (plus WET for wine) if you take the items out of Australia within 60 days. Unlike in many other countries, this applies to both Australian citizens and foreigners. Make sure you get a tax invoice from the supplier (which will have the goods itemised, the GST paid, and the ABN of the supplier). If possible, pre-fill the refund form online for faster processing. You may discard the packaging and start using the goods while still in Australia. Pack the items in hand luggage, and present the item(s) and the receipt at the TRS, after immigration and security when leaving Australia. If any of the items have to be checked in for whatever reason, make sure that you locate the customs office and let customs officers sight the goods before checking-in your bags. Also allow at least an extra 30 minutes before departure. The refund payment can be made by either cheque, credit to an Australian bank account, or payment to a credit card. There is no refund available for GST on services. Remember the goods are now considered duty-free, so they will now count against your duty-free allowance should you bring them back to Australia in the future, and you will need to pay GST on them should your duty free allowance be exceeded.\n\n\nCredit cards\nCredit cards are widely accepted in Australia. Visa and MasterCard are the most accepted cards. American Express and Diners Club are accepted at major supermarket and department store chains. Any card showing the Cirrus or Maestro logos can be used at any terminal displaying those logos. Australian debit cards can also be used via a system known as EFTPOS. UnionPay, AliPay and WeChat Pay are becoming more common in tourist shops and restaurants due to the rising number of Chinese visitors. It is difficult to use them in other businesses however.\nApple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and contactless credit cards are accepted. You will only need to enter a PIN if the purchase is over $200.\nAustralian credit cards are issued with a PIN. If you have an overseas card without a PIN you can still sign for purchases, however shopkeepers unused to dealing with overseas cards may not be aware of this. Try to have a PIN on your card if your bank allows it. If not, you may have to explain that you have an overseas card and wait while the shopkeeper finds a pen.\nCredit card surcharges are imposed at all car rental agencies, travel agents, airlines, and at some discount retailers (such as Aldi) and service stations. They are increasingly common in cafes, bars and restaurants. Surcharges are far more common and higher for American Express and Diners Club (typically 2%-4%) than they are for Visa and MasterCard (typically 1.5%).\n\n\nHaggling\nBargaining is uncommon in Australian stores, though vendors are usually willing to meet or beat a quote or advertised price from a competing retailer. It's also worth asking for a \"best price\" for high-value goods or purchases involving several items. For example, it would not be unusual to get 10% off an item of jewellery that was not already reduced in price. The person you are dealing with may have limited authority to sell items at anything other than the marked price. Attempting to haggle without a reason will most likely be perceived as rude in Australia and will be unsuccessful.\n\n\nTipping\nTipping is not customary in Australia, although tips are accepted if you freely choose to give one.\nRestaurants are required to include the cost of service and taxes in posted prices. You may, however, choose to leave a small tip if the service was exemplary. When paying by credit card, some restaurants give the option of adding a tip to your payment, although it is completely optional. Other places provide a coin jar or bowl by the cashier labelled \"Tips\", but the vast majority of Australian diners do not leave one. Bartenders are rarely tipped.\nOther types of service personnel, including hotel staff, porters, tour guides, food delivery drivers and hairdressers do not expect to receive tips.\nTipping is also not expected in taxis, and drivers will typically return your change to the last 5 cents, unless you indicate that they should round the fare to the nearest dollar. It is not unusual for passengers to instruct the driver to round up to the next whole dollar.\nCasinos in Australia generally prohibit tipping of gaming staff, as it is considered bribery. Similarly, offering to tip government officials will usually be interpreted as bribery and can potentially be treated as a criminal offence.\n\n\nTrading hours\n\nAustralia's base trading hours are Monday to Friday 9AM-5PM. Shops usually have a single night of late night trading, staying open until 9PM on Fridays in most cities and on Thursdays in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. Sunday trading is common in the main cities but does not exist in all rural areas. Opening hours beyond these base hours vary by the type of store, by location, and by state. See our localised guides for more local information.\nMajor supermarket chains in main centres are generally open at least until 9PM on weekdays (and often until midnight), but generally have reduced hours on weekends. Convenience stores such as 7/11 are open 24 hours in major centres.\nFast food restaurant chains are commonly open 24 hours or at least very late. Many food courts in city centres typically close by 4PM and completely close on weekends if targeting office workers, but other eateries and food courts in shopping centres have longer hours.\nFuel/service stations are open 24 hours in major centres, but often close at 6pm and on Sundays in country towns.\nAustralia's weekend is on Saturday and Sunday of each week. Retail trading is now almost universal in larger cities on weekends, although with slightly reduced hours. Again, Western Australia is an exception with restrictions on large stores opening on Sundays. In smaller country towns shops are closed on Sundays and often also on Saturday afternoons. Businesses in towns with heavy tourist visitation will often be open on Saturday and Sunday as a means of serving weekend visitors, but will take their weekends on Monday and Tuesday instead, so expect reduced service in some towns on those days.\nTourist-oriented towns and shops may stay open longer hours. Tourist areas within cities, such as Darling Harbour in Sydney have longer trading hours every night.\nAustralian banks are open Monday-Friday 9AM-4PM only, often closing at 5PM on Fridays. Cash is available through Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) 24 hours, and currency exchange outlets have extended hours and are open on weekends.\n\n\nEat\nSee also: Australian cuisine\nAustralian cuisine was mainly influenced by its British and Irish colonial heritage until the 1960s and 70s, but with a history of immigration from other parts of Europe like Germany, Italy, Greece and Poland, the influence of these cultures has become more evident in Australian cuisine than its British and Irish beginnings. The large influx of Asian migrants has also left its mark on Australian cuisine, with many Australian chefs incorporating Asian influences in nominally Western dishes.\nThe various Aboriginal ethnic groups have their own distinctive cuisines, though due to the fact that they make extensive use of exotic ingredients, these have for the most part not become a part of mainstream Australian cuisine.\nGenerally speaking, table manners in Australia conform to European norms.\n\n\nPlaces to eat\n\nThere is no shortage of places to eat out in the cities and towns. In addition to good restaurants offering cuisine from around the world, there are also the following:\n\nPubs usually offer a lunch and dinner menu, consisting of hearty Aussie staples like steaks, burgers, fish and chips, and chicken parmigiana.  Meals may be served at a bistro or restaurant area separate from the main counter.\nClubs such as bowling clubs, leagues clubs, RSLs are in many towns and cities. They are most common in the states of Queensland and New South Wales. Most allow visitors, and sometimes offer good value meals. A quick, free registration process is often required to comply with gambling laws.\nCafes, most towns and suburbs have a cafe or coffee shop, serving breakfast and light meals and cakes from early morning to afternoon. The vast majority close by 4PM.\nBakeries, usually a good place to buy bread rolls, a pie or a sausage roll.\nFast food restaurants, McDonald's (or Macca's), Subway and KFC are common. Burger King is rebranded as Hungry Jack's. Red Rooster is an Australian chain, offering barbecued chicken and other mostly chicken-based items and Oporto is an Australian version of Nando's.\nTake-away, milk bars, sushi stores and other take-away stores usually sell sushi, pies, barbecued (rotisserie) chicken, hamburgers, fish and chips, gyros, and kebabs.\nFood courts, most shopping centres have a food court, even in country towns.\nPicnic, the Australian climate is usually amenable to getting whatever food you can, and heading to the nearest park, river, lake or beach.\nBarbecue is a popular Australian pastime and many parks in Australia provide free barbecues for public use. Contrary to the stereotype, Australians rarely \"throw a shrimp on the barbie\" (also, in Australia a shrimp is referred to as a prawn). Steaks, chops, sausages, chicken fillets, fish, and kebabs are popularly barbecued.\nWineries, many of Australia's wineries have restaurants serving modern Australian cuisine that overlook their vineyards, where you can also purchase their wines to go with your meal. Typically only open for lunch, although some upmarket places offer elaborate multicourse degustation dinners as well.\n\n\nNative foods\n\nSee also: Australian cuisine#Indigenous food (bush tucker)\nIt may come as a disappointment that native foods are not actually available that much in Australian restaurants, nor consumed by Australians much themselves. They are available in supermarkets and in some of the remoter parts of the country. Traditional Aboriginal diets can include endangered species, the consumption of which is strictly restricted to specific communities and unlikely to be available to you.\n\nKangaroo, if you fancy some, it is available from many supermarkets and butchers. Barbecue it until medium rare, but best not to overcook as it may become quite tough. This red meat tastes much like beef and occasionally makes it onto the menu in restaurants, mostly in tourist areas. Kangaroos are abundant (over 50 million in the country), do far less damage to the sensitive native environment than hoofed animals, and produce far fewer carbon emissions as well. It makes a great environmental statement to make whilst barbecuing.\nCrocodile, meat from farms in the Northern Territory and Queensland is widely available around the top end, and occasionally elsewhere. At Rockhampton, the beef capital of Australia, you can see the ancient reptile on a farm while munching on a croc burger. This white meat tastes much like chicken.\nEmu, yes, you can eat the other half of the Australian Coat of Arms as well. Emu is a red meat that is low in fat and available from specialty butchers. Try the Coat of Arms in a pie in Maleny or on a pizza in The Rocks.\nPossum, mostly eaten in Tasmania (especially on Bruny Island).\nBush tucker, many tours may give you an opportunity to try some bush tucker, the berries, nuts, roots, ants, and grubs from Australia's native bush. Macadamia nuts are the only native plant to Australia that is grown for food commercially. Some of the other bush foods can be an acquired taste, though native seasonings are certainly worth trying, and are increasingly being featured in Australian fine dining restaurants. Bush tucker ice cream can sometimes be found at farmers' markets and outdoor festivals.\n\n\nBeyond cuisine\n\nAustralia has a good deal of British-inspired food that is not well known internationally. Definitely worth a try.\nVegemite, a salty yeast-based spread, best spread thinly on toast. If you aren't up for buying a jar, any coffee shop will serve vegemite on toast at breakfast time. It may not even be on the menu, but the vegemite will be out the back in the jar next to the marmalade. If you do buy a jar, the secret is to spread it very thin, and don't forget the butter as well. It tastes similar to Marmite in the UK or Cenovis in Switzerland. Australians are quite used to the taste, and may spread the Vegemite very thick; but this is not recommended for first-timers.\nThe Tim-Tam is a chocolate fudge-filled sandwich of two chocolate biscuits, all dipped in chocolate. You can buy them from any supermarket or convenience store. Tim-Tams are required to perform the Tim-Tam Slam manoeuvre. This requires biting a corner off both ends of the Tim-Tam, then using it as a straw to drink a cup of tea or coffee. This melts the centre and creates an experience hard to describe. Finesse is needed to suck the whole biscuit into your mouth in the microseconds between being fully saturated and dissolving. Tim-Tams are sold in packs of 11, so be sure to agree on the sharing arrangements before buying a packet with your travel partner, or onward travel arrangements may be disrupted. During summer Tim-Tams are often stored in the freezer and eaten ice cold. Not as good are the Indonesian-made Tim-Tams sometimes found in discount grocery stores. These can be differentiated by being thinner and often individually-wrapped.\nThe lamington is a cube of sponge cake covered in chocolate icing and dipped in desiccated coconut. It's named after Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901. The home-baked form can be found at a local Saturday morning market, or your local bakery. The plastic-wrapped varieties sold in supermarkets are not as good.\nThe pavlova is a meringue cake with a cream topping usually decorated with fresh fruit. Served on special occasions, or after a lunchtime barbecue. Often the source of dispute with New Zealand over the original source of the recipe.\nANZAC biscuits are a mix of coconut, oats, flour, sugar and golden syrup. They were reputedly sent by wives and care organisations to world war I soldiers in care packages, but the story is likely apocryphal. They are available from bakeries, cafes and supermarkets, and are popular in the lead up to ANZAC day (25 April).\nDamper is a traditional soda bread that was baked by drovers and stockmen. It has basic ingredients (flour, water and perhaps salt) and usually cooked in the embers of a fire. It is not available in bakeries and only commonly served to tourists on organised tours. Best eaten with butter and jam or golden syrup as it is dry and bland.\nA Chiko roll is a deep-fried snack inspired by the egg roll or the spring roll. Despite the name, it contains no chicken. Its filling is boned mutton, vegetables, rice, barley, and seasoning. Its shell is thicker than an egg roll, meant to survive handling at football matches. Available anywhere fish and chips are sold.\nThe Australian Meat Pie is considered to be the national dish by many. A variation is the pie floater from Adelaide which is a pie inverted in a bowl of thick mushy pea soup.\n\n\nOther cuisines\nCuisines widely available in Australia, often prepared by members of the relevant culture, include:\n\nBritish, Australia's colonial heritage is perhaps best represented by the ubiquity of fish and chips, and virtually every neighbourhood and small town in a coastal area will have a local fish and chip shop. Common types of fish used in Australia include flake (various types of small shark), flathead, barramundi and King George whiting. Unlike in the UK, fish and chips is typically served with ketchup and tartar sauce in Australia. British and Irish style pubs are common throughout populated areas of Australia, although they feature Australian staples such as chicken parmas, schnitzels and pasta.\nChinese, synonymous with the term \"takeaway\" in the past generations. Many Chinese restaurants still cater to takeaway addicts today, mostly of the Australianised Chinese variety, but major cities have small \"Chinatowns\" or suburbs with a large number of ethnic Chinese residents that have excellent restaurants serving authentic Chinese food. Cantonese Dim Sum is available in dedicated restaurants in most large shopping malls.\nThai restaurants are common everywhere. Sydney in particular is known as one of the best destinations for Thai food in the world.\nItalian, the Italian community is one of the largest ethnic communities of non Anglo-Saxon origin in Australia, and they have contributed greatly to the cafe culture that has flourished across the major cities over the past few decades. Restaurants either serve Italian food that has been adapted to suit Australian tastes, or authentic regional Italian food, with the latter tending to be pricier and in more upmarket surrounds. Head to Lygon street in Melbourne or Leichhardt in Sydney if you're a fan.\nGreek is not quite as widespread as Italian above, but good options exist in every city and town.\nLebanese and other Middle Eastern, especially in Sydney. A Manoosh is a tasty pizza variation that is somewhat more healthy as well.\nA fusion dish that's becoming increasingly popular nationwide is the halal snack pack (also known by many alternate names). It consists of halal-certified doner kebab meat (originating from Turkey) and chips, smothered in sauces of your own choosing, and often cheese. Typically served in styrofoam containers as a takeaway dish. In Adelaide, the AB is similar to the halal snack pack of the eastern states, but it usually not halal.\nIndian is available in most cities, and often represent a good mid-range restaurant option.\nJapanese, including bento takeaway shops, udon restaurants and sushi trains. They are often operated by Koreans, whose own cuisine is also well represented in the major cities (particularly Sydney and Melbourne).\nVietnamese, Pho and Cha Gio (spring rolls) are easy to find in the major cities.\nGerman, South Australia and Queensland in particular have had a long history of German settlement, and German restaurants can be found in major cities and in country towns that were historically settled by Germans. The schnitzel is a German dish that has been Australianised and is widely available in pubs and cafes throughout the country, though unlike German schnitzels, which are usually made of pork, Australian schnitzels are usually made of chicken or beef. A good selection of German or German-inspired sausages is also available at many butchers.\nAsian fusion refers generally to Asian-inspired dishes.\n\n\nModern Australian\nModern Australian is a recently developed cuisine that is often seen in fine dining establishments, analogous to Modern American cuisine in the United States. This cuisine mixes cooking styles and flavours from different parts of Europe and Asia, paying homage to the diverse origins of Australia's population, and often incorporates native Australian flavours from the bush as well.\n\n\nVegetarian\nEating vegetarian is available in Australia and many restaurants offer at least one or two vegetarian dishes. Some will have an entire vegetarian menu section. Vegans may have more difficulty but any restaurant with a large vegetarian menu should offer some flexibility. In large cities and in the coastal backpacker-friendly towns along the east coast, you will find vegetarian and vegan restaurants. The market town of Kuranda or the seaside towns of Byron Bay are a vegetarian's paradise. In other regional areas especially in the Northern Territory, North Western Australia and north Queensland vegetarians are often poorly catered-for, but most towns will have a Chinese or Thai restaurant that will provide steamed rice and vegetables. Sydney and Melbourne in particular cater well for vegans and vegetarians with a lot of purely vegetarian restaurants, vegan clothing stores and vegan supermarkets.\n\nQuick vegetarian options include:\n\n'Smashed Avo' is a mix of avocado and feta cheese, served on toast and with an egg. A popular breakfast option and (unfairly) associated with free-spending millennials.\nSushi rolls and tofu pockets, available at sushi shops everywhere\nVietnamese spring rolls (Bahn Mi) are also readily available with vegetarian fillings\nKorean restaurants offer rice bowls (such as Bibimbap) with no meat\nPie shops have spinach rolls (filled with spinach and ricotta cheese)\nMost food halls have a dedicated salad counter\nMore remote outback areas may have very few vegetarian options (lots of processed meat pies and little else), so it is worth packing some vegetarian supplies before you go.\n\n\nReligious diets\nPeople observing kosher or halal will easily be able to find specialist butchers in the capital cities, and will also find a number of restaurants with appropriate menus and cooking styles. Outside the capital cities, it will be much more difficult to find food prepared in a strict religious manner. Fast food chains often offer Halal certified meals in areas with large Muslim populations in Western Sydney and Melbourne.\n\n\nAllergies\nAustralian restaurants generally provide options for people with common allergies such as nuts and seafood. Ask the waitstaff if in doubt.\nThe gluten free diet fad has spread to Australia, and there is no shortage of gluten free products in supermarkets, bakeries and restaurants, albeit often at higher prices than the regular versions of those products.\n\n\nMarkets\n\nMelbourne's Queen Victoria Market, Adelaide's Central Market and the Fremantle Markets near Perth are perhaps Australia's best known examples of traditional European-style food markets. The Sydney Fish Market is one of the most iconic traditional seafood markets in the world.\nAll of the capital cities and most regional towns in Australia host a \"farmer's market\", which is generally held each week in a designated area on a Saturday or Sunday. These markets mostly sell fresh fruits and vegetables, as hygiene regulations in Australia forbid the selling of meat directly from market stalls. Butchers who set up shop at a farmer's market would usually trade their wares from a display cabinet within their boot (trunk). The attraction of markets is the lower prices and freshness of the produce. The attraction for the traveller will be the cheap and excellent fruits on offer - depending on the region and season (in places like Queensland or the Northern Territory, you're more likely to find mangoes while down in Tasmania you're much more likely to find apples). In regional areas the market is usually held outside the town itself in an empty paddock or sports field, markets in capital cities are easier to reach but the prices are typically more in line with those you would find in supermarkets. See the destination guides for details.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nBeer\nDrinking beer is ingrained in Australian culture. Although Fosters is promoted as an Australian beer overseas, it is rarely consumed by Australians, and almost impossible to find in Australia. Beer loyalties are strongly regional and every state has its own brews: Coopers and West End in South Australia, Carlton and VB in Victoria, Tooheys in NSW, XXXX (pronounced \"fourex\") in Queensland, Boags and Cascade in Tasmania, and Swan in Western Australia. Microbreweries are also extremely popular and any pub worth its salt will have half a dozen on tap: look for slightly sweet Pacific ales and hoppier Australian pale ales. A range of imported European and American bottled beers are available in all but the most basic pub.\n\nLight (Lite) beer refers to lower alcoholic content, and not lower calories. It has around half the alcohol of full strength beer, and is taxed at a lower rate, meaning it is also cheaper than full strength beer. Low calorie beer is sold as low carb.\nBecause Australians like their beer to stay cold while they drink it, draft beer glasses come in a multitude of sizes, so that you can drink a whole glass before it warms up in the summer heat. The naming of beer glasses varies widely from state to state, often in confusing ways: a schooner (SKOO-ner) is 425mL everywhere except South Australia, where it's only 285mL, a size that's known elsewhere as a middy or pot, except in Darwin where it's a handle, but in Adelaide a \"pot\" means a 570mL full pint, and a pint means what a schooner does elsewhere, and... you get the idea. The local beers and the local descriptions are covered in detail in the state guides.\nBottle naming is a little easier: the standard sizes across Australia are the 375 mL stubby and the 750mL longneck, or tallie. Cans of beer are known as tinnies, and 24 of them make up a slab, box, carton, bag or case.\n\n\nWine\n\nAustralia produces quality wine on a truly industrial scale, with large multinational brands supplying Australian bottleshops and exporting around the world. There are also a multitude of boutique wineries and smaller suppliers. Very good red and white wine can be bought very cheaply in Australia, often at less than $15 a bottle, and even the smallest shop could be expected to have 50 or more varieties to choose from.\nThe areas of the Barossa Valley (near Adelaide), Hunter Valley (near Sydney), Yarra Valley (near Melbourne) and Margaret River (near Perth) are particularly renowned for their wineries and opportunities for cellar door sampling, but northern Victoria and Mudgee also have a large variety. You are never too far from a wine trail anywhere in southern Australia.\nTry the local wines wherever you can find them, and ask for local recommendations. Try not to get taken in by the label, or the price tag. The best wine is rarely the one with the best artwork, or the most expensive price. However, it is probably wise to avoid the house wine if it comes straight from a cask (4-litre container). Wines at the cellar door are almost invariably sold at around 20% premium to the same wine in the shops in the local town.\nIf you still prefer overseas wines, the Marlborough region of New Zealand is usually well represented on wine lists and in bottle shops in Australia.\nSee also Grape grazing in Australia.\n\n\nSpirits\nBundaberg Rum (Bundy) is an Australian dark rum particularly popular in Queensland and many Queenslanders will not touch any other brand of rum. It is probably the most famous Australian made spirit, mass-produced in Bundaberg and available everywhere.\nFor many years one had to search to find other Australian distilled spirits, mostly from niche players, but there are distilleries in every state of Australia if you look hard enough and more are popping up all the time\u2013Adelaide gin distilleries 75\u00b0 and the Adelaide Gin Company have grown in esteem over the past few years. The tiny Sullivan's Cove distillery in Tasmania made waves in 2014 when one of their whiskies was named the World's Best Single Malt, kicking off a mini-boom in Australian whisky, and they repeated the feat in 2018 and 2019. If $8,000 for a bottle of their 2014 French Oak is a bit steep, drop into the Lark Distillery on the scenic Hobart waterfront precinct, book a gin blending experience at Archie Rose in Sydney, pick up a bottle of 151 East Vodka in Wollongong or after a few days in Kununurra you are definitely going to need an Ord River Rum.\nMixed drinks are also available, particularly vodka, scotch, bourbon and other whiskey mixers. Spirits are also available as pre-mixed bottles and cans but are subject to higher taxation in this form, so it is cheaper to mix them yourself. Spirits are served in all pubs and bars, but not in all restaurants. A basic spirit and mixer (vodka and orange juice for example) will cost you about $12 at a bar or nightclub, but can vary ~$9\u201318.\n\n\nLegal aspects\nThe legal drinking age throughout Australia is 18 years. It is illegal either to purchase alcohol for yourself if you are under 18 years of age or to purchase alcohol on behalf of someone who is under 18 years of age. The only legally acceptable proof-of-age documentation are an Australian drivers licence, state-issued proof-of-age card, Keypass card or a passport, and it would be wise to carry one if you want to purchase alcohol or tobacco and look under 25 - vendors will frequently ask for ID for anybody who looks to be 25 or younger. In Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, foreign drivers licences and foreign ID cards are NOT legally acceptable as proof of age documentation, and people who are unable to produce a passport or valid Australian ID will be refused service. Only actual ID documents will be accepted - photographs or photocopies will NOT be accepted.\nIt is illegal to go into a gambling area of a pub or club when under 18. Often there is a lounge, restaurant or bistro area in a pub or club that permits under-age people provided they are accompanied by a responsible adult over 18 and don't approach the bar or wander around. Some city pubs even have video games and playgrounds for children. Some country pubs have large open areas out in the back where kids can run and play.\nIn general, you can take alcohol (say a bottle of wine or beer) to consume at a park or beach. Alcohol consumption is banned in some public places as 'street drinking'. These are often indicated by signs and is particularly the case in parks and footpaths where public drunkenness has been a problem. However, if you are a family with your picnic basket and blanket out at lunchtime with a bottle of wine, you are unlikely to encounter any problems.\nAlcohol can be purchased for consumption on premises only in licensed venues: pubs, clubs and many restaurants. You can purchase alcohol for private consumption in bottle shops, which are separate stores selling bottled alcohol. In some states you can buy alcohol in supermarkets. In those states where you can't, bottle shops and major supermarkets are often found in very close proximity. Although licensing laws and hours vary from state to state, and individual stores have different trading hours, as a rule of thumb, alcohol is generally available in towns to take-away seven days a week, 8AM-11PM, from bottle shops, supermarkets, licensed grocers/milk-bars and pubs. Outside of these hours though, it is almost impossible to buy alcohol to take home; unless you're in the middle of Sydney or Melbourne, so if you're planning on a party at home; it's a good idea to stock up and check on the local trading hours so you don't run out at 12:30AM with no opportunity to buy more. Alcohol is not available at petrol stations or 24-hour convenience stores anywhere in Australia.\nPublic drunkenness varies in acceptability. You will certainly find a great deal of it in close proximity to pubs and clubs at night time but much less so during the day. Public drunkenness is an offence but the Police won't pick you up unless you're causing a nuisance. You may spend the night sobering up in a holding cell or be charged.\nDriving while affected by alcohol is stigmatized, policed by random breath-testing police patrols in Australia, and inherently dangerous. Drink driving is a very serious offence in Australia, punishable by a range of mechanisms including loss of licence. The acceptable maximum blood alcohol concentration is 0.05% Australia-wide, often lower or not allowed for operators of heavy vehicles and young or novice drivers. Police officers are also empowered to randomly test drivers for the recent use of prohibited drugs. Refusing any of these tests is a criminal offence. The operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of prohibited drugs or alcohol will always result in arrest and a required court appearance many weeks from the date of arrest and it can comprehensively disrupt travel plans. Random breath-testing is common early Saturday and Sunday mornings, and many people are caught the morning after.\n\n\nA shout\n\nBuying a round of drinks is a custom in Australia, as in many corners of the world. It is generally expected in a pub that when you arrive and make your first trip to the bar that you will offer to buy a drink for others you are drinking with. Similarly this will likely be done to you when someone else joins the group. This is called a shout, and incurs an obligation that you will generally return the favour in a following round, and that also you will generally maintain the same drinking pace as your associates in the round throughout the evening. If someone in the same round as you has an empty glass, who is ahead of you in drinks bought, you should declare that it is your shout, and make your way to the bar. If someone offers to buy you a drink, but does not offer to buy for the person who already has bought you a drink, you should say you are already in a shout, and decline. If they buy you and the people in your round a drink, they have joined the shout. Its generally not polite to switch between shouts during an evening. It you are in a large shout, and you decline a drink, you still have to buy a drink for the round when it comes to your turn. If you wish to skip a round, to do so on your shout. It is generally poorly received to buy a round, and then to refuse a drink when one is purchased for you. Often the drink will just be bought for you without even asking. Don't be surprised if someone who bought you a drink earlier in the night, later says that it is your shout. Not joining a shout can be awkward in some groups. The best way is to say you are driving, and you will buy your own drinks. This is also an acceptable way to drop out after one round, when the score is even.\n\n\nNon-alcoholic\nMilo is a malt and chocolate drink now made by Nestl\u00e9 that was invented in Australia, and has since become immensely popular in parts of Southeast Asia. It can be found in any Australian supermarket.\nAustralia has a strong coffee culture, especially Melbourne, a city with extensive Italian immigration. The joke is that Italians visiting Melbourne think the coffee is worse than their home city's, but better than every other city in Italy. Even service stations and fast food places will sell decent coffee. However, because of the strong preference for local coffee shops, many of the major chains in other countries don't exist \u2014 Starbucks has a tiny handful of stores in Melbourne and Sydney, and none elsewhere in the country. Don't be taken aback by the lack of chains; try the local flavour instead!\nTea is much less popular than coffee in Australia, but is nevertheless not hard to find; most places that sell coffee also sell tea. There are some high-end hotels that serve traditional English afternoon tea, while Devonshire tea is a fairly popular weekend pastime among Australians, with numerous bakeries serving it. Queensland is also home to small tea-growing industry.\n\n\nLearn\nMain article: Studying abroad#Australia\nAustralia is a popular destination for University students, especially from East Asia, Southeast Asia and India. Australia offers world class universities in an English speaking environment, along with potential opportunities to actually gain resident and work visas on a path to citizenship. If you are intending to study in Australia, you will need to be on a visa class that allows this. Students and academics invited to visit Australian universities will generally also need an appropriate visa, even if their visit is of a short enough period to be covered by a tourist electronic visa. For very short term or part-time courses, check with your Australian consulate or embassy.\nAustralia also happens to be a great place to get Barista certification, with graduates being maybe able to command higher wages in coffee shops back in their home countries. Such courses can usually be conducted on a standard tourist visa.\n\n\nSleep\n\nAccommodation is readily available in most Australian cities and tourist destinations. As with everything else in Australia, it tends to be on the expensive side by international standards.\n\n\nHotels\n\nAll state capitals have a number of 4 or 5 star standard hotels, often with upmarket restaurants, bars, room-service, and other premium hospitality services. Expect to pay around $400/night, although prices can shoot through the stratosphere or straight up sell out during major concerts or events, such as New Year's Eve in Sydney.  Other 2 or 3 star hotels are scattered around the inner-cities and inner suburbs.\nThe usual international chains are reasonably well represented, with Accor having a particularly solid presence across the entire price spectrum.  Major independent local chains include Rydges.\n\n\nPubs\n\nMost pubs in Australia offer some form of accommodation. It can vary from very basic shabby rooms, to newly renovated boutique accommodation. The price is usually a good reflection of what you are in for. It is still quite unusual to have a private bathroom, even in the nicer pubs. The rooms are often on the second floor directly above the bar area and can be noisy, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.\nOutside of the major centres, the pub is called a hotel. A motel won't have a public bar. A motel that does have a bar attached is called a hotel/motel.\nIn very small towns local pubs offer the only accommodation available to travellers. Accommodation in these pubs tends to be budget-style with shared bathrooms but private rooms.\nPub accommodation is even available in the centre of Sydney, making getting back to your room after a beer a simple endeavour.\nIf you travel as a single, and want a private room, pubs usually have single rooms at a discount over a double room. Most motels will charge the same price for one or two people sharing a room.\n\n\nMotels\nTypically, motel-style accommodation will have a private room with a bed or number of beds, and a private shower and toilet. Many motels have family rooms, that will usually have a double bed and two single beds in the one room.\nMotel rooms in the cities will generally cost upwards from $100. Usually the cost is the same for one or two adults, with any extra people charged an additional fee. Prices for additional children can range from free to $20 per child. During quiet times its not unusual for motels to offer standby discounts.\nMost motels will serve a cooked or continental breakfast to your room in the morning, for an additional charge. Some may have a restaurant or serve an evening meal. Some may have a toaster in the room and kettles are widely provided.\n\n\nHostels and backpackers\nBudget hostel-style accommodation with shared bathrooms and often with dormitories is approximately $20\u201330 per person per night. Facilities usually include a fully equipped kitchen with adequate refrigeration and food storage areas. Most hostels also have living room areas equipped with couches, dining tables, and televisions.\nThere are several backpacker hostel chains in Australia. If you are staying many nights in the same brand of hostel, consider their discount cards, which usually offer a loyalty bonus on accommodation, and other attraction and tour discounts negotiated by the chain.\n\n\nHoliday parks\nHoliday parks are an Australian holiday institution and a great way to stay if you have your own wheels. These are basically an upgraded version of caravan parks, but as the new marketing indicates, they now cater to regular travellers as well. A typical holiday park offers the following types of accommodation:\n\nCabins fully equipped with bedding, kitchens, TV, Wi-Fi and more, for travellers without their own home on wheels. Most can house 4 or more people with rates starting from around $100/night.\nPowered sites for parking your caravan/campervan/motorhome/RV. Some parks offer en-suite sites featuring a little bathroom with a shower and toilet.\nUnpowered sites are for those intending to pitch their own tent, starting from around $20/night.\nRegardless of where you stay, the price includes access to communal facilities including BBQs, showers, kitchens, self-service laundries, pools, tennis courts and jumping pillows. The largest park chains covering the country are Top Parks/Discovery Parks and Big 4, but there are also plenty of independent options.\nThere are a couple of caveats to holiday parks:\n\nThey're typically located on the outskirts of towns, so they're not very practical unless you have your vehicle.\nMost cater to families, which is great if you have kids, but not so much if you're looking for peace and quiet.\nDuring school holidays, parks tend to jack up their rates and require multiple-night minimum stays, and the best ones sell out anyway.\nIf you change your mind, too bad, since reservations are typically non-refundable.\n\n\nCamping\nCamping is a popular pastime. In addition to camping at holiday parks, national parks often provide cheap or free camping sites, which expect you to be more self-sufficient. Often toilets are provided and sometimes cold showers. Paid camping permits are sometimes required at popular parks, with some popular spots filling up during the holidays in summer. In Australia it is common to be within an hour's drive of a national park or recreation area that will permit some form of camping, even in the capital cities. Expect to pay around $5\u201310 per night per person for a camping permit, and national park admission fees in the more popular national parks (e.g.: Wilsons Promontory National Park, Kosciuszko National Park, etc.), however entry and camping is free in the majority of national parks further from population and tourist centres.\nSome other camping areas are run by government or even local landowners. Expect around $10 per person per night, depending on the time of year.\nYou can try your luck sleeping on a beach or pitching a tent overnight in a highway rest area, or out in the bush for a free bed. Most rest areas and beaches prohibit camping and many even prohibit overnight parking to discourage this. Generally the closer you are to civilization or a tourist area, the greater the chance of being hassled by the authorities.\nCamping in state forests is often preferable to national parks if you're after a camping experience over sightseeing, as collecting of your own fire wood is allowed (sometimes felling of trees is permissible dependent on the area) and camping is not restricted to camp sites. Some other activities that are generally allowed in state forests that are not allowed in national parks are: bringing in dogs/pets, open fires, motorbikes and four-wheel driving. State forests are generally free to stay in, although you will need to check locally if public access is allowed.\nCamping in RVs is a popular pastime for Australians, and many campsites are equipped for RVs and caravans, though they may or may not have power supply and mains water connections. The number of RV and caravan parking slots can be limited, so check if you can reserve a slot.\n\n\nFarm stay\nMuch as the name suggests, this usually involves a cabin or homestead accommodation on a working property. Suited for a stay of two or more days, this accommodation usually allows you to get a little involved in the running of the farm if you wish. It is common for dinner to be provided in the homestead, and a breakfast pack to be provided to your cabin.\n\n\nHoliday home\nHoliday homes are homes rented by their owners, often using local real estate agents or specialised web sites. Sometimes located in prime positions, but also sometimes in the residential sections of cities and towns. Minimum rental periods of at least 2 days usually apply, rising to a week during periods when they are busy. At a minimum will have bedrooms, a lounge, bathroom.\n\n\nBed and Breakfasts\n\nBed and Breakfasts tend to be a premium form of accommodation in Australia, often focused on weekend accommodation for couples. They certainly don't offer the discount form of accommodation they do in part of the United Kingdom, and the local motel will usually be cheaper.\nSometimes extra rooms in a person's home, but often a purpose built building. You should expect a cosy, well kept room, a common area, and a cooked breakfast. Possibly private facilities. Substantial discounts often apply for mid-week stays at bed and breakfasts.\n\n\nResorts\nThere are many true resorts around Australia. Many have lagoon pools, tennis, golf, kids clubs, and other arranged activities. The island of the Whitsundays have a choice of resorts, some occupying entire islands. Port Douglas also has many resorts of a world standard.\n\n\nServiced apartments\nServiced apartments are a very popular form of accommodation in Australia, and they can be found across the country in city centres, beach towns and ski resorts alike. Guests are typically able to stay for as little as one night, and discounts are often available for bookings of a week and over.  Rooms tend to be larger than in standard hotels, and amenities typically include a kitchen, washer and dryer, and separate bedrooms, which make these a cost-effective option particularly for families or larger groups.\nApartment hotels generally don't offer breakfast or have a restaurant, but there are usually cafes located nearby (often next door) which cater to guests.  Major chains include Meriton Suites and Adina.\n\n\nHouseboats\nHouseboats are available to rent on some scenic rural rivers, and provide an excellent opportunity to spend time in the wilderness. These usually have kitchens in them so you can bring your own food to cook.\n\n\nStation wagons and vans\nIn most parts of Australia it is illegal to sleep in your vehicle but it is possible to get around this by simply rigging up curtains all around the windows so no one can see in from the outside. Trade vans can be picked up for as little as $1,000, with a more trustworthy van setting you back no more than $3,000-4,000. Add a mattress, pillow, portable gas cooker, cookware and a 20 L water container and you are off. If you get caught the fine could be as much as $150 each, so do it at you own risk. But if you are strategic in where you stay you probably won't get caught. Just be sensible and don't disturb the locals. Also, be aware of parking restrictions in certain parts of the cities and town, although overnight parking restrictions are rare. The parking inspectors can be ruthless and a $100+ fine is not uncommon.\nAll cities and towns in Australia have free public toilets. Many parks, and most beaches have free electric barbecues as well. Popular beaches have fresh water showers to wash the salt water off after you swim, so for those on a tight budget (or for those that just love waking up at the beach) simply wash in the ocean (please do not pollute the ocean or waterways by using detergents or soaps) and rinse off at the showers. Almost all taps in Australia are drinking water, the ones that aren't will be marked. Service stations (petrol/gas) almost always have taps, so these are a good place to refill the water containers each time you refuel.\nSome of the best experiences you may have in Australia will be by taking that road on the map that looks like it heads to a beach, creek, waterfall or mountain and following it. You may just find paradise and not another soul in sight. And lucky you, you've got a bed, food and water right there with you.\nTravelling in a small group lowers the fuel bill per head, as this will likely be your biggest expense.\nEnjoy, and respect the land by taking your rubbish/bottles/cigarette butts with you and disposing of them properly.\n\n\nWork\nAustralian citizens, New Zealand citizens and permanent residents of Australia can work in Australia without any further permits, but others will require a work visa. It is illegal for foreigners to undertake paid work in Australia on a tourist visa. Be aware that any form of compensation for services performed, monetary or otherwise (e.g. room and board), counts as payment in Australia, meaning that such work would be illegal on a tourist visa. Volunteer work is allowed provided it is incidental to the trip (i.e. not the main purpose for the trip). Foreigners in Australia on a student visa are allowed to work for up to 20 hours a week during term time, and full-time during the school holidays. Working illegally in Australia runs a very real risk of arrest, imprisonment, deportation and being permanently banned from re-entering Australia. All visitors who do not hold Australian permanent residency or citizenship (including New Zealand citizens who aren't also Australian permanent residents or citizens) are not allowed to access Australian social security arrangements for the unemployed, and will have limited, or more usually, no access to the Australian government's health care payment arrangements.\n\n\nPayment and taxes\nMost Australian employers pay via direct deposit to Australian bank accounts and therefore you should open a bank account as soon as possible. Some banks allow you to open account from abroad, for example Commonwealth Bank and HSBC.\nYou should also apply for a Tax File Number (TFN) as soon as possible. You can apply on-line for free at the Australian Tax Office website, though you can generally get it quicker if you just go to one of their offices. You can start working without one, but you are advised to get one as soon as possible as your employer would have to withhold tax from your salary at the highest rate should you not provide one. Register your TFN with your bank as soon as possible, otherwise any interest you accrue will be taxed at the highest rate. The Australian financial year runs from 1st July to 30th June, and tax returns for each financial year are due on 30th October, four months after the accounting period ends. Check with Australian tax agents about Australian tax liability and filing an Australian tax return. A return can be filed relatively painlessly by creating a myGov account and linking it with the ATO (you may need to call the ATO for help linking your account if you don't have the right Australian-issued ID).\nAlong with your taxes, the ATO will collect a Medicare levy, 2% of your income which is used to fund the Australian public healthcare system. Some foreign workers are exempt from the levy; if that applies to you, make sure to apply for a Medicare Entitlement Statement so you can use it to get a refund. Apply early, as the statement can take time to issue and you need it when lodging your tax return.\nAustralian employers will make compulsory payments out of your earnings to an Australian superannuation (retirement savings) fund on your behalf. Visitors on temporary working visas who are not citizens of Australia or New Zealand should claim this money when they leave Australia. This payment is known as a Departing Australia Superannuation Payment (DASP) and you can apply online. New Zealand citizens can transfer their superannuation money to their New Zealand KiwiSaver account; contact your provider to arrange this.\n\n\nWorking holidaymaker scheme\n\nAustralia has a working holidaymaker program for citizens of certain countries between 18 and 30 years of age. It allows you to stay in Australia for 12 months from the time you first enter. You may work during that time, but only for 6 months at any one employer. The idea is for you to take a holiday subsidised by casual or short-term jobs. If you're interested in a working holiday, some useful skills and experience might be: office skills to be used for temp work; or hospitality skills to be used for bar or restaurant work. An alternative is seasonal work like fruit picking, although much seasonal work will require that you work outside the major cities. Working for 3 months in seasonal work will allow you to apply for a second 12-month visa.\nYou can apply online for a working holiday visa, but you must not be in Australia at the time. It costs $635 (as of April 2024). According to the department, half are processed within 1 day, and 90% of applications are processed within three weeks. On arriving in Australia ask for the working holiday visa to be \"evidenced\", so you can show your future employer.\nIt's recommended to arrive in Australia with sufficient funds which is a minimum of $5000 if you are on a working holiday visa. The cost of living in Australia is quite high and it may take a few days or weeks to get a job.\n\n\nWork visas\nWork visas in Australia change frequently and sometimes without any notice, so always check with your local Australian High Commission, Consulate or Embassy and the Immigration Department's website.\nThe most straightforward way to get a work visa (subclass 457, 186 & 187) is to find an Australian employer who will sponsor you. Your employer will need to demonstrate that they cannot hire anyone with your skills in Australia. Locally advertised jobs are usually explicit in requiring a valid work visa before your application can be considered. Getting the visa might take a couple of months from the beginning of the application process and you will need a medical examination by a doctor approved by the immigration officials before it can be granted (among other things, you will need a chest x-ray to show that you do not have tuberculosis). An employer with a good background and efficient immigration lawyers could get your 457 approved within a week. Your work visa will only be valid for the employer who sponsored you and you will have to leave within 30 days of your employment ending.\nRegional Sponsored Migration Scheme (RSMS) visa (subclass 187) is the easiest employer nominated visa to acquire, although you will have to live and work in a designated 'regional' area. These areas are mostly rural and far removed from the larger cities, although Adelaide does count in this scheme.\nSkilled independent visas (subclass 189, 190, 489) may be pursued if you have a valuable specialised skill and don't want to be tied to a specific employer.\nThere is also a temporary graduate visa (subclass 485) which allows graduates of Australian universities to stay on and work in Australia, and is usually valid anywhere from 18 months to 4 years depending on your level of education, and your major. Your major must be from a list of skilled occupations for which there is a labour shortage in Australia. This list is updated every year, and whether or not you qualify for this visa is dependent on the list at the time of your graduation, not at the time you begin your studies.\n\n\nImmigration\nYou can apply to immigrate as a skilled person or business person, but this process will take longer than receiving a work visa. You can also apply for permanent residency as the holder of a work or study visa, but your application will not be automatically accepted. If you have a lot of money, there are several investor's visas available which allow you to live in Australia with a view of obtaining permanent residency. After four years of legal residency which must include one year as a permanent resident, you are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.\n\n\nVolunteering\nThere are several volunteer opportunities in Australia. Many worldwide organisations offer extended travel for those wanting to volunteer their time to work with locals on projects such as habitat restoration, wildlife sanctuary maintenance & development, scientific research, and education programs such as Australian Volunteers, World Wildlife Fund, Gap 360 and Xtreme Gap Year.\n\n\nRespect\n\nTravellers are generally unlikely to insult or cause offence to an Australian through any kind of cultural ignorance.\nAustralian modes of address tend towards the familiar. It is acceptable and normal to use first names in all situations, even to people many years your senior. Many Australians are fond of using and giving nicknames \u2014 even to recent acquaintances. It is likely being called such a name is an indication that you are considered a friend and as such it would be rare they are being condescending.\nIt is generally acceptable to wear revealing clothing in Australia. Bikinis and swimming attire are okay on the beach, and usually at the kiosk across the road from the beach. It is normal to wear at least a shirt and footwear before venturing any further. Most beaches are effectively top optional (topless) while sunbathing. Just about all women wear a top while walking around or in the water. There are some clothing optional (nude) beaches, usually a little further removed from residential areas. Thong bikinis (more commonly called g-string bikinis in Australia as thongs refer to flip-flop footwear) are fine on all beaches and some outdoor pools for women and men, although they are not as common as conventional beachwear. Some outdoor pools have a \"top required\" policy for women. \nCover up a little more when visiting places of worship such as churches. In warm conditions casual \"t-shirt and shorts\" style clothing predominates except in formal situations. Business attire, however, is considered to be long sleeved shirt, tie, and long trousers for men, even in the hottest weather.\nUsing Australian stereotypical expressions may be viewed as an attempt to mock, rather than to communicate. If you pull it off well, you might raise a smile.\nAustralians are often self-deprecating; however, it is rude to ever agree with a self-deprecating remark. Boasting about achievements is rarely received well.\nSocial classes do not feature as prominently in Australia as they do in many other countries, and you will notice that tradespeople (\"tradies\") and manual labourers are very well paid and accorded a lot more respect in Australia than elsewhere. Be careful not to imply that you are looking down on people whose jobs may be considered menial by the standards of other countries. Service workers, including hotel staff, waiters, cleaners, taxi drivers and shop employees, expect that customers will treat them as equals.\nMost Australians are happy to help out a lost traveller with directions, however many urban dwellers will assume that someone asking \"excuse me\", is asking for money, and may brush past. Looking lost, holding a map, looking like a backpacker or getting to the point quickly helps.\n\n\nIndigenous Australians\n\nAboriginal Australians likely arrived in the Australian landmass 65,000 years ago and number over half a million people today. They have faced significant discrimination over the years since European settlement took their traditional lands, and sensitivity should be given at all times. Aboriginal people actually come from many different 'nations' with distinctive cultures and identities that spoke up to 250 different languages before European settlement.\nFor travellers, Aboriginal lands have varying degrees of accessibility. While many areas can be entered freely, some Aboriginal land requires permission or a permit, and some areas are protected and illegal to enter. Permits are usually just a formality for areas which regularly see visitors, or if you have some other business in the area you are travelling through. Often they are just an agreement to respect the land you are travelling on as Aboriginal land. Some Aboriginal Land Councils make them available online.\nSome communities and areas have placed sign requests from Aboriginal people not to enter. While tourism is welcome and beneficial to Aboriginal communities, efforts are ongoing to balance cultural tourism with cultural preservation, separating living spaces from tourist spaces, and respecting sites of worship. Even if your map states that an area is \"free to enter\", failure to abide by these requests is highly disrespectful and could also be considered trespassing. You should check before making plans to travel off the beaten track to confirm whether your intended destination is welcoming to tourists and whether a permit is necessary to avoid problems.\nUlu\u1e5fu, Australia's most well-known natural landmark, holds great spiritual significance to the Anangu people who live in the area; while climbing it used to be a popular tourist activity, the Anangu have long requested tourists not to do so, and it has been illegal since 2019. The Anangu feel themselves responsible if someone is killed or injured on their land (as has happened during past climbs), so please keep off. The name \"Ayers Rock\" is frequently used for Uluru overseas however it is almost never used within Australia itself and it is not recommended to refer to Uluru by this name.\nIf you need to refer to race, the politically correct term is Indigenous Australians. Aboriginal people is usually okay and referring to sacred sites and land as Aboriginal sites, or Aboriginal land is okay too, though these terms only refer to people indigenous to mainland Australia or Tasmania. Avoid using Aboriginal as a noun to describe a person, as some people see negative connotations in this. The terms \"Aborigine\" or \"Abo\" are deeply offensive and should never be used. The word native generally not a preferred term, but reasonably acceptable \u2013 just use indigenous instead. People indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands do not identify as \"Aboriginal\", as they are more ethnically Melanesian than their southern neighbours; just stick to the term Torres Strait Islander.\nOther areas to consider when interacting with indigenous Australians are:\n\nAustralia Day is considered a day of invasion by many Aboriginal people, and consequently protests against that day are frequent.\nIt is best not to mention the name, nor show any image of a deceased person to an indigenous Australian. Though Aboriginal custom varies, it is best to avoid the possibility of offence.\nPermission to photograph an Aboriginal person should always be asked, but in particular in the more remote areas such as Arnhem Land and Northern Territory.\nAvoid disrespecting sacred Aboriginal places like climbing on Ulu\u1e5fu or the Three Sisters etc. While this may sound obvious that it's disrespectful, the number of indigenous sites that have been damaged, vandalised, or even destroyed by tourists is unimaginable.\nWhile indigenous Australians have been given equal rights on paper, they are still often arrested or hassled by police for things that a non-indigenous person wouldn't usually get arrested for. Talking about this subject may be highly sensitive, and to this day, there are regular reports in the media of Aboriginal people being assaulted by police or dying in custody. In fact, despite comprising a little under 4% of the Australian population, indigenous men make up nearly 30% of the Australian male prison population. These topics should be avoided whenever possible.\n\n\nANZAC Day\nAlthough Australians are generally regarded as easy going, there is an exception for commemorating ANZAC day on 25th April every year. Many Australians will take extreme offence at any perceived insults towards the military and the sacrifices they made, and foreigners have even been arrested for damaging or even just playing around on war memorials. Most people will accept criticism of Australia any other time of the year, but not this day.\n\n\nReligion\nContemporary Australian society is rather secular, and only a minority of Australians attend religious services regularly. In the 2021 census, only 43% of respondents identified as Christian, with 38% declaring they had no religion at all. Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism are growing religions, with immigration helping to drive the trend. \nMost Australians are tolerant towards people of all faiths, and people wearing religious attires such as hijabs, kippahs or crucifixes will in general not face harassment, although Islamophobia, antisemitism and other types of religious discrimination do exist. In general people tend not to discuss religion, and attempting to proselytise or inconveniencing others with your religion will more often than not result in a negative response. \nAccommodating Halal dietary restrictions is largely possible in the main cities with many restaurants offering Halal options, with various certification bodies. Main supermarkets also offer Halal sections.\n\n\nBritish legacy\nIt can be offensive to some to suggest that Australia is nothing else but a sunnier United Kingdom. Comparisons to the UK are not necessarily offensive, but people will appreciate being acknowledged as a separate nation with their own distinct culture.\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nEmergencies\nThe number 000 (called 'triple zero' or 'triple oh') can be dialled from any telephone in Australia free of charge. This number will connect you with the police, fire brigade, coastguard or ambulance service after you tell the emergency operator which service you need.\nIf you want to contact these services but the situation is not an emergency, don't call 000: you can call the police assistance line on 131 444. This includes requesting a call out for noise complaints. Poisons information advice, which can also advise on snake, spider and insect bites, is available on 131 126. Information on locating the nearest medical services can be obtained by calling 1800 022 222 (except for Tasmania).\nIf you require assistance during a flood, storm, cyclone, tsunami, earthquake or other natural disaster you can contact the State Emergency Service in each state (except for Northern Territory) on 132 500. You will be connected with your local unit and help can be organised from there. If the emergency is life-threatening, call 000 instead.\nYou can dial 000 from all mobile phones. Mobile phones sold in Australia recognise it as the emergency number and will use any available network to place the call. However, if you have a phone obtained outside Australia, using the universal emergency number 112 is a better idea. Using 112 will use any available network, will work even if your phone is not roaming, and will work even if the phone does not have a SIM. 112 works from Australian purchased phones too. Starting from the 28th of October 2024 there will no longer be a 3G network, and your phone will need to support not only VoLTE calling, but also emergency calls over VoLTE (some phones are hard coded to use 3G or 2G instead); it can be hard to establish whether a given phone is compatible without dialling 000 (which should only be done in an emergency), though if it works with an Australian SIM you should be fine.\nHearing or speech impaired people with TTY equipment can dial 106. Those with Internet connectivity can use the Internet Relay Service, via the website.\nCalls from fixed line (landline) phones may be traced to assist the emergency services to reach you. The emergency services have limited ability to trace the origin of emergency calls from mobile phones, especially outside of urban areas, so be sure to calmly and clearly provide details of your location. Because of the number sequence for emergency calls, around 60% of calls to the emergency numbers are made in error.\nNobody will likely respond to your call unless you can effectively communicate to the operator that you need assistance. If you are in need of assistance, but cannot speak, you will be diverted to an IVR and asked to press 55 to confirm that you are in need of assistance and have not called by accident. Your call will then be connected to the police.\nExcept for 112 from a mobile, emergency numbers from other countries (for example, '911', '17' or '100') do not work in Australia.\n\n\nDriving\nSee also: Driving in Australia\nKeep a sense of perspective. Tourists are far more likely to be killed or injured as pedestrians, drivers or passengers on Australian roads than all the other causes of death and injury combined.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is prohibited. Most states use a prescribed standard of alcohol in the blood to determine whether driving is criminal. The prescribed (allowed) content ranges from zero to 0.05. Random breath testing for blood and alcohol is carried out.\nAustralia is a huge country and driving between cities and towns can take longer than you expect, especially if you are used to freeway or motorway driving in Europe, Asia or North America. While the major highways are comparable to those overseas, secondary highways in rural areas need to be treated with some care. Speed limits vary by location, road and by state. Avoid the stresses of fatigue by not planning to drive too far in a day. Authorities strongly recommend a break (with some walking outside the car) every two hours. Often, there are designated rest stops on numbered M, A routes as well as National Highways and Routes, but they are almost non existent on unpaved highways, state routes, B or C highways.\nDriving between towns and cities comes with a risk of hitting or crashing due to swerving to avoid wildlife. Kangaroos have a habit of being spooked by cars and then, bewilderingly, jumping in front of them. Take extra care when driving through areas with vegetation close to the road and during dawn and dusk when wildlife is most active. Wildlife is not usually an issue in major urban areas (with the exception of Canberra where a series of parks provides ample habitat for kangaroos, which often cross major roads).\nUrban Australians jaywalk, dodge cars, and anticipate the sequence of lights. Although most drivers will stop for a red light, running the amber light is common, so ensuring the traffic has stopped before stepping from the curb is always a good idea. People from countries that drive on the right will take a while to get used to looking the correct way when crossing.\n\n\nBeaches\n\nAround 10\u201320 overseas travellers drown in Australia each year. Most of these drownings occur at ocean beaches, where statistics put visitors at significantly higher risk than locals. Check the Beach Safety website.\nBeach goers should swim between the red and yellow flags which designate patrolled areas. Beaches are not patrolled 24-hours a day or even during all daylight hours. In most cases the local volunteer surf lifesavers or professional lifeguards are only available during certain hours, and at some beaches only on weekends, and often only during summer. If the flags aren't up, then there's no one patrolling. Many beaches in rural areas aren't patrolled at all. If you choose to swim, be aware of the risks, check conditions, stay within your depth, and don't swim alone.\nMany beaches in Australia have a sudden drop off which can take non-swimmers by surprise. If in doubt, ask the locals.\nHard surfboards and other water craft such as surf skis, kayaks etc., are not permitted between the red and yellow flags. These craft must only be used outside of the blue 'surfcraft permitted' flags.\nAustralian ocean beaches can sometimes have strong rips that even the strongest swimmers cannot swim against. Rips are almost-invisible channels of water flowing away from the beach. Many locals can spot rips, so if in doubt, ask. These channels take out the water which the incoming surf waves bring into shore. Beach goers can mistakenly use these channels or areas since they can appear as calm water and look to be an easier area into which to swim. Problems arise when the swimmer tries to swim back into shore against the outgoing current or rip, tire quickly, and end up drowning. Rips can be recognised by one or more of these signs: a rippled appearance when the surrounding water is fairly calm; foam that extends beyond the break zone; brown, sandy coloured water; waves breaking further out on either side of the rip.\nIf you are caught in a rip at a patrolled beach, conserve your energy, float or tread water and raise one hand. The surf lifesavers will come out to you. Don't wait until you are so tired you can't swim any more. You will probably find that local swimmers or surfers will also quickly come to your aid. Usually the flags are positioned where there are no rips, but this isn't always the case as rips can move.\nIf you are caught in a rip at an unpatrolled beach stay calm to conserve energy and swim parallel to the beach (not against the pull of the current). Most rips are only a few metres wide, and once clear of the undertow, you will be able to swim or catch a wave to return to shore. Never swim alone. Don't think that the right technique will get you out of every situation. In the surf out the back of the beach, treading water can be hard with waves pounding you every few seconds. Unless you have seen it happen, it's hard to appreciate how quickly a rip can take you 50 m out to sea and into much larger wave breaks. If you are at an unpatrolled surf beach, proceed with great caution and never go out of your depth.\nBeach signs often have a number or an alphanumeric code on them. This code can be given to emergency services if required so they can locate you quickly.\nCrocodiles and Box Jellyfish are found on tropical beaches, depending on the time of year and area. Sharks occur on many of Australia's beaches. See the section below on dangerous creatures. Patrolled beaches will be monitoring the ocean for any shark activity. If you hear a continuous siren go off at the beach and a red and a red and white quartered flag is waved or held out of the tower, it indicates a shark sighting, so make your way to shore. Once it is clear, a short blast of the siren will be sounded, which usually means that it is safe to return to the water.\n\n\nNatural disasters\nAs a large country, Australia is affected by a range of natural disasters.\n\n\nCyclones\nTropical cyclones (hurricanes) occur in the tropics (the northern part) of Australia between November and April, and you should understand how a tropical cyclone may impact you during the tropical wet season. The impact of cyclones varies with their intensity and your proximity to them. Weak cyclones may just cost you a day or two of your holiday to rain and wind while you stay indoors in your hotel, and an hour's drive from the cyclone's centre can still have good weather. More severe tropical cyclones can be deadly to the unprepared, may force you to evacuate and can seriously disrupt your travel plans. Even low intensity cyclones or tropical depressions in more remote areas can close roads for days to weeks at a time.\nOn average, a town in the tropics experiences a tropical cyclone every 30 years or so. The sparseness of population in Australia's north and north-west (where cyclones are most prevalent) means that many cyclones pass the coast with little impact on towns.\nStill, if you are planning to travel to the tropics during cyclone season, you should understand and review the Bureau of Meteorology's information page before you set out, and keep a general eye on the page while you travel for early alerts of any problems developing.\n\n\nFloods\nIn the tropical north the Wet Season occurs over the summer months of December, January and February, bringing torrential rains and frequent floods to those regions. It is not unusual for some coastal areas to be cut off for a day or two while the water recedes. It can still be a good time to visit some of the well populated, tourist-oriented areas, and, except in unusually heavy flooding, you can still get to see the pounding waterfalls and other attractions that can make this an interesting time to visit.\nFloods in outback and inland Australia are rare, occurring decades apart, so you would be unlucky to encounter them. However, if you are planning to visit the inland or the outback and the area is flooded, then you should reconsider. The land is flat, so the water can take weeks to move on, leaving the land boggy. Insects and mosquitoes go crazy with all the fresh water pooling around, and these things eat insect repellent for breakfast and are still hungry. Roads close, often adding many hours to driving times. Many attractions often lie on a short stretch of dirt road off the main highways, and these sections become impassable, even if the main road remains open. Plan to return in a few weeks, and the land will still be green, the lakes and rivers will still be flowing, and the bird life will still be around.\nThe wettest period for the south of the country is usually around the winter months of June, July, and August. There is rarely enough rain at one time to cause flooding. The capital cities are rarely, if ever, significantly affected by floods.\n\n\nFlash floods\nFlash flooding occurs in many eastern cities at least once a year, generally in summer, and is a nuisance. However, stay inside and follow the advice of SES and ABC local radio. Never attempt to drive in flood waters, dozens of cars are destroyed every year by the thought \"it's not that deep\". You don't want to be the person floating under that bridge waiting for the police to rescue you.\nFlash flooding often brings large hail, which can damage cars. Seek undercover (not underground) car parking.\nIt is usually predictable. You'll generally hear grumblings about a storm coming from locals, and bom.gov.au will list a severe weather warning.\n\n\nWater supply\nAustralia is a very dry country with large areas of desert, and can also get very hot.\nWhen travelling in remote areas, away from paved roads, where the potential to become stranded for up to a week without seeing another vehicle is very real, it is vital that you carry your own water supply (4 gal or 7 L per person per day). Do not be misled by entries on maps such as 'well' or 'spring' or 'tank' (or any entry suggesting that there is a body of water). Nearly all are dry, and most inland lakes are dry salt pans.\nMany cities and towns have water restrictions, limiting use of water in activities like washing cars, watering gardens, or public showers. It is common to see signs in accommodation asking visitors to limit the length of their showers.\nIt is common for many regional towns public bathrooms water supply to be non-potable. Do not drink from a tap labeled \"Do not drink\" or \"Non-potable\", as this is generally just untreated groundwater.\n\n\nEarthquakes\nAlthough Australia is not located on any plate boundaries, earthquakes occur from time to time. These are usually minor and very rarely cause major damage or fatalities.\n\n\nBushfires\nBushfires are a seasonal danger in many parts of Australia - and if you're venturing out into the bushland or rural areas it pays to check the fire danger and the status of any bushfire activity first. Although most fires are quickly controlled, on very hazardous fire days, bushfires can be life-threatening - especially if on foot, or not having the protection of a substantial building.\nIf you are caught in a bushfire, most fires will pass over quickly. You need to find shelter that will protect you from the smoke and radiant heat. A house is best, then a car, then a clearing, a cave, or on the beach is the best location. Wet everything that you can. Stay low and cover your mouth. Cover yourself with non-flammable (woollen) clothing or blankets, and reduce the skin directly exposed to the heat. If you have access to a tap gather water early; don't rely on water pressure as the fire front approaches.\n\nThe Fire Danger Rating (pictured to the right) tells you how dangerous a fire would be if one started. It is not a predictor of how likely a bushfire is to occur.\nSevere: Hot, dry and windy conditions. A fire that starts in these conditions may be uncontrollable. Only well prepared buildings that are actively defended can provide safety. Leave at the first sign of fire.\nExtreme: Hot dry and windy conditions. Any fires that start and take hold will be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving. Only homes and buildings built to withstand bushfires that are well prepared and actively defended may provide safety. Avoid forested areas, thick bush or long, dry grass, It is recommended to leave such areas to ensure you are not caught up in a bushfire.\nCatastrophic/code red: These are the worst conditions possible for a bush or grass fire. Avoid forested areas, thick bush or long, dry grass. It is highly advisable to leave forested and bushy areas.\nIt is worth noting that many locals will leave their outback homes to seek refuge in large towns for the entire day, on the few days per year designated as \"Catastrophic\".\n\n\nNational parks and state forests\nIf the fire risk is extreme or higher, national parks may be closed, especially the backcountry areas, so you will need to have an alternative plan if you intend to camp or hike in parks during summer. If there is a fire in a park, it will usually be closed entirely.\nIf you are staying in a park or forest during an extreme fire danger period the safest option is to leave the night before or early in the day. If you learn of a fire, or see smoke, take action quickly.\n\n\nTravelling during active fires or during the fire season\nIf you are driving outside of cities during bushfire season, tune in to local ABC radio. During a bushfire or any other ongoing emergency, every thirty minutes a warning siren will sound, followed by an update on the current bushfire situation in that area. You may receive evacuation warnings on your phone.\nEmergency and bushfire management is a state responsibility in Australia - so find the website or app appropriate for the state you are in. Websites such as Emergency WA and VicEmergency list all current emergencies in their respective states and are often the most up-to-date method of getting information about a current emergency.\nIt is possible that you will get yourself into a situation where it becomes too late to leave.\nDuring the bushfire season, have a plan consisting of two escape routes, and the ability to pack what you need quickly.\nShopping Centres or Main streets of built up towns are safe locations to be in during Extreme or Code Red days, unless you hear otherwise via radio.\nEntire country towns can sometimes be evacuated when there is a bushfire threatening them. Often there can be no signs of the fire at evacuation time, but you should leave early, as evacuating through a fire front is dangerous. The best advice is just to move on, and not stay around to watch.\n\n\nLighting fires\nMake sure any fires you light are legal and kept under control. The fire service operates a total fire ban system during periods of extreme fire danger. When a total fire ban is in place all outdoor fires are forbidden. Most parks will advertise a ban, and it is your responsibility to check the local fire danger levels. Fines or even jail terms apply for lighting fires that get out of control, not to mention the feeling you may get at being responsible for the property, wildlife, and person damage that you may cause.\n\n\nVenomous and dangerous creatures\nSee also: Pests\nAlthough Australia is home to many of the deadliest species of insects, reptiles and marine life on the planet, the traveller is unlikely to encounter any of these in an urban environment, and even in the bush these creatures try to avoid humans for the most part. The vast majority of deaths from bites and stings in Australia are due to allergic reactions to bees and wasps.\nSome of the information spread about Australia's dangerous wildlife is blown out of proportion, often jokingly by Australians themselves. However, you should take warnings about jellyfish and crocodiles seriously in the tropics, and keep your distance from snakes in the national parks and bushland.\nIf travelling in rural areas it would be a good idea to carry basic first aid equipment including compression bandages and to learn what to do after a snake or spider bite.\n\n\nSnakes\nIt's not common to encounter snakes in urbanised areas in Australia, but they are common in grassland, national parks and other bushland. Snakes will generally try to put as much distance between themselves and you as possible, so if you see a snake while out walking, simply go around it or walk the other way. Walking blindly into dense bush and grassy areas is not advisable, as snakes may be hiding there. For the most part, snakes fear humans and will be long gone before you ever get the chance to see them.\nNever try to pick up any snake, even if you believe it to be a non-venomous species. Most people bitten by snakes were trying to pick up the snake or kill the creature, or inadvertently step on one while out walking.\nAustralia has some snakes that are deadly. So treat all snakes with respect, and seek medical treatment urgently for any snake bite. Take a first-aid kit suitable for snake-bites if you are going off the beaten track. If bitten you should immobilise the wound by wrapping the affected area tightly with strips of clothing or bandages and seek immediate medical help. Do not clean the wound as venom residues can be tested to determine the anti-venom to use. If you are in an isolated area send someone else for help. The venom of some snakes (the taipan in particular) can take effect within fifteen minutes, but if the wound is immediately immobilised and you rest it is possible to delay the onset of the venom spreading by one to a few hours. Polyvalent anti-venoms are available in most hospitals that contain anti-venom for all dangerous Australian snakes.\n\n\nSpiders\n\nAlthough famous for its arachnids, fatalities from spiders in Australia are extremely rare. It is common to see spiders in Australia, and most will do you no harm. Wear gloves while gardening or handling leaf litter. Check or shake out clothing, shoes, etc. that have been left outside before putting them on. Don't put your fingers under rocks or into tree holes, where spiders might be. Some spiders are commonly found inside buildings and homes, including the large and hairy Huntsman spiders, that are generally harmless, and reduce insect pests like cockroaches. The large spider webs strung between trees occupied by garden or orb weaving spiders are more an annoyance than a danger.\nHowever, some spiders are also very dangerous. The world's most venomous spider is the Sydney Funnel-Web spider, found in and around Sydney and eastern New South Wales - usually under rocks and leaf litter. The spider is anywhere up to 5 cm large, and is usually black. If you are in an area that is known for having Funnel-Web spiders and you are bitten by a spider that you believe could be a Funnel-Web it is important you get to hospital as quickly as possible. The Funnel-Web spends most of its time underground (it can typically live for only 30 minutes outside a humid hole) and therefore you are very unlikely to encounter one walking around. The last confirmed fatality was in 1979.\nThe Red Back spider (usually easily identified by a red mark on its abdomen) is common and after a bite it is important to seek medical attention, although it is not as urgent as with a Funnel-Web. Red Backs typically hide in dark places and corners. It is highly unusual to see them indoors; however, they can hide in sheds, around outdoor tables and chairs and under rocks or other objects sitting on the ground.\nFirst aid treatment for spider bites may vary in Australia compared to other areas of the world. Always seek medical advice after a bite has occurred. If possible, you should attempt to identify the creature that bit you. Take a photo or trap it so that the appropriate anti-venom can be administered swiftly. But don't risk getting bitten again.\n\n\nJellyfish\nTravellers in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory, or northern Western Australia should be aware of the risk of fatal stings from the Box Jellyfish if swimming in the ocean between October and May. They are very hard to detect and can be found in very shallow water. Stings from these jellyfish are 'excruciating' and often fatal. Vinegar applied immediately to adhering tentacles will lessen the amount of venom injected, but immediate medical assistance will be required. The danger season varies by location. In general the jellyfish are found close to shore, as they reproduce in the estuaries. They are not generally found out on the Great Barrier Reef, and many people swim on the reef without taking any precautions. Seek out reliable local information. Some locals at the beach can be cavalier to the risks.\nIrukandji are another species of tiny (fingernail sized) jellyfish that inhabit the waters off Northern Australia and the surrounding Indo-Pacific islands. They are also very hard to see, and can be dangerous, although stings are rare. Unlike the box jellyfish they are found out on the reef. The initial sting can go unnoticed. There is debate as to whether they can be fatal, but they certainly can place a victim in hospital, and cause extreme pain lasting days. If you have nausea or shooting pains shortly after emerging from the water seek medical treatment.\nA \"stinger-suit\" that is resistant to jellyfish stings costs around $100 or can be hired for around $20 a week.\n\n\nBlue ring octopus\nFound in rock pools around the coasts of Australia is the tiny Blue Ring Octopus. Usually a dull sandy-beige colour, the creature has bright blue circles on its skin if threatened. The Blue Ring Octopus is rare and shy. Avoid placing your hand under rocks or in crevaces in rock pools or near the shore as this is where they tend to hide. Most locals do the same. It has a powerful paralysing toxin which can cause death unless artificial respiration is provided. In the history of Australia there are only two confirmed deaths by Blue Ring Octopus.\n\n\nCrocodiles\n\nTravellers in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory or north Western Australia should be aware of the risk of fatal attacks by saltwater crocodiles in and adjacent to northern waters (ocean, estuarine and fresh water locations) between King Sound, Western Australia, and Rockhampton, Queensland. Saltwater crocodiles in these areas can reach 25 feet in length and can attack in water without warning. Despite what their name implies, they can be found in both salt and fresh water. On land, crocodiles usually lie motionless, but they have the ability to move with extraordinary speed in short bursts. There are relatively few attacks causing injury \u2013 most attacks are fatal. Dangerous swimming areas will usually have prominent warning signs. In these regions only swim in inland waters if you are specifically advised that they are safe. Since 1970 there has been about one crocodile attack on a human each year.\nThe smaller freshwater crocodile is, unlike the saltwater, timid and will avoid humans if possible. The freshwater may attack to defend itself or its eggs or if startled. They can inflict a nasty bite but due to their small jaws and teeth this will rarely cause death in humans.\n\n\nDangerous flora\nThe Gympie bush (Dendrocnide moroides), also known as the stinging tree, is a stinging plant, whose microscopic stinging hairs on leaves and branches can cause severe pain for up to several weeks. They are mostly found in northeast Queensland, especially in rain forest clearings. However, the Gympie bush and other closely related species (there are about five) of stinging tree can be found in southeast Queensland, and further south in eastern Australia. People bushwalking in such areas are advised not to touch the plant for any reason.\n\n\nCrime and policing\nCrime rates in Australia are roughly comparable with other Western countries: few travellers will be victims of crime. You should take normal precautions against bag snatching, pickpocketing and the like. Some cities and towns have areas that can be dangerous at night, but these are generally off the tourist trail and highly unlikely for you to wander into by accident.\nAustralian police are generally approachable and trustworthy, and you should report assaults, theft or other crime to the police as soon as possible.\nThere are two types of police in Australia: the state/territorial police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Typically you will only interact with the state police, as the AFP is largely dedicated to very specific government-related roles, the exception being the Australian Capital Territory where the AFP is the main police force, operating under the name of ACT Policing.\nUnder no circumstances should you offer an Australian police officer (or for that matter, any other government official such as a customs officer) a bribe or gratuity, as this is a crime and they will enforce the laws against it.\nWhen leaving your car alone, make sure it is locked, that the windows are rolled up, and that there are no obvious targets for theft in the vehicle, as thieves will often smash windows to get at a phone, GPS or bag that is visible in the car.\n\n\nScams\nAttempts to scam tourists are not prevalent in Australia; take normal precautions such as finding out a little bit about your destination. There have been rare instances of criminals tampering with ATMs so that cash is trapped inside them, or so that they record card details for thieves. You should check your transaction records for odd transactions after using an ATMs and immediately contact the bank controlling the ATM if a transaction seems to be successful but the machine doesn't give you any cash. Always cover the keypad with your hand when entering your PIN to prevent any skimming devices which have cameras recording your PIN.\nATM Skimming is rare and easily avoided by using ATMs from trusted banks (ANZ, Commonwealth, Westpac, Nab), or ATMs located inside a bank \"gallery\" which are generally open 24/7 but are more secure than an outdoor ATM.\nAdditionally, the ATO will never try to ask you to pay off your debts with Spotify or iTunes gift cards, and these ongoing scams have been targeting especially the elderly and those who are unaware of them. If you go to a Coles, Woolies, Myer, Target, Big W, Kmart etc. there will be warning notices at all checkouts, and it can never hurt to read them.\n\n\nRacism\nAustralia is outwardly a multicultural and racially tolerant society and there are strong laws that prohibit hate speech and other forms of discrimination on grounds of race. Nevertheless, racism is still a sensitive subject for a nation still not fully reconciled to its history of colonial occupation. Forced appropriation of Aboriginal lands along with formal discrimination, state-sanctioned racism and even forced separation of Aboriginal children (known as the Stolen Generations) from their families extended well into the 20th century. Gradual change throughout the last century saw the abandonment of the white-only immigration policy, citizenship for the Aboriginal people, and the establishment of large communities of Asian, Middle Eastern and African origin. However, to this day, Aboriginal people are still discriminated against, and while on paper they have equal rights, they are often charged for things that a white person would usually not.\nVisitors to Australia are fortunately unlikely to encounter random incidents of racial abuse. If it does happen then you can report it to the police and expect action to be taken. Violent incidents are even rarer.\nWords referring to racial background can be used between friends of different ethnic groups, but it is strongly advised not to try them out yourself. You may well hear Pom (British), Yank (American), Paki (Indian sub-continent), Wog (Southern European or Middle Eastern) and Curry Muncher (South Indian) being used. In particular British people would regard some of these terms as particularly racist, but they are used far more casually in Australia. Never refer to Aboriginal people as \"Abos\", \"native tribes\", \"Aborigines\", \"Noogas\" or \"ATSI\" as they are regarded as highly racist terms.\nThere are anti-immigration and anti-multicultural groups that operate in Australian society, for the most part agitating against the immigration of people from Muslim and African countries. As a visitor you would be unlikely to come into contact with them, although if it's late at night in a pub, and you start prodding people for their racial views, then all bets are off \u2014 be prepared for anything. The western suburbs of Melbourne has experienced some violent crime involving youths of African descent, which in turn has been greatly exaggerated by much of the local media and some politicians, fuelling racist sentiments.\nIt is not offensive to use Aussie (Ozzie) to describe Australian people, but it isn't a term Australians generally use to self-identify. They are more likely to apply it to things (Aussie Rules, etc.) than to themselves. When the chant of Aussie, Aussie, Aussie \u2014 Oi Oi Oi goes up at an international sporting event, some Australians will cringe, and others will join in. Often this depends on their own perceived social standing, or their state of inebriation, or both.\nAnd while Australia may seem multicultural in major cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Newcastle, Hobart or Canberra; rural areas are usually less so and stick to their Anglo-Celtic roots. People who do not look Aussie on the outside are often subject to racism, though this is usually targeted at immigrants (often those of Vietnamese, Middle Eastern or African descent) rather than tourists.\n\n\nTobacco\nAustralia is likely the world's most expensive country for smokers: a single cigarette pack costs upwards of $50, and vaping is illegal unless you have a doctor's prescription.  Black market loose tobacco, known as \"chop-chop\", is widely available but often mouldy due to improper storage and/or bulked up with dubious ingredients.\n\n\nIllegal drugs\nOpium, heroin, amphetamines (speed), cocaine (\"coke\"), LSD and ecstasy (\"molly\") are all illegal to possess and to sell in all jurisdictions of Australia. Trafficking offences carry a long jail term, and in serious cases can even lead to life imprisonment. Australia shares information on drug trafficking with other countries, even those with the death penalty.\nMedical use of cannabis (\"marijuana\"/\"weed\"/\"pot\"/\"gunja\") is legal on a federal level, although obtaining a prescription is generally a time-consuming ordeal not feasible for a visitor. As of 2024, the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra) remains the first and only jurisdiction to legalise personal use, but commercial sale is not allowed. In South Australia and Northern Territory, possession of personal use quantities is decriminalised, although on-the-spot fines still apply. In all other states possession remains a criminal offense, and foreigners should not expect more lenient treatment than locals from Australian police for drug offences. Driving while under the influence of drugs is a serious offence, and doing so will invariably lead to arrest and prosecution, and in serious cases even a jail sentence.\nDo not under any circumstances attempt to bring illicit drugs into Australia, including marijuana; this is strictly illegal and punishable with long jail terms of up to life in prison, and customs officers often employ dogs to sniff drugs out of arriving passengers' luggage. Dogs can even tell that you smoked marijuana from the day before you flew to Australia, so you may be held back for some long questioning.\nAustralia's proximity to Asia means that heroin is a far more commonly used illicit drug than cocaine or crack cocaine. In some areas of large cities you will need to be careful of discarded needles: however these will generally be found in back streets rather than in popular tourist spots.\n\n\nFirearms\nFirearm ownership is rare in Australia, with strict licensing requirements resulting in gun ownership being typically limited to hunters and farmers in rural areas, as well as sport shooters. Possession of any kind of firearm requires a licence, and semi-automatic assault rifles are prohibited for civilians. It is possible, albeit tedious, to import single-shot rifles, shotguns and pistols for target shooting with the correct paperwork. Criminal gangs sometimes carry illegal firearms in urban areas, although it is unlikely that travellers will run into them.\nIt is very difficult to bring firearms into Australia, with a police permit required for each federal state to be visited before arrival.\n\n\nLGBT travellers\nSee also: LGBT travel\nAustralia has an equal age of consent set at 16 for all states except Tasmania and South Australia where the age is 17. Same sex marriage is legal in Australia, having been passed into law in 2017 after a majority (61%) voted in favour of it in a national postal survey.\nAttitudes to homosexuality are similar to those found in other Western countries. Although inner Sydney is one of the most gay-friendly cities in the world, caution is still advisable in conservative rural areas, including rural parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. Australia has outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and legal recourse may be available should you experience discrimination. Police assistance for discrimination may be difficult to obtain in remote and rural areas, although homosexuality is accepted in most rural areas. Transgender people are, likewise, widely accepted.\nSydney is Australia's gay capital and hosts one of the world's most famous gay pride festivals \u2013 the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras \u2013 annually during February and March. The festival culminates in a huge parade through central Sydney which attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators. Alice Springs celebrates the \"Alice Is Wonderland Festival\", a gay and lesbian pride festival in late April/early May. Melbourne has the Midsumma festival every year on the first Sunday of February.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\n\nSkin\n\nExposure to the sun at Australian latitudes frequently results in sunburn, and Australia has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world. Getting sunburnt can make you feel feverish and unwell and may take a few days or weeks to heal depending on the severity. It means you can't go back out into the sun until the sunburn fades, so getting sunburnt on the first day of your beach holiday can seriously reduce the fun of your trip. It can take as little as 15 minutes to burn in Australia on a fine summer's day, even in shaded outdoor areas. You should wear sunscreen (SPF 50+), clothing, and a hat to shade the sun.\nRe-apply sunscreen every 2\u20133 hours throughout the day as it wears off quickly if you are sweating or swimming. Make sure to cover all parts of your body. UV radiation in the middle of the day can be double what it is in the early morning or later afternoon, so if possible avoid the sun during the hottest part of the day. Daily UV forecasts are issued by the Bureau of Meteorology online.\nSpray-on sunscreen from an aerosol bottle is popular because of its ease of use; however, it is far less effective than traditional sunscreen.\nIf you are heading to the beach, consider buying a sun-tent (less than $20 from discount and hardware stores). You generally can't hire beach umbrellas at Australian beaches, and they are very exposed.\n\n\nFood preparation\nAustralia has high hygiene standards, with restaurants required to observe strict food preparation standards. Food poisoning rates are comparable to other first world nations.\n\n\nWater\nThe tap water in urban Australia is always safe to drink. Occasionally you may encounter recycled water taps which are for watering plants and not drinking; these should be coloured purple. Public drinking fountains and bottle refill stations are common in cities and at tourist attractions. The taste and hardness of the tap water will vary considerably across the country. Some cities such as Adelaide rely on ground water supplies that have an unpleasant taste, but are perfectly safe. Many households use water purifier jugs. Bottled water is also widely available. Carrying water on hot days is a good idea in urban areas, and it is a necessity if hiking or driving out of town. Remoter areas in the outback may not have treated drinking water on tap. At sites where tap water is untreated, water sterilization tablets may be used as an alternative to boiling. If driving long distances on infrequently trafficked roads it is essential to carry drinking water. This is absolutely necessary in hotter areas and on dirt roads or tracks. It is rare that someone does not die of thirst in outback Australia in any year. It is recommended that in event of a breakdown you stay with the car for shade and to increase your chances of being found. Before long-distance touring seek specific advice on calculating how much water to carry for the proposed journey and allowing for breakdowns.\n\n\nVaccinations\nAustralia does not have endemic communicable diseases that will require non-standard vaccinations. Like many other countries, it will require evidence of yellow fever vaccinations on entry if you will have been in a country with a risk of infection within 6 days before your arrival in Australia.\n\n\nMosquitoes\nMosquitoes are present all year round in the tropics, and during the summer in southern areas. Screens on windows and doors are common, and repellent is readily available. Ross River Virus is spread by mosquitoes in the tropics, and can make you sick for a few weeks. There have been cases of dengue fever, for which no specific treatment exists. Malaria is not present in mainland Australia.\n\n\nMedical care\n\nAs described above, 000 is the Australian emergency services number and in any medical emergency you should call this number and ask for an ambulance and other emergency services as necessary, to attend.\nAustralia has first world medical standards. In particular, it is safe to receive blood transfusions in Australia, as donors are screened for HIV, hepatitis and many other blood borne illnesses.\nAustralia's population density is low; parts of Australia are a long way from medical facilities of any kind. Many of these areas are served by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Small towns with populations of 5,000 or more will have a small hospital capable of giving emergency treatment. Larger towns will have a base hospital capable of routine and some kinds of emergency surgery. In some cases you may need to be evacuated to one of the capital cities for specialist treatment.\nCapital cities will have medical centres where you can drop in, often open on weekends or until late. In country towns you may have to make an appointment and may have no alternative other than the closest hospital after hours and weekends. You can also expect to wait a few hours if your condition isn't urgent.\n\n Poisons Information Hotline, \u260f 13 11 26 (in country only). Give free advice if any medication or poisons are taken inadvertently. They will also give advice on what treatment is necessary for things like a spider bite. However, if you think you are in any immediate danger, call '000' for an ambulance. \n\n\nMedical costs and travel insurance\nAustralian citizens and permanent residents mostly use the taxpayer-funded Medicare system. Foreigners working or studying in Australia and without a reciprocal agreement are generally required to take up private health insurance as part of their visa conditions. Foreigners on a short visit will want to make sure their travel insurance is in order, as medical costs can be expensive for those not entitled to Medicare benefits. Medicare does not cover ambulances, private hospitals or dental care, so you will need to obtain private health insurance to pay for these.\nTravellers from Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom are entitled to free reciprocal Medicare treatment for emergency care at a hospital, and sometimes for other health problems that occur during their visit. It is advisable to familiarise yourself with the conditions of the reciprocal arrangement with your country. For example, Irish and New Zealand citizens are only entitled to free treatment at a hospital, whereas the other reciprocal nationalities are entitled to subsidised treatment at general practitioners as well. Reciprocal programs never cover private hospitals, so the full cost of these services will have to be met by yourself or with travel insurance.\nIf you are not a citizen or permanent resident of a reciprocal agreement country then travel insurance is highly recommended.\nYou can expect to pay around $80 to see a general practitioner, plus additional costs for any pathology or medical imaging required. The charge to visit a local hospital can be much more expensive, private hospitals even more so. You can pay up to $500 even if you are not admitted, and upwards of $1000 if you are. Rescue and Royal Flying Doctor Services are free and taxpayer-funded, but evacuation or ambulance services can cost many thousands of dollars from a country town to a capital city, or from an island to the mainland.\nEven if you are an Australian citizen, ambulance and evacuation services are not provided free of charge. If an air-ambulance is required this can still cost thousands of dollars. Most health-insurance companies sell ambulance only cover valid Australia-wide. Ambulance membership programs may only cover you in your own state - check before travelling interstate. Domestic travel insurance does not usually cover medical or ambulance expenses. Medicare cover does not include ambulance costs (starting at $1000) in the event of an emergency; only private insurance with ambulance cover will pay for this.\nSnake and spider bite anti-venom is very expensive. The cost can be well over $10,000 even if you don't need a stay in hospital.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nTelephone\n\n\nCalling overseas from Australia\nThe main international access code or prefix is 0011 (when using a mobile phone the plus symbol \"+\" can be used instead of the 0011 prefix).\n\n\nDialling codes\nThe country code for international calls to Australia is +61. When dialling from overseas, omit any leading '0' in the area code. The area code is optional when calling from the same area code area.\nNorfolk Island and Australian-Antarctic bases use the +672 code, not Australia's country code. See the specific articles.\nAustralian area code list:\n\n02 = Central East (New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and north-eastern fringe of Victoria)\n03 = South East (Southern NSW, Victoria and Tasmania)\n04 = Mobile phones Australia-wide (higher call charges apply)\n07 = North East (Queensland and parts of Northern NSW)\n08 = Central & West (Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western New South Wales)\nLocal calls are free of charge.\n\nIf calling an Australian number from outside Australia, use the format +61880803300 (no \"0\" area code prefix; substitute the relevant international dialling prefix for the \"+\" if needed).\nIf making an international call from within Australia dial the international dialling prefix or \"+\", followed by the country code, followed by destination area code, followed by the local number at the destination. For most countries you need to omit the area code prefix (usually \"0\" as in Australia).\nFor example, the local number for the Moree tourist information is 6757-3350. The area code is 02 as Moree is in the Central East area code region. To dial the number from Sydney or anywhere else inside the same area code, just dial 6757-3350. To dial the number from Brisbane or anywhere in Australia outside the area code region, you will need to dial 02 6757-3350. If you don't know your area code region, you can include the area code, and it will work regardless of from where you are calling. To dial the number from overseas you will need to dial +61 2 6757-3350.\n\n\nSpecial numbers\nNumbers commencing with 13 are charged at a local call rate, and what they connect you to can vary according to your location. They can be 10 or 6 digit numbers. For example, 1300 796 222, will connect you with the Albury tourist information, no matter where you are in Australia. However, 131 008 will connect you with a different local taxi service depending on where you are. 13 22 32 will connect you to New South Wales Railways in Sydney or Victorian Railways in Melbourne. Calling these numbers internationally can be problematic.\nNumbers commencing with 18 are free when dialled from a payphone or fixed phone, and commonly used for hotel reservation numbers, or tourist information numbers.\nNumbers commencing with 19 are premium numbers, often with very hefty call charges (make sure you check before dialling).\nNumbers commencing with 12 are carrier services, and are dependent on what network you are connected to. For example, 12 456 is a general information number for Telstra. Vodafone offer a similar services on 123. These numbers can be premium services as well.\nCalling special numbers internationally can often work - just try dialling the number prefixed with the +61 country code. Many locations will give an alternative direct number for use in international dialling.\nMaking reverse charge (collect) calls is very expensive and can be problematic. You can use 12550 from a Telstra public phone, or 1800 NO CASH from any phone. But you have to be calling a number that will accept the charges (usually a landline or mobile on a mainstream telco).\n\n\nMobile phones\n\nAustralia has three mobile networks operated by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, with numerous resellers for each.  All three operate LTE (4G) and 5G networks; 3G is being phased out and will stop working by the end of 2024.  Generally speaking, Telstra provides the best coverage, but is the most expensive, while Vodafone often does not have coverage in rural towns, but is the cheapest.  Unpopulated or sparsely populated areas away from major roads are unlikely to have service at all. If you are heading way out into the bush then a satellite phone may be your only option. Remember all mobile phones can be used for emergency calls on all networks, even if they don't have a local SIM or aren't roaming. This applies to satellite phones too.\nWith foreign SIM cards, international roaming is generally seamless onto Australia's 4G networks, depending on agreements between operators. 5G networks are different with frequencies and can vary with the compatibility of your phone. Check with your home operator before you leave.  There are no restrictions on overseas residents obtaining Australian prepaid SIM cards, although you may require some form of photo ID such as your passport for identification.\nA cheap prepaid mobile phone with a SIM retails for around $40 in most Australian retail outlets, supermarkets, and post offices; a SIM alone for an existing phone is around $2\u20133. Prepaid credit is added using recharge cards available at all supermarkets, newsagents, some ATMs, and other outlets.\nYou can buy a seemly infinite variety of packages, SIM cards, and phone bundles, with varied combinations of data, SMS and call time. Some carriers make calculating included calls difficult, by giving you a dollar \"value\" that is included in your package, and you then need to find the call, sms and data rates to calculate what is included. These rates can differ from plan to plan. Make sure the plan you choose includes what you need, because using data or making calls outside of the package allowance is often orders of magnitude more expensive.\nThe 3G shutdown will impact whether you're able to use your current phone to Australia: it needs to support Voice over LTE, the manufacturer needs to have loaded configuration files for at least one Australian network operator, the phone needs to also support emergency calls over LTO, and the service provider needs to recognise it as a compatible device. Whether or not the model is sold in Australia does not guarantee compatibility, as there can be minor differences based on the region it was exported to. As of October 2024, it is unclear how this will affect roaming (i.e. bringing a SIM from your home country -- whether the device still needs to be fully compatible). You may be able to purchase a data-only plan, which would allow you to receive SMS (but not send) and access the internet, without the ability to make or receive phone calls, but that has not yet been confirmed. You may have to buy a phone when you arrive. Wifi is not affected, and you may be able to just use free wifi if you're in towns.\n\n\nSatellite phones\n\nIf you need comprehensive coverage in rural and remote areas, you can use a satellite phone. Iridium, Globalstar and Thuraya satellite services are available in Australia. Expect to pay around $120 per week to hire a satellite phone, plus call costs. Satellite messaging units, which send your location and a help SMS or email, can be hired for around $80 per week.\nThese units are only available from specialist dealers, often only in major cities (away from the remote areas you may be visiting). You should be able to acquire or hire these units in your home country before departure if you wish.\nSatellite phones can be used to make emergency calls without a SIM card or subscription plan. The cheapest cost around $300, or just a little more than a PLB.\n\n\nPublic phones\nMost towns and suburbs have at least one public phone. Most railway stations will have a public phone. All public phones in Australia are free for local calls to landlines and mobiles. International calls may be made using Telstra or third-party calling cards available from newsagents. Free text messages can be sent from any Telstra public phone, using the keypad in much the same way as an old-style mobile phone. Follow the instructions on the phone display.\n\n\nWifi\nVirtually all accommodations in Australia from youth hostel and caravan park to 5-star hotel have free wifi, as do most cafes, shopping malls and even some forms of public transport like trains and ferries.  If you need to borrow a full-fledged PC to go online, public libraries are usually your best bet.  Internet cafes are virtually obsolete, although you can still find gaming cafes here and there.\nIn major urban centres, you'll find free Wi-Fi in shopping malls and other large shops and increasingly on public transport: Sydney's ferries offer free Wi-Fi as do Adelaide's trams.\n\n\nRadio and television\nAustralia has 2 national public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (or ABC) broadcasts Local Radio, Triple J (Youth/Indie music) and ABC Classic on AM/FM Radio as well as 5 TV channels. The Special Broadcasting Service (or SBS) broadcasts more ethnic, bilingual and cultural content on 6 TV channels and 2 analog radio stations. Both broadcasters are available in most populous areas but the ABC has a greater radio coverage.  DAB+ Digital Radio is available in capital cities.\nThere are 3 free-to-air commercial TV networks, namely Seven, Nine and Ten. You should expect to be able to receive and watch all these channels in almost all accommodation in towns and cities across Australia.  The cable TV monopoly used to be Foxtel, still advertised by many hotels, but these days Netflix and its local competitors Stan and Kayo Sports rule the roost.\nThe bigger the city, the more radio stations you'll find. Country towns will often just have one commercial radio station and the ABC. If you're driving the distances between country towns, you can often lose all radio coverage. Download some music or podcasts for the trip before you leave. It's advisable to stay tuned to the ABC if travelling during emergencies or high bushfire risk periods.\n\n\nNews\nThe main national broadsheet newspaper is The Australian, with The Australian Financial Review focussing on financial and business news. There are also other newspapers that are published locally within their respective states, the most notable ones being The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph, both based in Sydney, and The Age and Herald Sun, both based in Melbourne.\n\n\nPost\n\nAustralia Post runs Australia's postal service. Letters can be posted in any red Australia Post posting box, which are found at all post offices and many other locations. All stamps can be purchased from post offices, and some stamps can be purchased from newsagents and hotels. Posting a standard letter or postcard costs $1.10 within Australia (up to 250g), and between $2.50 and $3.70 internationally (up to 20g). Sending international letters up to 50g is cheaper in November and December, at $2.40, but the letter must have \"card only\" written on the front.
