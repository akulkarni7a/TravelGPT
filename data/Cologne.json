  "extract": "Cologne (German: K\u00f6ln, Ripuarian: K\u00f6lle) is a city on the Rhine river in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is the fourth largest city in Germany with around 1.1 million residents (2020). It is one of the nation's media, tourism and business hotspots, and is considered one of the most liberal cities in Germany.\nCologne has a rich history, reaching back to the time of the ancient Roman Empire, when it was founded. It has remained a constantly inhabited important regional centre since. Compared to other German and European cities, the ancient and medieval Cologne was relatively large, covering most of the modern-day city centre. A wealth of architectural heritage can therefore be found across the city ranging from pre-Christian times to strikingly modern buildings, with a high concentration of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, culminating in the magnificent cathedral (Dom).\nCologne is, however, not only a tourist destination, but on an equal note a major economic centre, a globally important trade fair location, a culture and media hotspot and a major transportation hub. This equal mix of roles and functions is permeable throughout the city and provides it with a constant inflow of various visitors, as well as a very diverse population mix. This all culminates during the traditional Karneval, and makes Cologne one of the most-visited destinations in Germany.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nOrientation\n\nCologne lies on both sides of the river Rhine, which flows through it in a northerly direction. The left hand, or western side, is Cologne proper with the Old Town (Altstadt), the famous cathedral and most landmarks and museums. The right side, or eastern side, used to be a separate town called Deutz - now Deutz is a neighbourhood of Cologne.\nCologne is divided into 9 districts (Stadtbezirke), numbered from 1 to 9. Stadtbezirk 1, called Innenstadt (\"inner city\"), is probably the one most tourists will spend all of their time in, as it contains most of the city's points of interest. It is also the only district that lies on both sides of the Rhine, as it includes Deutz. Districts 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are on the western bank of the Rhine, and districts 7, 8 and 9 on the eastern bank, surrounding the Innenstadt.\n\nEvery Stadtbezirk is further divided into Stadtteile (literally \"city parts\", or \"neighbourhoods\"). The Innenstadt includes Altstadt-Nord and Alstadt-S\u00fcd, two parts of the historic Old Town of Cologne facing the Rhine, divided by the L111 thoroughfare running from east to west (with the street names C\u00e4cilienstra\u00dfe \u2013 Neumarkt \u2013 Hahnenstra\u00dfe), starting at the Deutzer Br\u00fccke (bridge over the Rhine). The Altstadt is surrounded by a ring of wide avenues running over the former city walls of Cologne. They all have street names ending with the word Ring.\nThe part of Innenstadt lying on the outer side of the ring is the Neustadt, or \"new town\". Neustadt is further divided into Neustadt-Nord and Neustadt-Sued, also separated by L111 (Aachener Stra\u00dfe). Both parts of the Neustadt form a crescent embracing the Altstadt and reaching the Rhine on either side thereof. Finally, facing the Altstadt and Neustadt on the other (eastern) side of the Rhine is the Stadtteil of Deutz, which completes the Innenstadt.\n\n\nHistory\nCologne is one of the oldest cities in Germany, having been founded and established in the 1st century AD, as the Roman Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium. \"Cologne\" is the French version of the city's name, which has become standard in English as well. It has a traditional, strong rivalry with the neighbouring city of D\u00fcsseldorf, the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia, although this is mostly manifested by a number of jocular references made to one another in both cities and constant bickering as to whose local beer is best (in Cologne, it is obviously K\u00f6lsch). It was Germany's largest city at several points in history and for most of the Middle Ages it was the only place that would even register as a major city population-wise by modern standards. Today it is the fourth biggest city in Germany (after Berlin, Hamburg and Munich) and the biggest that is neither city state nor state capital. \n\n\nClimate\nThe climate of North Western Germany is changeable, with seasonal changes and day-to-day weather often comparable to that of England or Northern France. Travellers to Cologne can expect the hottest time of the year to be late July/early August, the coldest is January (temperature hovering around the freezing mark) and the month with the most rainfall is June.\n\n\nTourist office\nK\u00f6ln Tourism website\n1 K\u00f6lnTourismus, Kardinal-Hoeffner-Platz 1 (directly opposite the front entrance of the cathedral, take the U-Bahn to Dom/Hbf), \u260f +49 221 346430. M-Sa 09:00-19:00, Sundays closed. The Cologne Tourist Office offers a wealth of information for the traveller who wishes to fill their itinerary with activities around the city. Ask about guide books that are available, most of which provide information for free. (updated Jun 2023)\n\n\nTalk\nThe distinctive flavour to the city of Cologne is often linked to the city's inhabitants, or K\u00f6lsche, who take an enormous amount of pride in their city. Cologne is a traditionally Ripuarian-speaking city, though this has mostly been replaced by standard German, which is now the main language of the city. English-speaking guides and information are available for many of the landmarks of the city. For tourists who speak German and wish to practice it, the citizens usually have a lot of patience with those trying to come to grips with the language. Cologne's citizens are very friendly and jovial people, welcoming tourists of all types and with all interests.\nGerman is of course the language of this city but it is very easy to find information in French and English, also sometimes in Spanish and Japanese. Due to a large number of immigrants, Persian, Turkish, Polish and Russian are also widely spoken. Announcements in the main train station (Hauptbahnhof) are in German, French and English. Like many German cities and areas, Cologne also has a local dialect, called K\u00f6lsch, however all speakers will also be familiar with German.\nAway from the landmarks, workers of the Deutsche Bahn (German railways) often speak English reasonably well, and ticket machines have a language selection feature. In general, older people in Cologne tend to have little or no knowledge of English, while younger Germans and those working in the business world tend to be more proficient. Language is rarely a strong barrier, so this should not be much of a worry for the average tourist. Just approach a friendly native with a smile on your face.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Cologne Bonn Airport (CGN  IATA). This airport handles international and domestic flights and is a hub for the low-cost Lufthansa subsidiary Eurowings.   (updated May 2019)\nGetting there:\nThe airport is approximately 15 minutes to the centre of Cologne by commuter train S19 (towards D\u00fcren), RB 27 (M\u00f6nchengladbach) or RE 6 (RRX; Minden). The fare (ticket zone 1b) is \u20ac3 one-way (May 2022).\nTo the district Porz get bus line 161 which departs every 30 \u2013 60 min from 04:59 to 23:30. Travel time is 15 min and costs \u20ac3 (May 2022).\nD\u00fcsseldorf Airport (DUS IATA), The D\u00fcsseldorf airport offers many intercontinental connections. A train ride from the airport train station to Cologne central station takes about 40 minutes. IC and ICE trains on this route cost \u20ac16-\u20ac23, but offer no real time savings over the humble Regional Express (RE) trains, which require only a regional transit ticket (Price zone / Preisstufe 5; \u20ac11.90 as of May 2022).  The Deutsche Bahn journey planner will show you your options.\nFrankfurt Airport (FRA IATA), is the largest airport in Germany, served by all major international airlines. ICE (InterCityExpress) high speed trains connect Frankfurt Airport and Cologne central station in less than one hour. Standard one-way fare is \u20ac67 by ICE. However there are many reduced fares available if you order in advance with prices starting as low as \u20ac19. If you pay full price you do not have to take a specific train, but discounted tickets are restricted to the train on your reservation. Trains via Koblenz, which use the slower, yet extremely scenic route along the Rhine Valley, are also 30% cheaper. The ICE train takes about one hour, the slower more scenic route takes about two hours. There are also intercity buses, for example Flixbus, which go from the Frankfurt airport to Cologne airport.\n\n\nBy train\n\nCologne is served by two major train stations:\n\n2 K\u00f6ln Hauptbahnhof (QKL  IATA).    and\n3 K\u00f6ln Messe/Deutz, Ottoplatz 7, 50679 K\u00f6ln.   \nCologne is linked with Amsterdam, Brussels, and Paris by Eurostar (formally Thalys) and ICE (high speed trains). \nNightjet, the Austrian Railways' sleeper train, runs twice a week from Brussels via Aachen and Cologne to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck. It calls at Bonn, Koblenz, Frankfurt airport, W\u00fcrzburg and Nuremberg where it divides: One portion runs via Linz to Vienna, the other via Munich to Innsbruck.\nThe Frankfurt airport (FRA IATA) has direct service to Cologne and is within one hour by ICE trains.\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: Intercity buses in Germany\n4 Intercity bus station Cologne Airport. \n5 Intercity bus station Leverkusen Mitte. \nLong-distance buses cannot stop in the centre of Cologne. The main long-distance bus stations serving Cologne are at the train station Leverkusen Mitte (20 minutes by S-Bahn from/to Cologne Hauptbahnhof, check if you need to pay a fare on top of your long-distance bus ticket) and at K\u00f6ln Bonn Airport. You can compare travel time and costs for various modes of transport on various websites.\n\n\nBy car\nCologne requires all cars to have a \"Low Emissions\" sticker in order to drive around in the city centre Low Emission Zone (\"Umweltzone\"). Information on obtaining a sticker (which must be done at least several weeks in advance) is available here. There are very few exceptions and even electric cars or foreign cars have to get the sticker.\nAutobahns A1, A4, A3, A57, and A555 lead to Cologne. During rush hour the streets are heavily congested, also due to massive construction of a new subway tunnel Nord-S\u00fcd Stadtbahn, crossing half the city centre.\nFor cheap parking, with quick connections to central Cologne, use park and ride (\"park und ride\"). At some stations, parking is free when you present a validated transit ticket on exit.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy public transport\n\nCologne has an excellent public transport network consisting of trams, local trains and buses. Bicycles are also available for hire on the northern side of the Hauptbahnhof. Local transport systems rarely provide announcements in English, but network maps are commonly available to assist with your journey. Those wishing to explore areas away from the central city should plan their journey and potential connections before leaving. The KVB (K\u00f6lner Verkehrs-Betriebe) website is a good source of public transport information.\n\nTickets are valid for subway, tram and regional train within the VRS-network. Trips within the city limits require zone 1b tickets (2019: single \u20ac3, 4-trip-ticket \u20ac12, day ticket \u20ac8.80, day ticket for up to 5 people \u20ac13.40), week ticket \u20ac26.30. For short trips of up to 4 stops on subway, tram or bus there is also the slightly cheaper \"Kurzstrecke\" (short trip ticket, 2019: \u20ac2.00). They offer mobile app (iOS, Android), which allows buying tickets with 10% discount. A map of the network can be found at most stops, inside all vehicles (check ceilings, back entrances) and online.\nCologne's subway and tram-system, or U-Bahn, is a mixture of systems: a subway line can go on street-level and end up as a tram or vice versa. There are vending machines or ticket-offices at larger stations The trains and buses also have vending-machines. See the public bus, tram and subway-company KVB for printable maps of the bus/tram/subway system and here for their official street map (also found here) of Cologne.\nRegional trains are known as \"S-Bahn\", \"Regional-Bahn\" and \"Regional Express\". Most of them don't have ticket vending-machines so remember to buy a ticket at the station.\nStudent travel: Student travel (age 20 or less) can be very cheap to and from Cologne, as well as around the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia. The German rail company (DB: Deutsche Bahn) offer a 'Sch\u00f6neFerienTicket NRW' during student holiday times and allows free travel throughout North Rhine-Westphalia on local buses, trams, U-Bahn, S-Bahn and regional trains. Prices range from around \u20ac54 for summer holidays to \u20ac25.50 for Easter holidays, but prices and times change from year to year.\nThese tickets are available to anyone with valid student identification (student union card, enrolment card, etc.) and personal identification (passport, driving licence, etc.) The ticket is only valid for the student holiday dates of North Rhine-Westphalia and the ticket is not valid for high speed express trains. Visit/contact Deutsche Bahn for more information before travelling to Germany.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nCologne has, like e.g. Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt, app-based bike rental systems such as Call A Bike and KVB-Rad (run by Nextbike). After you register for an account on-line, you will be charged time-based fees. \nThe Radstation at the central train station offers rentals from 3 hours on, with discounts for longer rentals (a cash deposit of \u20ac50 is required). Going by bike is maybe the best way to go around in the city.\n\n\nOn foot\nBut, on the whole, the centre of Cologne is not that big for a city of one million. It is entirely feasible to walk from one end of the centre, say, the Rudolfplatz, to the other end, say, the Cathedral, in half an hour.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nUber, Bolt and Free Now cover the city.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nHistorical attractions\n1 K\u00f6lner Dom (Cathedral) (U-Bahn: Dom / Hbf). M-Sa 06:00-19:30 (May-Oct: 06:00-21:00), Su 13:00-16:30. A UNESCO World Heritage site. It took over 630 years to complete this monumental cathedral. In 1880 the cathedral was finally consecrated. Cologne's Dom is the first sight you will notice when taking the main exit from the central station. (If you don't see it, you've taken the back exit.) If you are in good shape, take the 509 stairs to the top of the south tower. It takes about an hour, so wear comfortable shoes, but it's worth the hike. Touring the cathedral is forbidden during Mass. Entry into the cathedral is free but you will be asked for a donation. Admission to the tower costs: \u20ac5, reduced: \u20ac2, family: \u20ac8. Admission to the treasury costs: \u20ac6, reduced: \u20ac4, family: \u20ac12. However, a combined ticket granting you admission to the treasury and tower can be purchased for (regular/reduced/family): \u20ac8/\u20ac4/\u20ac16. No luggage may be carried inside.   (updated May 2019)\n\n12 Romanesque Churches - Between 1150 and 1250, numerous churches were built in the Romanesque style.\n2 Basilica of St. Cunibert (St. Kunibert's Church). Wonderful stained glass windows.   \n3 Basilica of St. Severin, Im Ferkelum 29 (Tram Clodwigplatz). The oldest Christian foundation in Cologne.   \n4 St. Maria Lyskirchen.   \n5 St. Andrew's Church (St. Andreas).   \n6 Basilica of the Holy Apostles (St. Aposteln).   \n7 St. Gereon's Basilica, Gereonsdriesch 2.

The synagogue is notable for its architecture that looks, well, right out of Gotham City. The Torah within the synagogue was rescued by a Catholic priest from another synagogue as it was being burned during Nazi rule. In August 2005 Pope Benedict XVI visited the synagogue; he was the second pope to ever visit a synagogue.   \n\n15 Historisches Rathaus (Historic Town Hall/Cologne City Hall) (U-Bahn Rathaus).   \n16 Praetorium. An accessible archaeological site with the ruins of the ancient Roman Praetorium of Colonia.  \n17 G\u00fcrzenich dance hall (U-Bahn/Tram Heumarkt).

There are also historical monuments, such as the North City Gate or Eigelsteintorburg in the Agnesviertel, very near to Fort X, built to protect the city from French attacks, and Agneskirche, a late neo-gothic church on the boulevardesque Neusserstra\u00dfe. Neusserstra\u00dfe also has a yoga school, an Aikido school, a Japanese restaurant, a well-stocked bookshop, and a range of pubs. Nearby you will find the Alte Feuerwache, where there are regular exhibitions on political topics and a surreal flea market every four weeks in summer. Opposite Alte Feuerwache is the Artclub, with regular exhibitions of contemporary art, and on Ebertplatz there is a cinema (Metropolis) which shows films in the original (mostly English, but sometimes also French or Spanish). On nearby L\u00fcbecker Stra\u00dfe, you will find the uncompromisingly Arty Filmpalette cinema. To round off a trip to the Agnesviertel, you might like a k\u00f6lsch in the Lapidarium (right beside the North City Gate) or a coffee in Cafe Schmitz, Cologne's grooviest poser hangout (they also do a great breakfast.) All of these great places are within a short walk of Ebertplatz U-Bahn.\nEigelstein \u2013 around the Eigelsteintorburg, U-Bahn \"Ebertplatz\"\nMartinsviertel / Altstadt \u2013 Old town between Rhine, Heumarkt, Alter Markt and Dom, (Cologne Cathedral), U-Bahn \"Rathaus\" or \"Heumarkt\"\nSeverinsviertel and S\u00fcdstadt \u2013 around the Severinstorburg, U-Bahn \"Clodwigplatz\"\nKwartier Lat\u00e4ng \u2013 This student neighbourhood takes it name from the Parisian Quartier Latin. It is centred on the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe and provides ample nightlife opportunities, ranging from a night shop with dancefloor and toilets (Sp\u00e4ti), to grimy indie bars. Middle Eastern food is also easy to be found here, including the famous and very popular Habibi. The neighbourhood can be accessed by going to the station \"Z\u00fclpicher Platz\".\nBelgisches Viertel \u2013 Stadtbahn \"Moltkestra\u00dfe\"\nEhrenfeld \u2013 U-Bahn \"K\u00f6rnerstra\u00dfe\"\n\n\nOther attractions\n27 Hohenzollern Bridge. Also called the Locking Bridge. If you walk to the back of the K\u00f6lner Dom along a straight path, there is a bridge on the Rhine to your right that is covered in padlocks. The locks are placed there by couples to show their loyalty to each other. Couples often have their names and a significant date inscribed on the locks. There are other places around the world that have \"love padlocks\".   \n\n28 Rheinauhafen. This completely rebuilt area combines modern extravagant architecture with historical harbour buildings. The old Rheinauhafen opened in 1898 and became necessary due to increasing amount of freight traffic. The new Rheinauhafen is a mix of office buildings and apartment buildings and gastronomy. On a peninsula of the Rhine (1 km southern of Heumarkt) it is an invitation for a beautiful walk along the river or for having lunch or dinner. Also see the separate itinerary article for a walking tour.   \n\nParks: Cologne has two park areas (Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel) encircling the city (immediately outside the medieval city limits) and nearly the entire town, respectively, which were set aside as public recreation areas after World War I. The inner Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel is probably more easy to reach for tourists who only stay a few days. Most notably are Volksgarten, Rheinpark, Hiroshima-Nagasaki- (colloquially known as Aachener-Weiher-) and Stadtgarten parks where thousands of people come together to enjoy the sun, play and barbecue when the weather is fine. All these parks have an associated beer garden. Dispose any packaging, charcoal, etc., into the waste bins (which are few and far between), as the city has begun to employ anti-littering patrols that will levy a stiff fine on anyone seen littering. Metro: Eifelplatz for Volksgarten, Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe for Hiroshima-Nagasaki-Park, Hans-B\u00f6ckler-Platz/Bahnhof West for Stadtgarten, Bahnhof Deutz for Rheinpark.\n\n29 Flora and Botanical Garden, Alter Stammheimer Weg (Near Zoo, Tram Zoo/Flora), \u260f +49 221-560890, botanischer-garten@stadt-koeln.de. 8:00-sunset.

As well as world class museums of art and archaeology, Cologne boasts two museums of ecclesiastical art, both housed in architecturally stunning buildings. There is also an ethnographic museum, a chocolate museum, the German Sport Museum and an abundance of Roman remains.\nOne can purchase a MuseumsCard from one of the municipal museums (such as the first five listed below). The single card costs \u20ac18, the family card, which costs \u20ac30, entitles 2 adults and 2 children (under 18) free admission to each of the municipal museums during two consecutive opening days.

(updated Jun 2019)\n\n\nS\u00fcdstadt\n43 Overstolzenhaus. One of the oldest houses in Cologne, built between 1220 and 1225, with an impressive romaneque fa\u00e7ade. Built as a residence for a local patrician, today it houses the Academy of Media Arts. \n44 Kunsthaus Lempertz. The famous German art merchants and auctioneers, founded in 1845 (although the building is from 1952, reconstructed after the Second World War). \n45 Postamt (B\u00fcrgerhaus Stollwerck), Dreik\u00f6nigenstra\u00dfe 23. The former post office built from red brick in 1906 is now used as a theatre. \n46 Wasserturm. The former water tower built in 1868-1872 is now used as a luxury boutique hotel. The 11th floor (at 35 metres) houses a terrace and glass covered dining/meeting room, which can be rented out for private functions. \n47 Wolkenburg. The baroque estate was built in 1734 for a benedictine convent, but is used today by the 190-man choir K\u00f6lner M\u00e4nner-Gesang-Verein C\u00e4cilia Wolkenburg. It is also an event centre. \n48 Severinsbr\u00fccke. Completed in 1959, the cable-stayed bridge provided a relief for the Deutzer Br\u00fccke. Although not outstanding visually as such, it provides a nice view of both banks of the Rhine if you care to walk it. \n\n\nChurches and other religious buildings\n49 Kart\u00e4userkirche (Charterhouse church). The church belonged to the local charterhouse (a monastery of the Carthusian order) until 1794, when the monastery was closed and the church was used variously as a warehouse or a military hospital until the 1920s, when it was restored to its religious function by a local protestant community, whom it serves as a church until today. After reconstruction, it features an impressive pipe organ array with glockenspiel. \n50 Dreik\u00f6nigenpf\u00f6rtchen. One of the best-hidden gems of Cologne, the small yet ornate gothic gate once led to an \"immunity\" belonging to the convent based at the St. Maria im Kapitol. \n51 St. Gregorius im Elend. Neobaroque church from the early 19th century. \n52 St. Johann Baptist. This Catholic church is one of the oldest in Cologne, predating even the famous romanesque churches, as it was founded in 948. It has seen many additions and reconstructions throughout the centuries, and was almost totally destroyed during the Second World War. Its current form is an eclectic reconstruction finished in the early 1960s. \n53 Former franciscan convent with St. Marien church. Nestled inconspicuously between contemporary residential buildings is this impressive complex with gothic-inspired decorations \n54 St. Peter church, Leonhard-Tietz-Stra\u00dfe 6.

This 19th-century evangelical church provides both regular religious services and serves as a venue for various cultural, especially musical, events. \n\n\nDeutz\nDominated by two very utilitarian land uses, the fairgrounds in the north and the actually functional freight harbour of Cologne in the south, Deutz is not without long history and much heritage and charm in its built environment as well. While the left Rhine bank is clearly the dominant one in Cologne, Deutz is where you can get the best views of it across the Rhine, and this is a reason alone to cross the river and get there, but by far not the only one.\n\n57 K\u00f6ln-Triangle (LVR-Turm), Ottoplatz 1, \u260f +49 2234 9921-555, info@kulturinfo-rheinland.de.

The K\u00f6ln-Triangle is a high rise building in Deutz, immediately by the waterfront. It is a part of a building complex fronted by the Rhine-facing Hyatt hotel and is hard to miss due to its prominence and quite easily accessible from both Deutz and the left bank of the Rhine (simply cross the Hochenzollern bridge from the Altstadt). On its 29th floor, it has a viewing terrace called Panorama, which is publicly accessible via a lift for a relatively reasonable fee. The terrace has glass all around it for both safety purposes and for exhibiting the names of various landmarks you can see from it. If you want to take really good photos, you may want to have a piece of cloth with you to clean the glass of fingerprints and such. The viewing terrace is closed during bad weather (like storm or hail). Admission is \u20ac3 for a single person, every additional member of the same party pays \u20ac2 only. \n\n58 Tanzbrunnen. \n59 Rheinpark. \n60 Alt St. Heribert. \n61 Neu St. Heribert. \n62 Jewish Cemetery. \n63 maxCologne. \n64 Lanxess Arena. \n65 Koelnmesse (southern entrance marked on the map - exit from the Koeln Deutz/Messe railway station in the direction of the Messe and follow the signs). \n66 Rheinhallen. \n67 Messeturm K\u00f6ln. \n68 Bahnhof K\u00f6ln-Deutz. The historic building of the station now known as K\u00f6ln Messe/Deutz is an interesting piece of architectural heritage many visitors to Cologne miss as they exit the station on the fairgrounds side. \n69 St. Johannes church. \n70 D\u00fcxer Bock. \n71 Cuirassier Monument. \n72 Deutzer Drehbr\u00fccke. \n73 ESSO Station An der K\u00f6lnarena. You may wonder what's so special about a gas station, but you will understand once you see its 1950s architecture with the unique structured roof and learn that it is the oldest gas station in Cologne in continuous operation. \n74 Deutzer Freiheit.

On Rosenmontag (Shrove Monday) more than one and a half million people line Cologne's streets to watch the parade with the mad triad \u2013 the prince, farmer, and virgin \u2013 every year.\"  (date needs fixing)\n\n\nTours\n KD Rhine River Cruise, Frankenwerft 35, \u260f +49 221 208 83 18.

This non-profit organization offers excellent tours of Cologne, led by volunteers. The prices are moderate and there is a huge list of tours, including (besides the more regular tours) Koelsch tours (for testing the breweries) or language lessons in the local dialect (again, in a brewery). Ask for English tours, some guides are willing to conduct a normally German tour in English. \n Rickshaws: environmentally friendly city tours. Rickshaws are exotic and environmentally friendly tricycles, that bring their passengers slowly and safely to their destination. By Rickshaw you will discover Cologne\u2019s points of interest in a comfortable way. \n\n\nSpa and massage\nBeauty and spa treatments are popular in Cologne.\nIn typical German style, all sauna areas (referred to as Saunalandschaften, i.e. Sauna landscapes) are mixed (apart from the odd Damentag) and that bathing costumes are banned from them for hygienic reasons. Yup. Starkers, everybody.\nDo take a bathrobe (to keep you from the cold outside the saunas) and a large towel (to put under you in the saunas, no sweating on the wood, please) with you, though.\nDo not draw hasty conclusions either: mixed nudity does not make those places dens of sin, quite the contrary. Nudity is considered as the only appropriate outfit in saunas, and it all happens in a disciplined, wholesome, safe and respectful atmosphere. Possibly one of the highest forms of German civilisation one can experience.\nGawkers and bathing costume-wearers will be expelled by the staff without qualms, so don't even think you can get away with playing the tourist who didn't know, it won't make a difference.\nThat very matter-of factly, unerotic approach to mixed nudity may well turn out to be a revelation to many visitors open-minded enough to give it a try and go with the flow.\nSauna:\n\n Claudius Therme. Large spa with pool and lots of different saunas (indoors and outdoors) next to the Rhine, north of Deutz. \n Mauritius Therme. Decent Saunalanschaft in a hotel south of Neumarkt. \n Mediterana. 11 saunas and a huge pool, in Bergisch Gladbach, East of Cologne. \n monte mare Bedburg, \u260f +49 2272 906800.

Also a comprehensive fitness centre. \n Saunas in public swimming pools. Some of the public swimming pools managed by the Cologne city council, notably Agrippabad, do have small Saunalandschaften too, all featuring a Damentag (ladies only day). \nMassage:\n\n Ananda Tantra Massage and Coaching, Frankfurter Str. 40, \u260f +49 221 6086585. Daily 09:00-21:00. Tantra massage, coaching and workshops, an open minded and liberal attitude essential because the massages include sexually sensitive body parts, however, no sexual services are given by the team of 30 female and male employees. (updated Aug 2018)\n Sukon - Thai Art Of Massage. Traditional Thai massage institute, in the city centre. Thai native massage therapists practise in the 160-m\u00b2 Thai-styled studio: original royal massage, aroma oil massage and foot massage. This place does not offer any erotic massages. \n\n\nBuy\nThe main shopping street of Cologne is the Schildergasse, extending from the Neumarkt. The Schildergasse, Neumarkt, and pedestrianized side streets extending from them (in particular the Hohe Stra\u00dfe leading towards the Dom) host department stores, boutiques and other high-profile (and, often, high-price) retail establishments. For young fashion, also try Ehrenstra\u00dfe.\n\n\nDepartment stores\n1 Galeria Kaufhof. Germany's largest department store chain and direct descendant of the mighty Leonhard Tietz AG has its flagship store in Cologne, where it is headquartered (although the headquarter offices have now moved to a different, modern building in Altstadt-Sued). The original 19th-century Tietz department store on the Schildergasse has been expanded with a \"modern\" part in the 1950s, including a multi-storey parking, facing the Caecilienstra\u00dfe and now fills the entire huge block. You can find everything there, from apparel to groceries. (updated Jul 2017)\n2 Karstadt. Kaufhof's main competitor situated themselves in a modern shopping centre north of Neumarkt, over the Zeppelinstra\u00dfe. \n\n\nHigh-end fashion\nAlthough it is Duesseldorf that brands itself as the German capital of fashion, Cologne's Altstadt also features a wide range of high-end fashion stores with a selection of top German and global brands.\n\n3 Franz Sauer, Minoritenstra\u00dfe 13. \n4 Apropos, Mittelstra\u00dfe 3. Features a Gucci brand store. \n5 La Belle Modehaus, Mittelstra\u00dfe 20. \n6 Modehaus Elscheidt, Benesisstra\u00dfe 36. \n7 Boutique 69, Pfeilstra\u00dfe 31-35. \n\n\nRecords\nThere is an abundance of record stores in Cologne, but most are hidden in non-tourist quarters.\n\nFor a mainstream record store, go to Saturn, which opened in 1961 and certainly has the largest CD (and DVD) collection in the region. To pre-listen a record, hold it under one of the scanners spread throughout the shop. Always worth a visit. Subway and Regional Train from central station: Hansaring. The (office) building is from 1925 and was briefly the highest house in Europe (65 metres). A smaller Saturn shop is on the top floor of Galeria Kaufhof (listed above).\nIndependent record stores are spread around Saturn: Cross the street for 2nd hand and punk, follow the \"Ring\" (boulevard) north, and you will find Jazz, Electro and HipHop at Schallschock record store. Famous alternative music-store Normal is south of Saturn, as well as Underdog Record Store (specialized in Alternative Rock, Emo, Garage and related matters) Subway and Regional Train from central station: Hansaring\nFor electronic music, get off at Friesenplatz, and go to groove attack in Maastrichter street. Also famous is Kompakt record store. Both are connected to a label sharing the name, and putting out fine German electronic music. Subway: Friesenplatz\nA widely renowned collection of experimental music and niche music is to be found at A-Musik in Kleiner Griechenmarkt, close to Neumarkt.\n\n\nBooks\n8 Mayersche Buchhandlung, Neumarkt 2, 50667, K\u00f6ln (Tram stop \"Neumarkt\"), \u260f +49 221 203070, info-koeln-gal@mayersche.de. M-Sa 09:30-20:00; closed Su. The largest bookstore in Cologne; they stock a huge selection of books including sections in English and other languages. Also a wide selection of postcards. (updated Nov 2019)\nOn \"Ehrenstra\u00dfe\", you will find cheap and arty books, take a look at \"Buchhandlung K\u00f6nig\" at the eastern end, buy art books at well known \"Taschen\" at the corner of Ehrenstra\u00dfe and the Ring. Taschen was founded in Cologne in 1980 and is headquartered here.\nTravel books are bought best at \"Gleumes\", between Z\u00fclpicher Platz and Rudolfplatz. They have only maps and travel books, but these from around the world.\nBooks in English - \"English Books and Tea\", Auf dem Rothenberg 9a, in the old town, stocks a wide range of new and secondhand books in English. It also offers a choice of teas and conversation and invaluable tourist orientation - all in English.\nHonorable mention: \"Cafe Goldmund\" in Ehrenfeld. A very cozy corner-caf\u00e9 with all walls lined with bookshelves. You can buy every (second hand) book after you finished flipping through it while you enjoyed your drinks for a small tip. Also hosts small music and poetry events. Glasstra\u00dfe 2, right next to the S-Bahn station \"Ehrenfeld\".\n\n\nEat\nCologne has a wide variety of restaurants, German and otherwise, as a glance in the colored pages of the local telephone book will illustrate.\n\n\nTraditional scene\nOne can eat pretty well in most traditional-style K\u00f6lsch restaurants, and in fact as a visitor, you should try some of the local food, which is quite rustic, but tasty, hearty fare.\nThe brewery taps (Fr\u00fch, Sion, Pfaffen, Malzm\u00fchle, etc., in the old town south of the Dom) are worth taking note of to that respect, although they tend to be expensive for what you get.\nPlaces out of the way such as Schreckenskammer and Max Stark (north of the train station, the former being within crawling distance of the Station Backpackers Hostel), P\u00e4ffgen (Friesenstra\u00dfe) and both of the Cologne independent brewpubs (Hellers Brauhaus on Roonstra\u00dfe and Braustelle in Ehrenfeld) offer cheaper, better food than the old town tourist traps. Besides, most of these places have tons of atmosphere, which doesn't hurt!\nYou may also experience the deadly dry wit of the K\u00f6bes (traditional name of the blue-clad waiters) in most of those places. If it happens to you, don't get upset, just enter the game, send the K\u00f6bes packing with a dig and a smile and you'll be all right.\nYou'll mostly find typical Rheinland dishes in those traditional Kneipen. Classics include:\n\nHalve Hahn: nice big slab of Dutch gouda with a rye roll (R\u00f6ggelchen)\nHimmel un \u00c4d mit Fl\u00f6nz: fried black pudding with mashed potatoes (\"earth\"), apple sauce (\"heaven\") and fried onions.\nSoorbrode/Sauerbraten: joint marinated in vinegar with raisins, usually served with red cabbage and a kloss (potato dumpling). The joint may be beef or horsemeat, so you may want to ask first.\nDicke Bunne met Speck: boiled white beans with hefty boiled bacon slices on top.\nSchweinshaxe (grilled); H\u00e4mchen (cooked): pig's leg, usually a bit of a monster (ranges from 600 to 1400 g, including the bone)\nRievkooche/Reibekuchen: flat fried potato cakes usually on offer once a week, and served with a variety of sweet or savoury toppings, which may include apple sauce, R\u00fcbenkraut (the beet-sourced equivalent to black treacle) or smoked salmon with horseradish cream.\n\n\nEthnic scene\nIf you are looking for a snack, you can either head for one of the Middle-Eastern or Asian places, or you can make use of the traditional fast food places like McDonald's and Burger King. Italian restaurants in Cologne seem to attempt to aim for a higher quality than in the UK, though it is debatable whether they achieve it, and whether their prices (often 150-200% of UK prices) are justified. There are several Indian restaurants across the city, which serve a fair fare, though the visiting Brit may be slightly disappointed to find that German 'curry culture' is rather akin to that of the UK in the 1960s: menus are neither large and varied, nor regionalised and specialist, and although ingredients are fresh, the food without exception appears to be tamed-down for the conservative German palate and the cooks are rather hesitant to spice it up even if you ask for it. \"Clay Oven\" (Luxemburger Stra\u00dfe near S\u00fcdbahnhof) and \"Bombay\" (near Eifelstra\u00dfe tram station) do make a vindaloo that will satisfy the most hardy customer, though. Japanese and Thai restaurants are common; both are quite expensive.\nThere is an abundance of D\u00f6ner Kebab and similar takeaways around the town. Generally a lot of Turkish snack bar-style places can be found just north of the main station at Eigelstein, around Z\u00fclpicher Platz and in the Belgisches Viertel, with some excellent Lebanese and Persian takeaways further down Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe towards S\u00fcdbahnhof. Probably best now (though expensive) is Oruc D\u00f6ner on Kyffh\u00e4userstra\u00dfe (near Barbarossaplatz); while the kebab is quite good though not outstanding, their freshly baked pide bread is famous all over town. There are lots of Turkish restaurants and takeaways within Kalk, M\u00fclheim and (mainly restaurants) in the Belgisches Viertel.\n\n\nBudget\n\n\nIn and around the central train station\nThe ground floor of the central train station has a good number of cheap eateries, which include KFC to kiosks selling sausages.\n\n1 Weinhaus Vogel, Eigelstein 74. Real Cologne restaurant. Nice service, good food and tasty beer. A very special ambience. (updated May 2022)\n2 De Fressbud, Eigelstein 78. Number one currywurst in town. Warm people.

Exquisite German, but also international meals. \n22 Fischers Weingenuss & Tafelfreuden, Hohenstaufenring 53 (between Z\u00fclpicher Platz and Rudolfplatz). Exquisite French-like and modern food, great arrangements of wine and cheese. After noon you can get (quite) cheap 2-way dishes of the day including water or a glass of wine. You have to book (quite early) in advance and a menu will be created on your wishes. \n\n\nDrink\n\nTypical Cologne beer is called \"K\u00f6lsch\" and served in bars around town in small glasses, called \"Stangen\", of 0.2 L. That way the beer is always fresh and cold. Don't worry, waiters will be fast to bring you a new one once your old one is (almost) finished. In more traditional bars and especially the breweries, the waiter (called \"K\u00f6bes\" in local language) will even hand you a fresh K\u00f6lsch without being asked, so it is easy to lose track of how much you drank. He will put a pencil line on your coaster for each beer that you drank, this will be the basis for your bill, so do not lose it! To stop the beer from coming, leave your glass almost half full until you have asked for the bill or put your coaster on top of your empty glass.\nIf you buy bottled K\u00f6lsch, take either Reissdorf, Fr\u00fch, Gaffel or M\u00fchlen, which are rated highest by Cologne citizens. Those looking for a beer with a little more bitterness might like to try K\u00fcppers (there are about 30 more brands).\nThere are so many bars and pubs to choose from that you could spend most of the night going from one bar to the next.\n\nFor traditional breweries, head to the Altstadt around the Dom, where the Fr\u00fch K\u00f6lsch brewery is the most famous with visitors and locals. You will find a younger crowd at Hellers Brauhaus on Roonstra\u00dfe, near metro station Z\u00fclpicher Platz or Brauhaus P\u00fctz on Engelbertstra\u00dfe close to Rudolfplatz. Furthermore the P\u00e4ffgen, on the all-bar street Friesenstra\u00dfe close to the Friesenplatz, and the M\u00fchlen near Heumarkt are traditional brewery pubs but less touristy than the \"Fr\u00fch\". Also recommended is Sion, which is a lesser known brand, but hailed to be very good, although some beer enthusiasts have found it lacking character since 2007. Most Altstadt pubs are somewhat scorned as \"tourist traps\" by locals, however: prices here are usually higher than e.g. on Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe.\nThere are a lot of modern bars and lounges all around town. More mainstream ones are on Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe. For something more independent and funky on this street, try Umbruch (funky) or Stiefel (punky). The Low Budget on Aachener Stra\u00dfe next to Moltkestra\u00dfe metro is a nice, unassuming, punky bar which features a fine selection of drinks and often hosts concerts, poetry or cabaret sessions.\nA lot of stylish places are in the so-called Belgian quarter between Aachener Stra\u00dfe and the Ring, e.g. famous M20 or the Hallmackenreuther.\nA secret Tip are the Bars of the alternative Szene in Cologne. Those you may find the most in Ehrenfeld, like the \"Sonic Ballroom\", and in the S\u00fcdstadt, for instance the \"Tsunami Club\" and the little pub \"Lotta\", but also in the famous Kwartier Lateng, which is near the University of Cologne, around the Barbarossaplatz, at the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe and the Kyffh\u00e4user Stra\u00dfe. If you are searching for something more rough, you may find some nice places to rock and roll, on the Sch\u00e4l Sick in the cityparts Kalk, east from the K\u00f6lnarena, like the little Trash Chic bar in the Wiersbergstreet, and in M\u00fclheim, north from the K\u00f6lner Messe the little St. Pauli fanszene pub called \"Limes\", at the M\u00fclheimer Freiheit street, near the Wiener Platz. But, this places are better to be known visited by the younger and not so rich people. So take care of your pockets.\n\n\nK\u00f6lsch\n\n1 Fr\u00fch am Dom, Am Hof 12 \u2013 14 (Just south of the cathedral, behind the Domhotel), \u260f +49 221 2613- 211.

The hotel rates rise multi-fold during important fairs. If you do not have to, try not to stay in Cologne during those. Alternatively, you can try finding accommodation in D\u00fcsseldorf or Bonn, which are a short train ride away and are usually not affected by the rate hikes (but D\u00fcsseldorf has its own trade fair calendar, so mind it as well).\nFor accommodation services the city of Cologne charges an extra 5%-levy Kulturf\u00f6rderabgabe, which is included in your bills.\nNon-tourists, i.e. those who did not voluntarily choose to head for Cologne, can get the taxes reimbursed.\n\n\nCamping\n Campingplatz der Stadt K\u00f6ln.
