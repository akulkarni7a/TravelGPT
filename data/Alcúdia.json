  "extract": "Alc\u00fadia is a resort in the Raiguer district of Mallorca, near the northeast tip of the island. With a population of 21,300 in 2023, it has a well-preserved walled old town, and a long hotel strip on its sandy beach. \n\n\nUnderstand\nWhen the Roman Empire crumbled, their town of Pollentia was repeatedly attacked, until it was abandoned for a better-defended site 10 km inland: this is the present town of Pollen\u00e7a. The only habitation near the ruins was a Moorish farmstead on the hill above, al-kudja in Arabic. In 1229 Jaume I of Aragon muscled in on the territory, and from 1298 Jaume II built the walled town of Alc\u00fadia.\nNot much happened for the next 700 years, so it remained a small town and port unspoilt by industry. A few tourists arrived from the 1920s but the big boom, as elsewhere on Mallorca, was from the 1970s. A rash of hotels spread along the beach but didn't invade the old town, while the port acquired a leisure marina. There are bars a-plenty but Alc\u00fadia never wanted the frenetic clubbing scene of Magaluf. It's a relaxing place popular with young families and with pensioners.\n\n\nGet in\n \nAlc\u00fadia is 55 km northeast of Palma via Ma-13, a good highway.\nTIB Bus 302 runs from Palma de Mallorca every 20-30 min, taking an hour via Inca and Sa Pobla. It continues to the port, beach strip and Can Picafort, but you may not ride it just for that section. \nBus 322 runs from Pollen\u00e7a every 25 min to Port de Pollen\u00e7a, Alc\u00fadia town centre, port and beach. Bus 324 runs from Can Picafort every 15 min, and Bus 325 hourly from Cala Rajada via Can Picafort.\nBus 315 runs every 50 min from Sa Pobla, taking an hour via Can Picafort, the beach and port to Alc\u00fadia town centre.\nBus 231 runs from S\u00f3ller March-Oct four times a day, taking two hours via Mirador de ses Barques, Escorca, Lluc, and the town and port of Pollen\u00e7a.\n1 Port de Alc\u00fadia has daily Balearia car ferries from Barcelona. The quickest takes only 3 hr 30 min and is the most expensive; other sailings take 6-7 hours and may be on a triangular route via Menorca. \nMenorca Lines sail daily in the morning from Alc\u00fadia to Ciutadella on Menorca, taking 75 min. They return in the evening so a day-trip is possible in that direction.\n\n\nGet around\nLocal buses include 322 from Pollen\u00e7a, 324 from Can Picafort and 325 from Cala Rajada, as above. Bus 323 also shuttles every 50 min between Alc\u00fadia, the port, and Alcanada east on the headland. You may not use Bus 302 from Palma for local short hops.\nOver a dozen places offer car hire or bicycle hire. The narrow old town streets are pedestrianised.\nTaxi firms here are mostly in the business of airport transfers not short rides.\n\n\nSee\nA total  solar eclipse on Wednesday 12 Aug 2026, starting at 20:31 and lasting 90 seconds. The chances of a clear sky are 65%, but you need to move north to the hilltops and coast beyond Port de Pollen\u00e7a to get a clear view to the horizon, as the sun will be setting over the sea. 15 minutes later, sunset ends the show.\nCity walls encircle the old town, with a free walkway Cam\u00ed de Ronda open 24 hours. Built 1298 to 1362, they're best preserved to the north and west, where two of the four city gates also survive. An outer wall was added in the 16th century but later demolished.\n1 Church of Sant Jaume, Pla\u00e7a de Jaume Ques, \u260f +34 971 548665. Church founded in 1302 and incorporated into the city walls, so it doubled as a watchtower. It was undermined by floods in 1870 and collapsed, and re-built in 1890s neo-gothic. The museum displays religious art.   (updated Aug 2024)\n2 Bull ring (Pla\u00e7a de Toros). This was built in the 1920s but no longer has bullfights. It's occasionally open for cultural events.  (updated Aug 2024)\n3 Porta del Moll is one of the surviving city gates, two towers about an entrance through the walls.\n\n4 Roman Pollentia, Av Pr\u00ednceps d'Espanya, \u260f +34 971 547004. May-Oct M-F 08:30-19:30, Sa Su 08:30-14:00. A Roman camp here was rebuilt as a civilian town from 70 BC, when this was Mallorca's main port for trade with Rome and the east Med, while Palma was the port for North Africa and Spain. There's a residential area, necropolis and small amphitheatre. Enter from the north through the town walls. Adult \u20ac4, conc or child \u20ac2.50.  (updated Aug 2024)\nMuseu Monogr\u00e0fic next to the Church of Sant Jaume displays findings from Roman Pollentia.\n5 Municipal Cemetery is a riot of florid funerary monuments. It's open daily 08:00-18:00.\n6 Alcanada Lighthouse was completed in 1861 and automated in 1960. It's on an islet 150 m out, within swimming or SUP distance.\n7 Museu sa Bassa Blanca (Yannick and Ben Jakober Foundation), C del Collbaix, \u260f +34 971 546915. W-Sa 10:00-18:00, Su 10:00-15:00.

Adult \u20ac7, conc or child \u20ac5.  (updated Aug 2024)\n8 Ermita de la Victoria was built as a watchtower in 1679 and is now a baroque church. You can drive here or take various hiking or cycling trails onto the forested headland. There's a restaurant adjacent.\n9 Talaia d'Alc\u00fadia is the peak on the headland. The simplest ascent is from L'Ermita and might take 30 minutes.\n10 End Point is the evocative name of the tip of Alcanada peninsula. Just north, tiny Zero Island is probably so named to prevent visitors wasting their time reaching it.\n11 Gran Irland strange to say is not a Dublin-themed pub, but an islet in the lagoon reached by a causeway from the west. Wear scruffy old trainers, as the water laps over the causeway. Visitors often find it smelly and trash-strewn.\n12 Parc Natural de s'Albufera (Bus to Playa de Muro). Daily 09:00-17:00. Wetland wildlife reserve, with bird hides and hiking trails. Some trails are lengthy so it's worth bringing a bike. Free. (updated Aug 2024)\n\n\nDo\n\nAlc\u00fadia beach is a sandy bay 14 km long stretching to C'an Picafort, with Playa de Muro midway.

The apostle James the Great was martyred in 44 AD, with his pattern day taken as 25 July in western Christendom. He's the patron saint of Spain, where he's called Santiago, from Sancti Iacobi the church or sanctuary of Saint James. The town is decorated and there are various concerts, theatre, exhibitions, religious ceremonies and fireworks.\nTriennial of Holy Christ is a religious procession where the population parades barefoot through town in silence. In 1507, goes the legend, an image of Christ sweated blood and water to relieve a drought, as apparently a simple downpour was beyond his divine powers. It's on 26 July in 2025 then in 2028 and so on.\nAlc\u00fadia Jazz Festival is held in September.\nAgricultural fair is in early October\n\n\nBuy\nLidl is the main supermarket, at the roundabout 500 m from the beach, open daily 09:00-22:00.\nAlc\u00fadia Market is held next to Porta del Moll Su & Tu 08:30-13:30.\n\n\nEat\nAbout 20 restaurants in the old town centre, a similar number in Port d'Alc\u00fadia around the marina, and a dozen or so further south along Playa de Muro. Many close down out of season.\n\n\nDrink\nNo free-standing pubs in the old town centre, but a dozen at the port and more down the beach strip.\n\n\nSleep\n\nMost hotels are in Port d'Alc\u00fadia and Platja d'Alc\u00fadia along the 14-km-long beach that stretches all the way to Can Picafort.\nInmood Aucanada is blighted in 2024 by nearby construction work.\n1 Mar Hotel Alcanada, Pla\u00e7a Pompeu Fabra 7, \u260f +34 971 260444.
