  "extract": "Dachau is a city with about 44,800 citizens in Upper Bavaria, Germany and has a history of more than 1,200 years, but best known for being the location of the very first Nazi concentration camp. This has cast a pall over the rest of this small and pleasant town 20 km (13 mi) outside of Munich.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe first known documentation dealing with Dachau dates back to the year 805, although earlier settlements go as early as 1000 B.C. and the Romans were maintaining a salt road through the city at the beginning of the first millennium. Dachau first came to prominence during the Middle Ages, when Duke William IV of Bavaria commissioned the palace of Dachau in 1546-1577. From that time on until the end of the monarchy in Bavaria in 1918 the town had always been a retreat for Bavarian kings, dukes and nobility, which is no wonder as the palace and the surrounding gardens offer a staggering view of the Alps and Munich, weather permitting. Towards the end of the 19th century Dachau became a town famous for its impressionist painters like Carl Spitzweg.\nHowever, the city's history took a turn for the worse with the advent of the Nazi regime: Dachau was chosen to be the site of the very first Nazi concentration camp in 1933. Mostly political dissidents, non-conformist intellectuals and priests were imprisoned in the camp. Although Dachau was mainly used as a staging ground to ship prisoners to eastern death camps in Poland, approximately 42,000 people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in the Dachau camp itself or its 169 sub-camps. After World War II the camp was first used to house displaced persons and then converted into a memorial site, which opened in 1965, to remind visitors of the darkest time in German history. Today Dachau has a big cultural scene as well as a still impressive picture-perfect old town and palace, because it completely escaped Allied bombing during World War II.\n\n Tourist Information Dachau, Konrad-Adenauer-Stra\u00dfe 3, \u260f +49 8131 75286. \n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nDachau is conveniently located at several autobahns.\n\nA 8: Stuttgart - Dachau - Munich (exit 78 Dachau/F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck)\nA 92: Deggendorf - Dachau - Munich (exit 2 Oberschlei\u00dfheim)\nA 99: circular autobahn around Munich (exit 10 M\u00fcnchen-Ludwigsfeld)\nFurthermore, with B 304 and B471 two major federal highways run through the city.\n\n\nBy train\nRegional trains from Munich Central Station run three times an hour and take 25 min to reach Dachau.

The new building was designed by Heinrich Sch\u00f6ttl. Construction began in 1546 and was completed in 1577. It later became the favoured residence of the rulers of Bavaria.
