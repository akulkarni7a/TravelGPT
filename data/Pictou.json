  "extract": "Pictou is a small town of 3,200 people (2016) in Pictou County, Nova Scotia on the north-western shore of a natural harbour. It is most well-known for its claim to be the birthplace of new Scotland after the landing of the first settlers to come to Nova Scotia directly from Scotland in 1773. There are many old buildings to see, an attractive waterfront and several museums.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nOnce an active shipping port and the shire town of the county, today Pictou is primarily a local service centre for surrounding rural communities and is the primary tourist destination in this region of Nova Scotia.\nThe name Pictou, pronounced 'Pick-toe', derives from the Mi'kmaq name Piktuk, meaning \"explosive place\", a reference to the river of pitch that was found in the area, or perhaps from methane bubbling up from coal seams below the harbour.\n\n\nHistory\nPictou had been the location of an annual Mi'kmaq Aboriginal summer coastal community prior to European settlement. Pictou was part of the Epekwitk aq Piktuk Mi'kmaq District, which included present-day Prince Edward Island and Pictou.\nPictou was a receiving point for many Scottish immigrants moving to a new home in northern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island following the Highland Clearances of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The first wave of immigrants arrived on September 15, 1773, on the Hector.\nWhen the Hector arrived, there were already a few families in Pictou that had arrived on the Betsy six years earlier. The town has an indirect connection to Scottish settlement in New Zealand; the Reverend Norman McLeod emigrated to Pictou from Scotland some years after the Hector but eventually re-settled with his parishioners at St. Ann's on Cape Breton Island, and later to Waipu where there are still many descendants from Pictou and St. Ann's.\n\nIn 1812, Sir Hector Maclean (the 7th Baronet of Morvern and 23rd Chief of the Clan Maclean) emigrated to Pictou from Glensanda and Kingairloch in Scotland with almost the entire population of 500. Sir Hector is buried in the cemetery at Pictou.\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century, Pictou's industrial sector gained strength. The Intercolonial Railway was built to the town on a spur from the Stellarton-Oxford Junction \"Short Line\". Shipbuilding increased through the 19th century, particularly with the increase in coal being shipped from Pictou Landing, Abercrombie and the East River of Pictou. Shipyards have been established in the town since this period. CN Rail abandoned its service to the town in the late 1980s but other transportation - including Highway 106 (the Trans-Canada Highway) - opened in the 1970s to provide alternatives.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy road\nSpeed demons coming from New Brunswick, Cape Breton or Halifax can get to Pictou quickly via the Highway 104 and the short connecting Highway 106. A more leisurely drive from New Brunswick can be taken along Trunk 6.  Highway 104 is part of the main route route of the Trans-Canada Highway.  Highway 106 continues at Highway 1 on Prince Edward Island, and both of those highways are part of a branch of Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n\nBy ferry\nIt's the closest town in Nova Scotia to the Prince Edward Island ferry connecting from Wood Islands.  Ferry crossing time is 75 minutes. There are as few as 3 sailings per direction per day in the winter and more than double that at other times of the year.\n\n\nGet around\n\nWalk - around town - it's only 2 km from one end of downtown to the other.\nDrive - around to the different attractions in Pictou County\nCabs - a $5 cab ride gets you just about anywhere\nWater taxis and boat tours of the harbour are available, which also connect to the town of New Glasgow.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Hector Heritage Quay (The Ship Hector), 33 Caladh Avenue, \u260f +1 902 485-4371, shiphectortoursandevents@gmail.com.
