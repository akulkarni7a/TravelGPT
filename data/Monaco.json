  "extract": "The Principality of Monaco (French: Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco) is a wealthy city-state on the Mediterranean Sea, bounded by the French Riviera. Though tiny, the country is packed with entertainment for those with money to burn: think yachts and casinos, plus the annual Formula 1 Grand Prix.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThis is the second smallest independent state in the world (after the Vatican) and is entirely urban. Monte Carlo is not the capital of Monaco but a government district. The country is divided into nine sectors: Monaco-Ville (the old city), the Condamine (port quarter), Monte-Carlo (business and recreation) and Fontvieille (recreation, second port for smaller boats and light industry) are the most well-known among them.\nWith no natural resources to exploit other than its location and climate, the principality has become a resort for tourists and a tax haven for wealthy people. Monaco is six times the size of the Vatican and the world's most densely populated country. While its borders have not moved since 1861 (when it lost over 80% of its territory to France), Monaco has still grown its territory by creating artificial land from the sea, which is how the area Fontvielle came to be. Its size is smaller than Central Park.\n\n\nTourist information\n Visit Monaco. Tourist information website. (updated Jan 2024)\n Office of Tourism, 2a boulevard des Moulins, Monte-Carlo. M-Sa 09:30-17:00. (updated Jan 2024)\n Information Desk, Place Sainte-D\u00e9vote / SNCF railway station - 2nd floor, Monte-Carlo. M-Sa 09:00-17:00. (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nRead\nRainier and Grace, republished as Grace of Monaco, by Jeffrey Robinson. An account of the lives of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco, intertwined with the history of the country. The author knew Rainier and Grace personally, and he interviewed members of the royal family for the book.\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: French phrasebook\nFrench is the official and most frequently used language. Monegasque, the historic language of the native populace, is offered (but seldom taught) in schools, but rarely used outside of official documents and street signs. Due to Monaco's status as a destination for wealthy visitors, English is widely understood. Other languages that are commonly spoken are Italian (many jobs in Monaco require a solid knowledge of Italian), German, and Russian.\n\n\nMobile phones\nAs an independent state, Monaco has its own mobile phone networks. Although these are provided by the same multinationals as operate in France, if your phone connects to a Monaco network, it will count as 'roaming' in a new country, and as it is outside the EU, the EU directives and individual company's offers on the cost of roaming may not apply. If you are travelling through Monaco by train, the mobile signal at the station will be from Monaco, so you can be caught by this even if you never get off the train. Similarly, when travelling in France or offshore close to the border with Monaco, the strongest signal may be from a Monaco network.\n\n\nGet in\nAlthough Monaco is not part of the Schengen Area, it has open borders with France, so it can for all practical purposes be considered part of it. If you want a passport stamp, you can queue for one at the Mairie de Monaco. There is border control for arriving boats from outside the Schengen Area.\nIf you want to stay for more than 90 days, you will need to obtain a residence permit.\nMonaco does not issue its own visas, and instead accepts a Schengen visa for entry. If you plan to visit only Monaco and are entering by boat directly from outside the Schengen Area, you will need to apply for a Schengen visa from a French diplomatic mission (if one is required for your nationality).\n\n\nBy plane\nThe nearest airport is at Nice,  1 A\u00e9roport Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur (NCE IATA) in Alpes-Maritimes, which is around 40 km (25 mi) away from the city centre. It receives daily flights from nearly all of Europe's main cities, such as London and Paris.\nE-hailing from the airport to Monaco is available for example by Uber and Bolt. For the way back to the airport check the e-hailing section.\nTaxis are always available outside the terminal buildings, but make sure a fee is agreed in advance or the meter is switched on at the start of the journey, as shady taxi drivers are notorious for charging tourists whatever they see fit.\nYou can take a tram from the airport to Grand Ar\u00e9nas and change there to the train to Monaco for about \u20ac6 (Mar 2024).\nAn express shuttle, route 80, links the Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport and Menton with multiple stops near all major hotels throughout Monaco, not just the ward of Monte Carlo. A bus leaves every half hour and a single ticket costs \u20ac19.50 (Mar 2024).\n\n\nBy helicopter transfer\n\n2 Monacair, Heliport de Monaco, Av. des Ligures, \u260f +377 97973900. The sole operator of regular helicopter transfers between Nice Airport and the Monaco Heliport. After collecting your luggage at the Nice airport, present yourself at the Monacair reception desks (in terminals 1 and 2). A ground crew will carry your luggage and drive you to the heliport. The flight along the coast is beautiful and only lasts 8 minutes. When arriving at the Monaco heliport along the water's edge, a chauffeur will take you directly to your hotel. When leaving Monaco, a partnership with airlines allows for a direct transfer to the boarding gate with your cabin luggage. Check with the company if these benefits are applicable to your airline. Rates start from \u20ac210/person for one-way transfers and can go up to \u20ac11,600 for a private twin-engine helicopter, which can seat up to 6 passenger. During major events this price can increase significantly. (updated Nov 2022)\n\n\nBy train\nThe train stopping in Monaco operates along the coast from Cannes in France to Ventimiglia in Italy. The train also stops for example in Menton, Nice and Antibes and is run by SNCF. There are 2-4 services per hour. There are also occasional high-speed TGV services (via Nice to Paris, 6 hr 30 min). The sometimes still mentioned Intercity/Thello services to Italy no longer exist.\nFrom Genoa and Milano you can take a direct train to Ventimiglia and change there to the train to Monaco. In Ventimiglia, it is easier not to use the Trenitalia counters or machines. Go to the travel agency (the only one) inside the station, which is marked with the sign of SNCF (French Railways). Return tickets not tied to a specific train are also available. Remember to validate your tickets just before boarding using the machines on the platforms.\n\n3 Monaco-Monte-Carlo railway station (Gare de Monaco-Monte-Carlo), Place Sainte D\u00e9vote. The principality's only railway station and operated by the French railway company SNCF. It is about 300 m back from Port Hercule, the layout is somewhat confusing as the station has been built underground with an adjacent huge parking garage - the main entrance is by elevator from \"above\". There are ticket vending machines and few food outlets, including a Starbucks.   (updated Sep 2022)\n\n\nBy car\nMonaco is easily accessed by its land borders from France or Italy by a network of highways, most commonly used of which is the A8 which runs west from Monte Carlo to Nice and Marseilles, and east towards the Italian border.\nBetween Nice and Monaco, there are also three more scenic roads: the Basse Corniche (Low Coast-Road - Highway 98), along the sea, the Moyenne Corniche (Middle Coast Road - Highway 7), going through Eze-Village, and the Grande Corniche (Great Coast Road), going through La Turbie and Col d'Eze (Eze Pass).  All are pretty drives offering spectacular views over the Coast line.  For an extra-special treat, rent a convertible sports car from the many airport rental services and take in the French Riviera in style.\nParking is plentiful in Monaco.  There is very little street parking, however, garage parking is easy to find.  Check Monapass App for availability.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nCommon ride sharing apps available in France such as Uber or Bolt can be used to go to Monaco from nearby French cities such as Nice. However, these apps are not legal in Monaco: drivers can drop you in Monaco but cannot pick you up in Monaco. To leave Monaco with these apps you can walk to France (for instance to boulevard des Moneghetti in Beausoleil) and order an Uber from France. You can also stay in Monaco but select a pick up location in France and add a stop in Monaco where you are. Make sure you call or text the driver to inform them that no one will be at the first location. This is legal as drivers can stop for rides started outside the territory of Monaco.\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: intercity buses in France\nRegional buses connect Monaco with Nice, Menton and other French destinations. There is no bus station in Monaco. Instead, the regional buses stop at various points throughout the city.\nFlixbus does not stop in the country. The nearest stops are in Nice and Ventimiglia, where you can change to the train to Monaco.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nMonaco's two ports are no strangers to private yachts. 4 Port Hercule is exceptionally beautiful and offers mooring and anchoring possibilities for up to 500 vessels, some of which are extremely large and elegant (in fact, many tourists often take time out of their day to simply have a drink by the water and admire the fantastic super yachts).  The 5 Port of Fontvieille, integrated into the new district, can receive as many as 60 vessels of at least 30m in length.  Both are large and well-equipped.\nMonaco also serves as an embarkation port and port-of-call for cruises, so large cruise ships can often be spotted sailing in or out of Port Hercule.\nIn close proximity, the 6 Port of Cap d'Ail is also a choice destination for pleasure-boats.\n\n\nOn foot\n\nA pleasant way to arrive in Monaco is to walk on the \"7 Sentier du bord de mer (from Cap d'Ail)\" (seaside trail), about a 3 km (1.9 mi) and 45-minute walk on a concrete path in a natural and peaceful setting. Take the train and stop at the Cap d'Ail train station (the last before Monaco when coming from Nice; not all the trains stop there). Outside of the train station, follow the road a few meters and take the stairs on the left to pass under the tracks. Once you reach the small road, turn left and walk a few meters, then take the stairs on your right next to the restaurant \"La Pin\u00e8de\" to join the trail. If you want to do the route from Monaco to Cap d'ail station, go to the west of Fontvieille ward, cross to the French border to join the Cap d'Ail port and follow the seashore. After a few minutes you will arrive to the \"8 Sentier du bord de mer (from Monaco)\" just after a final parking lot. It can be dangerous and closed in case of bad weather. In this case you will have either to go back and take the train, or walk on the road. There is no lighting at night.\n\n\nGet around\n\nNote that (as of September 2024) it is very difficult to store luggage. The train station info desk even has a sign outright saying it's not possible anywhere in the country.\n\n\nBy foot\nWalking is by far the best way to get around Monaco; however, there are some areas, such as the Exotic Gardens, that require a large change in elevation and therefore make for rather strenuous hikes.   There are also seven public escalators and elevators (all free) that help negotiate the steep slopes of the city.  If you find yourself afoot and wanting to reach the opposite bank of Port Hercule, look for the small 9 Bateau Bus, a pedestrian-only ferry that runs each 20 minutes or so during daylight; it costs \u20ac2.\n\n\nBy bus\nMonaco has an urban bus service, operated by the Compagnie des Autobus Monaco, through the city's five bus routes (labelled 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) which serves 143 stops. Each stop has the bus numbers that stop there, and most stops feature a real-time display showing waiting times for the next service. Each stop has a name and a network map. The service usually starts at around 06:00 and runs right through until about 21:00. Tickets can be purchased on board the buses (\u20ac2) or at many news vendors and shops throughout the city and at auto ticket machines at the bus stops (\u20ac1.50) \u2014 often it will be advertised as to where you can do this.  A daily pass allows you to use the buses all day for \u20ac5.50 (2016) and can also be purchased on board the bus. A night bus service operates in a circular route from 22:00 until 04:00.\n\n\nBy motor scooter\nYou can easily rent a motor scooter in Nice and take a short trip east along the sea into Monaco. The views are beautiful and the ride is fun along the twisty seaside road.  There are plenty of places to park for free.  Theft is not a concern, as there are cameras throughout and police everywhere. To rent one whilst there, you must be at least 16 years old.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nCycling is definitely a good option to get around in Monaco, but the traffic in high season can be intimidating.\n\n MonaBike. Monaco's official bike rental scheme. Credit card and mobile data needed. \u20ac3/24h.  (updated Aug 2023)\n10 The Bike Shop by Philippe Gilbert, 7 Rue des A\u00e7ores, \u260f +37797974935. Rents out e-Bikes and road bikes (updated Aug 2023)\n11 MonecoBike, Les Jardins d'Apolline, 1 Prom. Honor\u00e9 II, \u260f +37799902404. Rental of e-Bikes. \u20ac45/day (less if booked for multiple days). (updated Aug 2023)\n\n\nBy car\nPrivate cars are singularly useless for getting around Monaco, as you'll spend more time trying to park than if you walked or took a taxi instead.\nInternational rental car companies do have offices at the airport in Nice and also in Monte Carlo city. These include Avis, Gare Monte Carlo, Europcar and Hertz - drivers must have held a national driving license for at least one year and it is usually requested that the cost is paid for with the driver\u2019s credit card. Driving in the city center can be intimidating in Monte Carlo with heavy traffic - however, it is often worth this to drive alongside the more expensive vehicles in the city! Make sure to request a car with an automatic gearbox if you are not used to driving manual.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis cannot be hailed on the streets (they won't stop) and there are two main taxi stands open around the clock at the Avenue de Monte Carlo and the railway station, although it is always best to agree a fee beforehand or make sure the meter is running.  Most hotels will provide taxis or courtesy drivers. The best is to get the taxi service phone number to be able to call a taxi wherever you are.\nUber, Bolt and other ride sharing apps are banned in Monaco.\n\n\nSee\nThe principality of Monaco offers a great balance of historical and modern attractions. There are various museums and palaces to visit as well as shopping malls and casinos. Monaco also offers relaxation spots along the harbour and even around the attractions. It is relatively easy to navigate Monte Carlo and Monaco if you take the time to learn where the various \"short cuts\" are. City maps are generally available at most news vendor stands and shops for a small fee. The 12 Tourist information could be a good starting point before venturing to explore the city.\n\n1 Monte Carlo Casino (Grand Casino), Place du Casino, \u260f +377 98 06 41 51, vip@montecarlocasinos.com. 14:00-04:00. The Monte Carlo Casino is a gambling and entertainment complex which includes a casino, the Op\u00e9ra de Monaco, and the office of Les Ballets de Monte Carlo. Owned and operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco (SBM), a public company in which the Monaco government and the ruling family have a majority interest. The company also owns the principal hotels, sports clubs, foodservice establishments, and nightclubs throughout Monaco. If your wallet permits it, try your luck in the Grand Casino and gamble alongside the world's richest and often most famous. You'll need your passport to enter (as Mon\u00e9gasque citizens are prohibited from gambling at the casino), and the fees for entry range enormously depending on what room you are going to; often from \u20ac30 up into the hundreds. The dress code inside is extremely strict: men are required to wear coats and ties, and casual shoes are forbidden. The gaming rooms themselves are spectacular, with stained glass, paintings, and sculptures everywhere. It is possible to enter the casino as a guest from 10:00-13:00 for \u20ac17. The casino is not open for business at that time of day but visitors are provided with a half-hour audioguide and are permitted to walk freely through the premises. Minors are also allowed entry at this time too, and the dress code is less strictly enforced.   (updated Mar 2020)\n\n2 Op\u00e9ra de Monaco (Monaco Opera House) (On the backside of the Casino), \u260f +377 98 06 28 00. Tu-Sa 10:00-17:30; Su M off.

There have been some of the most superior international performances of ballet, opera and concerts held in the opera house for more than a century; consider taking in a show during your visit although it is expensive.   (updated Sep 2016)\n\n3 Monaco-Ville (Monaco City). Take a walk through Monaco-Ville, also known as \u201cLe Rocher\u201d or \u201cThe rock.\u201d Monaco-Ville is still a medieval village at heart and an astonishingly picturesque site.

It is also one of Europe's premier social highlights of the year. The Automobile Club of Monaco (ACM) organizes this spectacular race each year in late May, with the next on 23-25 May 2025. The Grand Prix is 78 laps around 3.34 kilometers of Monte Carlo's most narrow and twisted streets. The main attraction of the Monaco Grand Prix is the proximity of the speeding Formula One cars to the race spectators. The thrill of screaming engines, smoking tires and determined drivers also makes the Monaco Grand Prix one of the most exciting races in the world. There are more than 37,000 seats available for sale on the circuit ranging from \u20ac310 (at Boulevard Albert 1er) to \u20ac600 (at Casino Square) for a ticket on race day. Monaco residents often rent out their terraces for the event with prices ranging from \u20ac8,000 to \u20ac140,000 for the four days. During the rest of the year (except during the Historic Grand Prix and the ePrix; see below), it is possible to walk around the circuit. Tourist office maps have the route clearly marked on their maps, although devotees won't need them! For those who can afford it, you can also take a ride around the track in a performance car.

An exhibition, which features luxury aircraft, automobile, banking, boat, footwear, handbag, jewellery, real estate and wine products. The exhibition itself is less of an attraction than what actually happens on the street during the show.

Held every third week of April each year. \u20ac36-50 for adults, \u20ac18-25 for children.   (updated Sep 2016)\n Rallye Monte Carlo, \u260f +377 93 15 26 00, info@acm.mc.

(updated Sep 2016)\n3 Hike along the coastal path from Monaco to Carnoles. A beautiful walk with splendid views towards Monaco. It takes roughly 2 hours from Monte-Carlo to circle Cap-Martin and finally reach Carnoles train station, where you can catch a train back to Monaco. An alternative to go back is by bus number 100. The overall distance is about 9 km. (updated Sep 2016)\n4 Azur Express (Departure opposite the Oceanographic museum), \u260f +377 92 05 64 38, contact@monacotours.mc.

It has featured such artist as Natalie Cole, Andrea Bocelli, the Beach Boys, Lionel Richie and Julio Iglesias. The club also hosts a small casino which includes basic casino games.

Attend a football game of the local team. They play in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football, and often qualify for European tournaments. The stadium, capacity 18,500, is on reclaimed land on the southern border of Monaco: one of a select few where a wayward shot on goal might see the ball land in another country. \u20ac15-75.

(updated Nov 2020)\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nLike its neighbour, France, Monaco uses the euro. Currency exchange is readily available for a wide range of currencies. ATMs are commonplace.\nFor coin collectors visiting Monaco, its euro coins are issued in limited amounts for general circulation and are perfect souvenirs to bring home.\n\n\nShopping\nShopping in Monte Carlo is usually quite exclusive and is certainly no place for a budget holiday. There are plenty of places to melt the credit card alongside Europe's high rollers. The chic clothes shops are in the Golden Circle, framed by Avenue Monte Carlo, Avenue des Beaux-Arts and All\u00e9es Lumi\u00e9res, where Herm\u00e8s, Christian Dior, Gucci and Prada all have a presence. The area on and around Place du Casino is home to high-end jewellers such as Bulgari, Cartier and Chopard. You will find, however, that most tourists will simply enjoy wandering the area and window shopping, even if you don't buy anything. The normal shopping hours are from 09:00 to 12:00 and 15:00 to 19:00.\nFor a more cultured take on shopping in Monte Carlo, try the Condamine Market. The market, which can be found in the Place d'Armes, has been in existence since 1880 and is lively and attractive - many hours can be spent simply wandering around, bargaining for souvenirs from the many tiny shops, boutiques and friendly locals. If however, your shopping tastes are more modern, just take a short walk along the esplanade to the rue Princess Caroline pedestrian mall.\nThe Fontvieille Shopping Centre is also a more \"normal\" shopping experience with 36 shops selling electronic goods, CDs, furniture, and clothes as well as a Carrefour supermarket and McDonald's. The tourist office also issues a useful free shopping guide to the city.\n\n1 Le M\u00e9tropole Shopping Center, 17 Avenue des Sp\u00e9lugues, \u260f +377 93 50 15 36, contact@ccmetropole.com. M-Sa 10:00-20:00; Su off. 80 shops in a beautiful ambient. The chandeliers are amazing. (updated Sep 2016)\nSome stores to browse or buy:\n\n Fred Boutique, 6, av des Beaux-Arts, Monte Carlo. Located on the exclusive avenue of des Beaux-Arts, this is one of only a handful of Fred boutiques in the world. An official jeweller of Monaco's royal family and a favorite of celebrities, you may not be able to afford much in this boutique, but it's worth a jaw dropping visit. If you go to Monte Carlo, you shouldn't miss this. \n Boutique du Rocher, 1, av de la Madone, Monte Carlo. Opened by Princess Grace in the 1960s, visitors still come for the best in souvenirs. Choose from hand-carved frames and mirrors, ceramics, homewares and toys. Prices are moderate and all proceeds go to local charities. \n Davidoff, 17, av des Sp\u00e9lugues, Les galeries du M\u00e9tropole, Monte Carlo. High end cigar and cigarette store, where you are assisted by staff that know their product well. \n Galerie Moghadam, 23 & 41, bd des Moulins, Monte Carlo. Award-winning speciality shop that offers superb hand woven tapestries and carpets. \n Pratoni Monaco, 7, Avenue Princesse Grace (Larvotto). 10:00-12:30, 14:00-19:30. Monaco fashion brand Pratoni offers a variety of ready-to-wear clothing & accessories for gentlemen in addition to wide range of made-to-measure services. All items are of high quality, and made in Italy or Monaco. \n\n\nEat\nFood in Monaco is varied, but generally expensive, and even very basic meals often cost over \u20ac20-30. Take a look at the menu before entering even shabby restaurants or you may be in for a surprise. There are places where you can find decent value, but they often require knowing about beforehand. Restaurants where locals dine are often located a little bit away from the waterfront and often serve better food for lower prices (however, since you are in Monaco: nothing is a bargain).\nThere are many restaurants catering to tourists, from the Cafe de Paris across the street from the casino, to the waterfront restaurants along the Port de Fontvieille. During the winter months, you will find the restaurants to have a slightly lower price tag. Bouillabaisse is a good tip.\n\n\nBudget\nThere is a variety of restaurants and caf\u00e9s in the city with a moderate price tag and excellent food. A few simple caf\u00e9s exist along the marina-side, more like beach bars than anything else, serving simple meals such as pizza, salads and hotdogs throughout the day. These can be good for sitting back during the hot midday with a cold beer or glass of wine, a snack to recharge your batteries from exploring the city, and the gentle lapping of the Mediterranean (and often the roar of supercars) in your ears. Most of these restaurants are equipped with water-misters in the ceilings that gently cool and refresh the clientele.\n\n1 Chez Roger (In the market hall east of Place d'Armes), \u260f +37793508020. M-Sa 09:45-13:30. Try the typical food of the region. Socca (chickpea pancakes) for \u20ac3 and Pissaladi\u00e8re (caramelized onion and anchovy tart) for \u20ac2 (Aug 2020).

They also have a rotisserie corner with a wide choice. For real honest good food in Monaco here is the place to go. (updated Aug 2022)\n4 Lo Sfizio Street, 14 Av. Saint-Charles. Yummy pizzas. The dough and the filling is quite exceptional. The service is with a smile and you can even eat quietly on the tables on the terrace on the pedestrian street. (updated Aug 2022)\n5 Maison des p\u00e2tes Saint-Charles, 14 Av. Saint-Charles. Good fresh made pasta with best Service. The pasta, gnocchi and ravioli are very good, the sauces varied and well cooked. You will only find extraordinarily delicious takeaway products here. And the welcome is always warm.

American-style sports bar with sports and film memorabilia in cases on the walls, and a playroom for kids. They serve cold-pressed juices and a large American-style menu with many Mexican dishes, all using organic ingredients.

Daily 08:00-02:00. The nerve centre of Monte Carlo, where people go to see and be seen, buzzing with the feel of old time Monte Carlo, circa early 1900s. Menu items change frequently, as do the waiters, who seem intent on rushing patrons through their meals. For people-watching, you could try a diet Coke for \u20ac6, glass of beer for \u20ac14 and ice cream for \u20ac16 (June 2017). Reservations to dine are recommended.   (updated Aug 2022)\n8 Beefbar, 42 Quai Jean-Charles Rey, \u260f +37797770929. Daily 14:30-00:00. Quality cuts of beef on offer, attached with high, though surprisingly worthwhile price tag. Small cups on puree are available for the meat, though an additional cup (one is far too small), costs \u20ac8.5 (Aug 2020). Wine selections are paired perfectly with the red meat. Chic atmosphere and the staff are extremely attentive. (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\nSplurge\nDining in Monaco can be a very sobering experience to whomever is paying the bill. Perhaps the most exclusive and famous restaurants in the city are the Louis XV Restaurant and the Le Grill de L'Hotel de Paris, both centered on the very exclusive Hotel de Paris. You are more than likely to be seated next to a member of the rich and famous, and the gourmet food is simply out-of-this-world although the experiences come with a rather hefty price tag.\n\n9 Louis XV, H\u00f4tel de Paris - Place du Casino, \u260f +377 98 06 88 64, adhp@sbm.mc. Sa Su 12:00-13:45, Th-M 19:30-21:45; Tu W off.

Reservations are essential, as are jacket and tie for men. \u00c1 la carte from \u20ac200 (not including drinks), set lunch for \u20ac180/person (Aug 2020).

Although often overlooked by the famed Louis XV, look above to the Hotel de Paris' rooftop for its equally elegant contender. Less intimidating than the Ducasse citadel downstairs, Le Grill offers every imaginable sort of grilled fish, and meat that come from the nearby Alps. The selection of 600,000 wines are the perfect accompaniment to every dish, and the service is impeccable. Dining on the rooftop affords you stunning, panoramic views of Monte Carlo, and in the summer, a blanket of starry sky. A la carte approximately \u20ac60-80 (neither drinks nor starter included). Set menu for lunch \u20ac65 (Aug 2020).  (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\nDrink\nChampagne has the status of a national beverage in Monaco. A single glass can cost as much as \u20ac40 at a fashionable restaurant!\n\n1 Jimmy\u2019z Monte-Carlo, 26 avenue Princesse Grace, \u260f +377 98 06 70 68, jimmyz@sbm.mc. Open all night from 23:30. The ultimate night club in Monaco (it's not actually in Monte Carlo), the famed Jimmy'z is frequented by royalty and the uber-rich, which isn't a surprise considering some of the hefty price tags, a beer will cost you upwards of \u20ac26. If you are not willing to afford it, there are other clubs to go to. There are two entrances: one, two floors down in Le Sporting Club, the other at street level, and many rock stars and billionaires have walked through both. Staff can be quite rude, but so are most of the patrons. Definitely an experience. (updated Mar 2020)\n2 Buddha-Bar Monte-Carlo, Place du Casino (a short walk up the stairs from the hairpin curve at Fairmont Hotel), \u260f +377 98 06 19 19, buddhabarmontecarlo@sbm.mc.

(updated Aug 2020)\n5 The Bar @ Columbus Hotel, 23 Avenue des Papalins Monte Carlo, \u260f +377 92 059000. More laid-back and informal than some of its counterparts, its subdued atmosphere is a refreshing change from some of the high energy Monaco bars. Decked out in shades of blue, it's almost as sweet as the chocolate martinis, which come with a big truffle in each glass which slowly dissolves into your drinks and tastes heavenly. (updated Mar 2020)\n6 La Rascasse. One of the most famous bars in the city due the final curve of the F1 track, which is named after the place.  (updated Dec 2020)\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nBudget\nIf you're on a budget, Monaco is not the best place to be. A better option is to stay in one of the towns outside of Monaco:\n\nNice \u2013 20 min away by cheap and frequent trains from Monaco. Or you take the bus along the coast.

From \u20ac370. (updated Jul 2021)\n\n\nWork\nAll foreigners are required to obtain a work permit to work in Monaco. As Monaco is not a member of the European Union, even citizens of EU countries are required to obtain a work permit.\n\n\nRespect\nIn many ways, the Respect section of the France page can detail how to be respectful toward the Monegasque population, but Monaco is a separate nation and it may be insulting to casually conflate the two. Monaco's population retain their own history, their own culture, and their own lifestyle. Directions or other help are only a smile and a question away.\n\n\nStay safe\nMonaco is one of the safest places on the planet, with nationwide video surveillance and one police officer per 100 residents. You can feel safe wearing your diamonds and Rolex, even for a night walk through the streets or coastline, with almost no street-crime, and a strong police presence. It has one of the lowest homicide rates of any country in the world, and among the lowest in terms of overall violent crime. Because of their wealth, public spaces are blanketed with cameras and any kind of disorder may produce an immediate reaction and the attendance of several officers. However, pickpocketing may occur during sporting events, like the Formula One Grand Prix and major football games.\nHomosexuality is legal, although there are no specifically gay places in Monaco. You can walk with your same-sex partner hand in hand without being insulted in public places.\nMonaco security can follow anyone on public areas, streets & corridors, using the vast camera network without losing you from their screens.\nBe wary of dive-bombing seagulls. They like to steal food from people eating outdoors.\n\n\nStay healthy\nTap water is safe to drink.\n\n\nConnect\nMonaco has its own mobile phone operator, Monaco Telecom, which is not covered by EU's roaming rules. This means that mobile numbers and SIM cards registered in a EU country, including France, may incur roaming charges much like everywhere outside of Europe (or any SIM card from outside of the EU within it). Pay heed to it if you hope to visit Monaco as part of your European trip and make sure to set up your phone NOT to automatically switch to the strongest available network, as well as consider switching off data transmission while roaming, before heading for Monaco.\nAlthough Monaco was the world's first country to have full operational 5g coverage, if you don't use the local Monaco Telecom or French Orange, internet is extremely slow or even non-functional.\nSome operators include Monaco among countries billed on \"home rules\" in some subscription plans, so if your operator is generous enough, you may leave Monaco unscathed. Remember to check beforehand.\nPostal service is provided by La Poste Monaco, a subsidiary of the French postal service. However, regular French stamps cannot be used to send mail from Monaco, and you will need to purchase Monaco stamps for that.\n\n\nGo next\nOther places at the Cote d'Azur, like \u00c8ze, Nice, Antibes, Cannes\nCoastal towns further west along the French Riviera, like Saint Tropez, and Marseille\nMaritime Alps\nItaly (Ligurian coast, Genoa, Milan, et al.)",
