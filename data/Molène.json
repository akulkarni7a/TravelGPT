In summer, there are more boats.\nDuration:\n\n2h from Brest\n30 minutes from Le Conquet.\nFor schedule and fares, see the Penn ar Bed Web site.\nFrom the jetty (located in the north-east of Mol\u00e8ne), Mol\u00e8ne harbor (and center) is hardly 10 minutes by foot. Otherwise, there is a shuttle, that costs 2\u20ac50 per passenger.\n\n\nBy helicopter\nA heliport allows to reach the mainland if you are in a hurry (and wealthy).\n\n\nGet around\nThe island is almost entirely car free.\nConsidering its size, it is very easy to go by foot.\nMost of the \"streets\" are in fact car-free, and cannot even be cycled.\n\n\nSee\n1 The semaphore. Open all weekends and public holidays in May and June, and everyday during the school vacation (except February) and in September.. Texts in French, English and Breton. Free entrance.. \n2 Drummond Castle exhibition. \n3 The Church. Built in 1881. \n4 The Ledenez Vraz island.

Charcot. \n\n\nDo\nGoing around the island takes about one hour by foot.\n\n\nBuy\n1 Proxy Market. Open every day (with quite reduced schedule though). Small supermarket in the \"bourg\".

Open from Monday to Saturday (with reduced schedule too). \n3 Bureau de tabac. Open almost every day.

Alternatively, there is a strong (and fast) 3G+ on the island, thanks to an antenna in the middle of the island.\nSome restaurants and caf\u00e9s offer free Wi-Fi.\n\n\nGo next\nOuessant\nMainland Finist\u00e8re and Brittany",
