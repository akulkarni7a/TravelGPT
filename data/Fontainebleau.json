  "extract": "Fontainebleau is a lovely historic town 55.5 km (34.5 miles) south of Paris, France. It is renowned for its large and scenic forest that surrounds one almighty ch\u00e2teau, once a hunting lodge beloved of the kings of France. Fontainebleau is a favourite weekend getaway for Parisians, and attracts crowds of tourists.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n \nGetting there is very easy from Paris.\n\n\nBy train\nFrequent trains run from Gare de Lyon: you may take Transilien Ligne R towards Montargis or Montereau and alight at Fontainebleau-Avon (around 40 minutes) or else take RER Line D as far as Melun then catch a bus for a further 20 minutes. If you don't have a pass covering zones 1-5, you will require an \"Billet Origine Destination\": these tickets can only be bought from the ticket counter or the Billet \u00cele-de-France machines (not the SNCF machines), cost \u20ac5 each-way (as of October 2024), and include one metro/tram/RER connection within Paris. They cannot be used on the bus in Fontainebleau.\n\n\nTo the ch\u00e2teau\nFrom the 1 Gare de Fontainebleau Avon  Bus 3401 leaves frequently, taking 15-20 minutes to reach Chateau / Place Bonaparte, and costing \u20ac2.15 (you may use a Paris Metro Ticket t+ or a Paris day travel pass, should you have one). Otherwise, walking takes around 30 minutes and is very pleasant.\n\n\nTo the forest\nGenerally speaking, to reach the forest in the immediate vicinity of the town, you may follow the steps above to reach the town. The Tourist Office (Place de la Republique) can provide maps and advice on walking routes.\nOn weekends and French public holidays, the 08:16am and 09:16am departures from Paris Gare de Lyon stop at the Fontainebleau-Foret station: this station is not found on the route maps, and return trains to Paris do NOT stop here. If you alight here, the nearest station (Vulaines-sur-Seine) is 3.3km away and Gare de Fontainebleau-Avon itself is nearly 4km distant. This station is in the middle of the forest: please ensure that you have a map (or appropriately charged smartphone) and appropriate footwear and clothing.\n\n\nBy car\nFontainebleau is around 65km from Paris: follow signs towards the south, then signs for Lyon and the A6. After about 35 minutes you will see signs for Fontainebleau. Once entering the city there is a tall apartment block which is a remnant of some architectural style a lot in the city would like to see disappear. However, it still forms part of the town\u2019s history \u2013 as much as the castle even if in much less splendour.\n\n\nGet around\nOrientation in town is very easy as there is only one main artery called the \u201cRue Grande\u201d which goes from the Castle to the other end of town, passing by the central \u201cNapol\u00e9on Bonaparte\u201d place.  Many shops, bars and restaurants abound on either sidewalk for every possible taste.\nWalking is by far the best option as the most you\u2019ll walk without stopping (very difficult thing to do considering all the pretty windows to look at) would be 20 minutes.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau (Palace of Fontainebleau). 09:30-17:00 in winter; 09:30-18:00 in summer. This is one of the most beautiful chateaux in France. Its interior decorations are especially interesting as a fine example of the French Renaissance style. At the same time, its historical significance is hard to overestimate, since it was the preferred residence of French kings and emperors for 7 centuries. The first mention of the castle dates back to 1137 but by the time when Fran\u00e7ois I decided to make it his principal residence (1527), the medieval castle was mostly in ruins. This monarch undertook an ambitious reconstruction program, playing himself the role of the chief architect and inviting two prominent Italian artists, Rosso and Primatice to decorate the interior. Their collaboration resulted in such treasures as the Fran\u00e7ois I gallery (pictured right) with wooden panels, stuccoes and frescoes depicting various episodes from the life of the king; the Church of the Trinity and the Ball room are also from this epoch. After Fran\u00e7ois I, many French monarchs chose Fontainebleau as their residence; the construction started by Fran\u00e7ois I was mostly completed under Henri II and Henri IV. Louis XIII, the son of Henri IV was born in Fontainebleau; the tourists can see the room where Marie de' Medici delivered the baby and imagine how crowded it was at the time: to avoid any risk of substitution, the birth of the king must take place in presence of many witnesses.Somewhat neglected during the French Revolution, the Fontainebleau castle is back to its glory under the reign of Napoleon I, who lived there for a long time and bade his farewell to his troops in the court of the castle in 1814. The visitor can see the Emperor's Throne room (unique in France) and his private apartments. Pope Pius VII visited Fontainebleau twice, first as a guest and then as a prisoner of Napoleon; the papal quarters are open to visitors. After your visit to the main building, do not forget to take a stroll in the park and the gardens around the castle; you will see Diane's fountain and (if you are lucky) meet one of the peacocks who live there. Although by no means less interesting than the Versailles castle, the Fontainebleau castle is a bit more difficult to reach and less known to tourists; as a result, there are at least ten times less visitors in Fontainebleau than in Versailles. Except maybe on national holidays, there is never a queue to get in, and you can explore the immense castle almost on your own, which, together with the fresh air and the absence of street vendors contributes to make your visit a very peaceful and enjoyable experience. The castle is open every day except Tuesday, January 1, May 1 and December 25th. Entrance fee for adults is free for children below 18 and residents of the EU below 26. UNESCO World Heritage Site [1] \u20ac11/adult, \u20ac9/reduced. (updated Oct 2017)\n2 For\u00eat de Fontainebleau (Fontainebleau Forest). An important forest area of 25,000 ha with an altitude ranging from 42 m to 144 m. Each year, millions of visitors come to walk (13 million in 2006). 40,000 years ago, nomadic populations were established near the forest. Around the year 1000, the forest was composed of a series of enclaves that shared little lords and wealthy landowners . For the kings of France, the forest had indeed many uses including hunting and a military interest. In 1400, Charles VI ordered the first amendment of the forest. Under Francis I, the forest consisted of only 13 365 ha but the Kings expanded it through acquisitions and forfeitures. It was at this time the management of the forest and administration took shape and was kept until the Revolution. At the time of Louis XIV, less than 20% of the area was forested. Colbert launched a new reformation in 1664 replanting the sites. The king then traverses the forest each year in the fall for hunting. In 1716, after the terrible winter of 1709, a new forest management was enacted: 6000 ha were planted with deciduous trees, but this was an almost total failure. A new development was revived in 1750. In 1786, a shy introduction of Scots pine is attempted. In 1750, around 90 km from the forest is bounded by 1050 terminals still visible today. After the Revolution, after many deep cuts and proliferation of game misconduct hunting Napoleon in 1807 reformed the forest administration and the castle. In 1830, the planting of 6,000 ha of other pine angered artists who seek inspiration in the forest. In 1839, Claude-Fran\u00e7ois Denecourt released its first guide forest walks and trails the first landscape in 1842 In 1849 the railway arrived at Fontainebleau, which will allow Parisians to visit Fontainebleau by day trips . In 1861 was created the first artistic reserve 1097 ha. It is the first nature reserve in the world, even before the creation of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. In 1953, the first biological reserves were created. \n3 Mus\u00e9e d'art figuratif contemporain (Contemporary Figurative Art Museum), 43, rue Royale. \n4 Mus\u00e9e des pompiers (Firemen Museum), 2, place Orloff. \n Mus\u00e9e napol\u00e9onien d'art et d'histoire (Napoleonic Museum of Art and History), 88, rue Saint-Honor\u00e9. \n5 Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte (not well-served by public transport, nearest station is Melun on the RER D, but it's still quite a long way away so you'll need to hitch a ride from there to the ch\u00e2teau.).
