  "extract": "Aberdeen (Scottish Gaelic: Obar Dheathain, Scots: Aiberdeen) is the third-largest city in Scotland, United Kingdom, with a population of almost 200,000 (2018). It is a harbour city on Scotland's north-east coast, approximately 120 miles (190 km) north of Edinburgh and 400 miles (650 km) north of London, where the Rivers Dee and Don meet the North Sea. It is an important sea port, regional centre, and the hub of the North Sea oil industry.\nAlthough remote by UK standards, this is no backwater; Aberdeen is a prosperous and cosmopolitan city (partly due to North Sea oil) and is characterised by its grand and ornate architecture. Most buildings are constructed out of granite quarried in and around the city, and as a result, Aberdeen is often referred to as The Granite City. It is also known for its many outstanding parks, gardens and floral displays throughout the city, and for its long, sandy beach. Aberdeen boasts the title of Oil Capital of Europe and has been voted in several polls as the happiest place in Britain, with a 2006 poll citing access to large areas of greenery and community spirit. It has won the Britain in Bloom competition 10 times.\nAberdeen does not attract as many tourists as other Scottish destinations such as Edinburgh or St Andrews, and can feel more authentic. It is a great place to stop for a couple of days on a tour of Scotland, and especially good as a base for exploring the wider region to take advantage of the castles, golf, whisky distilleries, scenery, mountains (including skiing and snowboarding), coast and other attractions in Aberdeenshire and Royal Deeside. Alternatively, Aberdeen's remoteness yet comforts and cosmopolitan nature makes it an interesting destination for a short city break if you really want to get away from the stress.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAberdeen is set in fertile lowlands and is the natural regional centre, becoming a city in 1179 when two villages grew into each other. Old Aberdeen is north, by the mouth of the River Don, and home to the University since 1495. New Aberdeen developed from 1136 two miles south near the mouth of the River Dee: this has a much better harbour and became the city centre. It was bashed about in conflicts until 1745, but then followed a long spell of peace and prosperity. Aberdeen was rebuilt in its signature grey granite along the broad axis of Union Street east-west, which intersects the historic coast road then at Castlegate turns north along King Street. So grand and confident were these buildings, they bankrupted the city in 1817, probably a civic first. Aberdeen recovered through its traditional industries based on farming, fishing, knitware and paper, but by the late 20th century these were in decline. The city was out on a limb, a long way from markets, materials and labour... and then they struck oil.\nIn the 1960s the North Sea was shown to have commercially exciting reserves of gas to the south and oil to the north, and the quirks of international frontiers awarded Britain the lion's share. This transformed UK politics and the economy, nowhere more so than in Aberdeen. The oilfields lay many miles offshore, but in a relatively shallow sea, and technology advanced to exploit them. Oil was brought ashore at Sullom Voe in Shetland and at Grangemouth on the Firth of Forth. It never came through Aberdeen: the city's role was as a support base for the oil platforms, and centre of industrial innovation as the quest for new fields moved into deeper darker waters. The skies were busy with the chatter of helicopters ferrying workers to and from the rigs. The city was a boom town and property prices soared.\n\"It's Scotland's Oil!\" became a rallying cry, OPEC quotas drove up the oil price and until 2014 it looked as if oil could fuel the vehicle of Scottish independence. But a referendum voted against it, and the price later collapsed. The price, and Aberdeen's fortunes, have been up and down since, illustrating the risks around a single cash crop. Moreover, sentiment turned against oil as a carbon-based fuel from a dwindling non-renewable source. The industry remains a big player here, but the city needs to diversify. \n\nAberdeen is a year-round destination, provided you've got enough weather-proof clothing. Its winters are mild compared to other cities at about 56-57 North such as Riga, Gothenburg, Juneau or Novosibirsk, but by British standards it's cool. It's sheltered from the prevailing southwesterly airstream, so it has many sunny days when the granite buildings sparkle; the parks and gardens are glorious in early summer. Mid-summer days are 18 hours long and the nights no more than twilight. In still conditions a fog bank or haar forms over the cold North Sea, and the evening breeze brings it onshore to cloak the city, until the daytime offshore breeze pushes it out again. Northeasterly winds bring the worst of the dreich, a word worth practising before you arrive, and the midwinter sun often fails to get out of bed for its allotted shift of 8:30AM-3:30PM. Between the louring low grey clouds, drizzle and churning grey sea, you can pretty much lose the entire grey city.\nEven then, you'll still know where you are because of the unique dialect known as \"Doric\". This is even more marked in the countryside, so see Aberdeenshire#Talk for the gen on Doric, which to date defies machine translation. \n\n\nVistor information\nVisit Scotland guide to Aberdeen & Aberdeenshire\n1 Aberdeen iCentre, 23 Union Street AB11 5BP, \u260f +44 1224 269180, aberdeen@visitscotland.com.

(updated Feb 2024)\n\n\nRead\nSunset Song is the classic novel of this region in the last days of horse-drawn farming, and the onslaught of the First World War. Written by Lewis Grassic Gibbon (James Leslie Mitchell 1901-35) and published in 1932, it's been voted Scotland's favourite novel. It may also be the most \"given up on\" novel, problems being the artificial diction used to render Mearns country speech, and the \"Cold Comfort Farm\" heaping up of misfortunes; but it's worth persevering or a second go.\nCloud Howe (1933) is the second of Gibbon's \"Scots Quair\" trilogy and Grey Granite (1934) the third, as the heroine rebuilds her life and moves to the city. They're not as well regarded but all have been adapted for TV. And then young Gibbon upped and died, with so much creative output yet before him.\nLogan McRae is the fictional Detective Sergeant who probes the city streets in the thrillers by Stuart MacBride (b 1969). These include Cold Granite (2005), Dying Light (2006), Blind Eye (2009), Shatter the Bones (2011), Close to the Bone (2013) and The Missing and the Dead (2015).\nStonemouth (2012, televised 2015) is a novel by Iain Banks (1954-2013), following a man returning to a small seaport (loosely based on Stonehaven) having fled after a sex scandal.\nSilver: An Aberdeen Anthology (2009) is a collection of poems old and new, edited by Alan Spence and Hazel Hutchison.\nArchitecture: look for Aberdeen: The Illustrated Architectural Guide by W. A. Brogden (4th edition, 2012) and The Granite Mile: The Story of Aberdeen's Union Street (2010) by Diane Morgan, among others.\nFind them in Waterstone's bookstore (Union Street/Trinity Shopping Centre) or WH Smith (in St Nicholas Centre) \"local interest\" sections. Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct has a local section just inside the doorway.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are direct international flights to Aberdeen from Amsterdam, Bergen, Burgas, Copenhagen, Dublin, Esbjerg, Gdansk, Geneva, Groningen, Haugesund, Paris CDG, Riga, Oslo, and Stavanger, plus seasonal flights to the Mediterranean.\nThere's a good range of UK flights, as Aberdeen is far to reach by rail. These include London Heathrow (with BA), London Gatwick and Luton (with easyJet), Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Durham, Humberside, Kirkwall on Orkney, Leeds, Manchester, Norwich, Newcastle, Southampton, Stornoway on Lewis, Sumburgh on Shetland, and Wick. \nAberdeen is also a hub for transfers to the weird sounding destinations of Apache, Hurricane, Ineos, and Nexen. These are the names of oil and gas rigs out in the North Sea, served by helicopter from here.\n1 Aberdeen International Airport (ABZ  IATA) is at Dyce, 7 miles (11 km) northwest from the city centre. There are car rental desks here but their stock is limited, best book in advance.\nBetween airport and city centre, take the bus. The Jet 727 is a big blue Stagecoach bus, running every 10-30 min to the main bus station in Union Square, next to the railway station. It runs daily between 4AM and midnight, taking 30 min. In early 2019, a single ticket costs \u00a33.40 and a return (good for 28 days) costs \u00a35. Bus 747 / 757 runs south from the airport direct to Stonehaven and Montrose, and north to Ellon with some buses continuing to Peterhead.\nDyce has a railway station, but it's wrong side of the runway from the terminal, a 45-min walk with no public transport. You could take a taxi there: you'd only do this to pick up a northbound train without going into city centre. The Aberdeen to Inverness trains stop at Dyce, Inverurie, Insch, Huntly, Keith, Forres and Nairn.\nA taxi to town will cost about \u00a320.\n\n\nBy train\n\nWikivoyage has a guide to Rail travel in Great Britain.\nAberdeen has trains hourly from Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street, both taking 2 hr 30 min, via Dundee. From England it's usually quicker to change in Edinburgh, but there are a few direct daytime trains from London King's Cross (via Peterborough, York and Newcastle) taking 7 hours. Likewise from the Midlands, with two or three trains winding all the way from Penzance via Exeter, Bristol, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, York, Newcastle and Edinburgh. Trains also run from Inverness to Aberdeen every couple of hours, taking about 2 hours.\nThe Dundee-Aberdeen railway was closed for 12 weeks following a landslide and serious rail accident near Stonehaven on 12 Aug 2020, but it re-opened in November.\nThe Caledonian Highland Sleeper runs Su-F from London Euston, departing around 9:30PM to arrive by 7:40AM. (Other portions run to Inverness and Fort William; they divide or join at Edinburgh.) The southbound train leaves around 9:30PM to reach Euston towards 8AM. No trains on Saturday night. New rolling stock was introduced on all the sleeper routes in 2019. Compartments have two berths and are sold like hotel rooms: you pay extra for single occupancy, and you won't be sharing with a stranger. Tickets can be booked at any UK mainline railway station or online: a single sleeper fare is around \u00a3200 for one or \u00a3250 for two people (as of June 2022). You can also just use the sitting saloon, single \u00a375. If you have an existing ticket for a daytime train you need to buy a sleeper supplement. Pricing is dynamic: weekends cost more, if indeed there are berths available. Booking is open 12 months ahead: you need to print out your e-ticket to present on boarding.\n2 Aberdeen Railway Station is in the city centre on Guild Street, one block from Union Street, very close to the bus station and ferry terminal. There's a Travel Centre (M-F 6:30AM-9:30PM, Sa 6:30AM-7PM, Su 9AM-21\n9:30PM), a left-luggage facility (M-Sa 7:30AM-9:30PM, Su 9AM-9PM), ticket machines, ATMs, a WH Smith store selling books, magazines and snacks, a caf\u00e9 and toilets. Lots more convenience stores and quick eats in the adjoining Union Square retail complex.\n\n\nBy bus\nBuses from London Victoria take about 13 hours; they pick up at intermediate points, for example, Manchester, but routes vary. Megabus has two direct buses per day and three with a change (two of them overnight). National Express has one daytime and one overnight direct bus, daily.\nBuses from Edinburgh take 3 hours, all via Dundee, but bypassing Perth. Megabus G92 runs four times M-Sa, thrice on Sunday. Scottish Citylink also have some half-a-dozen buses, so it's an hourly service.\nBuses from Glasgow likewise take 3 hours. Megabus G9 has six buses daily, mostly bypassing Perth and Dundee. Scottish Citylink run almost hourly and do serve Perth and Dundee.\nFrom Inverness take Stagecoach Bus 10. On Saturday only this runs hourly direct to Aberdeen, taking four hours. Other days it only runs to Inverurie, to connect with Bus 37 to Aberdeen. There are 3 connecting services M-F and one on Sunday.\nStagecoach buses fan out from Aberdeen all across the county, see \"Get in\" details for individual towns.\n3 Aberdeen Bus Station is on Guild St, Union Square, next to the railway station. So you can use all the facilities there, e.g. the left-luggage office.\n\n\nBy car\n\nFrom 30 May 2024, the city centre will be a Low Emission Zone. There will be a \u00a360 penalty charge for driving into the city centre in a non-compliant car or van. Cars built after 2015 generally are compliant, but check online. The zone covers an area of a few blocks around Union Street.\nThe main road to Aberdeen from the south is A90, running from Edinburgh via the new Queen's Crossing (replacing the Forth Road Bridge), across Fife to bypass Perth and Dundee, inland to Forfar then Stonehaven, then turn onto A92 for the last stretch into Aberdeen. It's dual carriageway as far as Dundee, variable thereafter, with lower speed limits and many speed cameras on the Dundee section. Reckon 3 hours from Edinburgh and 3 hr 30 min from Glasgow.\nIn Feb 2019 the A90 was re-routed away from Aberdeen, with the opening of the \"Aberdeen Western Peripheral Road\" to relieve the congested A92. Expect glitches in road signage and Satnav directions for a few months yet.\nAnother route from the south is to take A93 north from Perth over Glenshee to Braemar, Balmoral and the Dee valley. It's scenic in summer but often difficult in winter, when the Glenshee section may be closed by snow.\nFrom the north-west, take A96 via the airport at Dyce. Reckon up to four hours from Inverness, as it's single-carriageway and serves commuter villages that are short on public transport, so traffic is heavy at rush hour.\n\n\nBy boat\n\nAberdeen Harbour is right in the city centre, just about the first thing you see on leaving the bus station. The ferry terminal is off Market Street, next to the Union St car park entrance.\nNorthLink car ferries sail overnight, year-round, to Lerwick in the Shetland Islands. Three or four nights a week they depart at 5PM and also call at Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands on the way; the other nights they depart at 7PM and sail non-stop to Lerwick. (They never call at tiny midway Fair Isle, which is reached via Shetland.) For practicalities of using these ferries, see Shetland Islands#Getin and Kirkwall#Getin.\nCruise ships often call at the harbour in summer. Check operators' websites to see if a point-to-point journey to Aberdeen is feasible.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nOn foot\nWalking is an excellent way to get around Aberdeen, particularly around central areas, as the city centre is relatively compact. Walking is also by far the best way to appreciate the grand architecture of the city. However, the city is not that small (e.g. Union Street is one mile long) so for journeys outside of the city centre, wheeled transport may be useful.\nAberdeen has a mediaeval layout like many cities in the UK, so for the first-time visitor, a map is helpful. There are quite a few of these on signs around the city centre, mainly in points of interest (e.g. the Castlegate). However, it is very useful to have a map of the city to carry with you. You can buy maps from the Tourist Information Centre on the corner of Union Street and Shiprow, or from city bookstores.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nMost city buses are operated by First Aberdeen. Pay on entry by cash (no change given), contactless bank card or mTicket. In 2021 the single fare by cash is adult \u00a31.70, child \u00a31.25; a day ticket is adult \u00a34.40, child \u00a32.60. These don't include night buses, or the Park & Ride which is \u00a33.60. \nThe mTicket (for day tickets or longer) doesn't save much, but avoids fumbling for the right change. You buy online or at Paypoint outlets, and display it on your phone.\nUseful routes are Buses 1 and 2 from Robert Gordon University in the south, through Union Square transport hub, then north up King St to Bridge of Don, Old Aberdeen and the University of Aberdeen.\nStagecoach run the buses to other towns across Aberdeenshire, see \"Get in\" options for each town. These are sometimes better for edge-of-city transport.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis wait at the railway station, Back Wynd (off central Union Street), Chapel St (west end of Union St), Hadden Street (off Market Street) and at the airport. They're saloons or people-carriers of any colour, not London-style black cabs. Taxis and drivers must be registered with the City Council and carry an official registration plate, which is usually on the back. \nThe main taxi companies are Aberdeen Taxis +44 1224 200200 and Rainbow City +44 1224 878787. Uber does not operate here.\nFares are regulated: in Jan 2022 it's \u00a32.40 for the first 950 yards then 20p for every 180.5 yards, so reckon \u00a33.40 for the first mile and \u00a32 per subsequent mile. \nGood luck finding one when the pubs are closing: at night taxis won't pick up waifs and strays flagging them in the street. So either queue at a rank or phone, and be prepared for a long wait either way.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nThis is fraught in city centre traffic, where walking is first choice, but more helpful further out. Aberdeen City Council publishes a map of local cycle routes, which is also available in public libraries and at council offices. See below for the Deeside Way cycling and walking route to Banchory and Ballater. \nBike hire is available from Macdui or BeCycle.\nThere isn't a bike-share scheme. Bike lockers at the Park & Rides are for a year's hire, so they're designed for regular commuters not brief visitors.\n\n\nSee\n\nGranite architecture is the defining feature of the city, though much is showing its age. See Read above for more on city architecture. Highlights are:\nUnion Street has a mile-long stretch: but look up, the street frontage in many places is modern. Town House (city hall) is a confident Victorian example. Each building has its own style and scale, it's not like, say, Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne with a unified style.\nMarischal College on Broad Street has been nicely cleaned up. It was acclaimed by Betjeman as \"tower on tower, forests of pinnacles, a group of palatial buildings rivalled only by the Houses of Parliament at Westminster\".\nCastlegate has the baronial Salvation Army Citadel.\nRosemount Viaduct has the elegant cluster of His Majesty's Theatre, St Mark's Church and the Central Library.\n\n1 Union Terrace Gardens, Union Terrace AB10 1NJ. A small city-centre park and sunken garden on one side of Union Terrace. A small river, the Denburn, used to flow here but is now covered by the railway. The gardens are a haven of tranquility and greenery in the city-centre. In summer look out for the floral coat of arms, and in warm weather citizens sunbathe and picnic on the lawns. All year round, the gardens give a good view of the surrounding architecture. From 2010 the park was threatened with grandiose redevelopment plans, but in 2012 the council scrapped this idea. A more modest plan was undertaken for \u00a328.3 million and the park was closed from 2019 -2022. Free.   (updated May 2023)\n2 Aberdeen Beach  stretches for two miles from Footdee by the harbour and mouth of the Dee to Donmouth near Old Aberdeen. It's sandy and popular for surfing and windsurfing; you'll need a wet suit as the North Sea is cold (not that you'd guess from those iconic 1920s railway publicity posters). It's flanked by an Esplanade, good for walking or running. The south Footdee end has a funfair, ice rink, and leisure centre, plus city facilities such as restaurants and a cinema. The quieter north end is flanked by King Links golf course and ends at the Donmouth wildlife reserve.\n3 Footdee  (pronounced \"Fitty\") is a well-preserved fishing village laid out in 1809, in a pleasing unity of style. The name is a conflation of \"St Fittick\", \"Foot of Dee\" (ie the estuary) and \"Fish Town\".\n4 Girdle Ness is the headland south of the Dee estuary. Torry Battery guarding the harbour entrance was built in medieval times. In 1860 it was re-fortified against no-one in particular, and got to fire its guns just once, in 1941, against two friendly approaching vessels that failed to identify themselves. The Ness ends with the 1833 Stevenson Lighthouse, which has a range of 25 miles and was automated in 1991. Nigg Golf Club plays on the Ness, see below.\nDuthie Park is a pleasant green space on the north bank of the Dee. Its highlight is the Winter Gardens.\n5 David Welch Winter Gardens, Polmuir Rd AB11 7HT, \u260f +44 1224 585310. Daily: Nov-Mar noon-4PM; Apr Sep Oct 10AM-5:30PM; May-Aug 10AM-7:30PM. Large indoor gardens in a variety of glasshouse habitats (wheelchair-friendly), with tropical, arid, ferns and Japanese gardens. You can enter via Polmuir Road or Riverside Drive just after the railway bridge. Free.   (updated Dec 2021)\n6 Johnston Gardens, Viewfield Road (Bus 16 from Union Street). Daily 8AM until an hour before dusk. Small, bosky park in a residential area, full of floral displays, water features and rockeries. Toilets are in the car park. Free.   (updated Dec 2021)\n7 Hazlehead Park (off Queens Road, on the western edge of the city). 8AM until an hour before dusk. Large 180-hectare park on land granted to the city by King Robert the Bruce in 1319. Gardens include the Queen Mother Rose Garden, and the North Sea Memorial Garden to remember the 167 people killed on the Piper Alpha oil rig in 1988. Get lost in the hedge maze then have a cuppa in the cafe. Pay a \u00a33 admission charge to see a collection of domestic and farm animals in the Pets Corner. free.   (updated Mar 2019)\n\n\nMuseums and galleries\n\n8 Aberdeen Maritime Museum, Shiprow, \u260f +44 1224 337700, info@aagm.co.uk. M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-4PM. This museum, rated 5-star by the Scottish Tourist Board, tells the story of Aberdeen's relationship with the sea, from fishing to trade to North Sea oil. It offers an extraordinary insight into the mechanics and technology of ships and oil rigs, Aberdeen's rich maritime history and the lives of some of the people who have worked offshore in the North Sea for the past 500 years. The newest part of the complex is a blue, glass-fronted building on the cobbled Shiprow. Inside is a spiral walkway, rising upwards around an eye-catching model of an oil rig. Connected to this structure are the much older buildings which take visitors through a series of castle-style corridors and staircases to reach the numerous room sets, historical artefacts and scale models. If your time in Aberdeen is limited, go and see this. There is so much to see, and even the buildings themselves are worth a look. There is also a restaurant that is slightly expensive, but the food is pretty good. There are excellent views of the harbour from the top floor. Admission free.   (updated Oct 2021)\n\n9 Aberdeen Art Gallery, Schoolhill, \u260f +44 1224 523700, info@aagm.co.uk. M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-4PM. The Aberdeen Art Gallery is set in a Victorian building with an exquisite marble and granite main hall. On the ground floor are housed modern works including pieces by Tracy Emin and Gilbert & George, with many others. Upstairs hang more traditional paintings and sculpture. These include Impressionist pieces and workandy the Scottish Colourists. There are frequent temporary exhibitions (see website) and also display of antique silverware and decorative pieces. Columns in the main hall display the many different colours of local granite used to build the city. There is a good gift shop too. For those who like art, an afternoon could easily be spent here, but at least a quick browse is well worth it for anyone. Admission free.   (updated Oct 2021)\n10 The Gordon Highlanders Museum, St. Lukes Viewfield Road (Bus 11 from Union St.), \u260f +44 1224 311200, museum@gordonhighlanders.com. Feb-Nov: Tu-Sa 10:30AM-4:30PM, Su 1:30-4:30PM. At the Gordon Highlanders Museum you can re-live the compelling and dramatic story of one of the British Army's most famous regiments, through the lives of its outstanding personalities and of the kilted soldiers of the North East of Scotland who filled its ranks. Exhibits include a real Nazi flag from Hitler's staff car, and there is a small cinema where you can watch a film on the history of the regiment. For the younger visitors there are a number of uniforms to try on, and there is also a coffee shop. There are some mock-up first world war trenches. The museum is housed in the home of the Victorian artist Sir George Reid, and has a large garden. For those interested in military history this small gem is a must. Adults: \u00a38.00, children: \u00a34.50.   (updated Mar 2020)\n11 Provost Skene's House, \u260f +44 1224 641086. M-Sa 10AM-5PM, Su 11AM-4PM. Guestrow (walk under passageway at St. Nicholas House on Broad Street and it's in the little plaza there). Scottish towns and cities have a \"provost\" instead of a mayor and this house used to belong to Provost George Skene. The large, picturesque house dates from 1545 (it's the oldest house left in the city). Admission free.   (updated Oct 2021)\n12 Tolbooth Museum, Castle Street AB11 5BB, \u260f +44 1224 621167. as of Jan 2024 it is temporarily closed, pending building survey. The tolbooth was the main municipal building or Town Hall, for council meetings, courthouse and jail. This 17th-century example had jail cells in centuries past, and played a key role in the city's history, including the Jacobite rebellions. The museum has fascinating displays on crime and punishment, and on the history of the city. Limited access for visitors with mobility difficulties. Free.   (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nOld Aberdeen\n13 Old Aberdeen  is the most attractive part of the city, home to the University of Aberdeen's King's College Campus, but it's a misnomer. It was chartered as a burgh in 1489, later than the medieval city centre, but called \"Aulton\", the town by the pool, which morphed into \"old town\". Get here on Bus 1 or 2 from Union St or Bus 20 from Broad St. The core of it is along High Street.\n14 Powis Gates are a pair of minaret-cum-chesspiece-cum-candlesticks, erected in 1834 as the entrance to a genteel estate, and now the gateway to university Halls of Residence.\n15 King's College Chapel was consecrated in 1509; its Crown Tower is a symbol of the city and of the university.

Daily 9AM-4:30PM (Oct to Mar); 9AM-7PM (Apr to Sep). 4.5 hectare (11-acre) garden including an arboretum. (updated Sep 2024)\n20 St Machar's Cathedral is on The Chanonry, the northern continuation of High St. It's mostly from 1530, and was built larger but partly collapsed. It's Church of Scotland and a \"High Kirk\", not actually a cathedral, as the C of S doesn't have bishops.\nCathedral Walk north of St Machar's crosses the park to the student village in a loop of the river.\n\n\nDo\n\nWhat's on?

One of the oldest universities in the UK (founded 1495), it is renowned for its teaching and research in a full range of disciplines including the liberal arts, sciences, social sciences and the professions. Until the University of the Highlands and Islands was created in 2011 with its centre at Inverness, Aberdeen was the most northerly university in the UK (the Robert Gordon University, also in the city, is a little way south of the University of Aberdeen). It is a research-focused university of about 15,000 students, most at its main Kings College campus in Old Aberdeen, but some at its Medical School at Foresterhill. The Medical School is prestigious and the centre of a great deal of research, and is where (for example) the MRI scanner was developed. The university's iconic buildings, Marischal College (in the city centre but now occupied by Aberdeen City Council) and the tower of Kings College, are also iconic images of the city of Aberdeen. A huge new library was opened in 2011 at the Kings College campus. It is of unusual architecture for Aberdeen, taking the form of a seven-story zebra-striped tower. the Sir Duncan Rice Library is open to the public and outstanding views are available from the upper floors; ID is needed to sign in. The university provides popular part-time adult education courses, in addition to its Language Centre which also provides classes in languages at all levels.   \n22 The Robert Gordon University (RGU), Garthdee Road, Aberdeen, AB10 7QG, \u260f +44 1224 262000. Usually referred to as \"RGU\", it became a university in 1992 but developed out of an educational institution dating from 1750 founded by the Aberdeen merchant and philanthropist Robert Gordon. The word \"The\" is officially part of the title. It has a suburban campus at Garthdee in the south-west of the city by the banks of the River Dee, known for its modern architecture by major architects such as Norman Foster and Associates. A campus in the city centre was operated also but it has transferred to the main Garthdee campus, although the university still owns its Administration Building on the Schoolhill, next to the Art Gallery (designed to match it for the building used to be a school of art). RGU has been rising rapidly in university rankings and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by the Sunday Times, and equivalent standings in 2013, in addition to other recent awards. It is a teaching-focused university of about 15,500 students but significant research is also conducted (but not as much as the University of Aberdeen). Degrees are offered from undergraduate to PhD level in a wide range of disciplines, primarily vocational and professional disciplines and those most applicable to business. It has become known for its high level of graduate employment of around 97%. The university's art school, Gray's School of Art, offers short courses in art, sculpture, photography and fashion to the general public with no need for prior training.

(updated Oct 2021)\nTravelodge is at the junction of A96 and A947 south of the airport. They also have two in city centre.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nAberdeen is broadly safe, but you need to use your street sense. There is the usual motley crowd of drunks, beggars, rough sleepers and sex workers. Aggressive drunks are the main hassle, especially at weekends: the centre is heavily policed but trouble can flare in a moment. Some drunks are capable of assaulting lampposts that they reckon have looked at them amiss, so English football colours are a red rag to a bull. Above all don't be drunk or drugged yourself.\nAreas to avoid, especially after dark, are Tillydrone (north of Bedford Road and east of St Machar Drive) and Torry (the south bank of River Dee).\n\n\nConnect\nAs of Oct 2021, city centre has 5G from all UK carriers. This doesn't extend very far out but all the burbs and the airport have 4G. Wifi is widely available in public places.\n\n2 Aberdeen Central Library, Rosemount Viaduct (just along from His Majesty's Theatre, or right in front of you if you walk down Union Terrace from Union Street). Daily 9AM-5PM (till 8PM on M and W). The central library (one of the libraries founded by Andrew Carnegie) has a few computers on the upper level where you can access the internet for up to 20 minutes free of charge without being a library member. They are situated next to the staircase. \n\n\nCope\n\n\nPost offices\nThe main city post office is at the west end of Union Street close to the junction with Holburn Street. There's another in the basement of WH Smith in the St Nicholas Centre. There is a smaller post office in the back of RS McColl on the Castlegate. Post offices are usually open M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa 9AM-12:30PM.\nGolden post boxes honour local winners of gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics: on Castlegate for rower Katherine Grainger, on Golden Square for Paralympic cyclist Neil Fachie, and in the nearby town of Westhill for canoeist Tim Baillie.\n\n\nPlaces of worship\nThere are some 140 active churches in Aberdeen, two mosques, one synagogue and one Buddhist temple.\nThe three cathedrals are St Machar's in Old Aberdeen (Presbyterian, so ecclesiastically it's not a cathedral), St Mary's on Huntly Street (Roman Catholic) and St Andrew's on King Street (Episcopalian).\n\n\nGo next\nSee Aberdeenshire for the full range of castles, scenery, whisky distilleries, golf resorts, and what you will. Some within a day trip are:\n\nStonehaven, a picturesque fishing port 15 miles south, with Dunottar Castle.\nBanchory for Crathes Castle and Ballater for Balmoral.\nCairngorms National Park starts 30 miles west of the city, and its Aberdeenshire side lends itself to day-trips, whereas the Spey Valley side needs a longer stay, e.g. in Aviemore.",
