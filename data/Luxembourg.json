Capital of the Grand Duchy, divided by two deep river valleys   \n2 Clervaux. Small castle town home to the Family of Man photo exposition   \n3 Diekirch. Town known for its World War II history   \n4 Echternach. Small town known for the basilica containing the crypt of Saint Willibrord   \n5 Ettelbruck. Transport hub for northern Luxembourg   \n6 Esch-sur-Alzette. Former mining town now home to the country's university, Luxembourg's second city   \n7 Mondorf-les-Bains. Spa town with casino located on the Luxembourg-France border   \n8 Vianden. Quaint small town presided over by a rather splendid ch\u00e2teau   \n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Esch-sur-S\u00fbre. A very small town built around a hilltop castle. Not far downstream the Lac de la Haute S\u00fbre is found.   \n2 Schengen. The namesake village of the Schengen treaty, located on the border with France and Germany.   \n\n\nUnderstand\n\n Tourism information, 6, rue Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, \u260f +352 428 2821. (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nHistory\nThe city of Luxembourg proper was founded in 963, and its strategic position soon promised it a great future. Luxembourg was at the crossroads of Western Europe and became heavily fortified. You can still see the extensive city walls and towers which form its distinctive cityscape. Due to its key position, Luxembourg became a duchy that once included a much larger territory stretching into present-day Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and France. The powerful Habsburg family kept its hand on it until the late Renaissance times.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Duchy of Luxembourg was granted to the Netherlands. It had a special status as a member of the German confederacy and the citadel was armed with a Prussian garrison. Luxembourg was still a strategic location that everybody sought to control. It was granted the title \"Grand Duchy\" in 1815 but lost some territories to France and Germany.\nDuring the course of the 19th century, developments in warfare and the appearance of artillery made Luxembourg obsolete as a stronghold, and it became little more than a rural territory of no strategic interest. The Germans relinquished their rights over it and moved out their garrison, its western half was granted to Belgium in 1839, and the Netherlands granted it complete independence in 1867. Since then, Luxembourg has developed from a poor country of fields and farms into a modern economy relying on financial services and high-tech industries.\n\nOverrun by Germany in both world wars, Luxembourg was one of the major battlefields of the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944-1945, a story well documented in the museum at Diekirch.  The state ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and it joined NATO the following year. Cooperation among the Benelux countries had already existed after the First World War, but this time it proved to be a lot more important on a European scale. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) and, in 1999, it joined the euro currency area. As most Luxembourgers are fluent in (at least) two languages (French and Luxembourgish/German), and the small country seems non-threatening to most of the EU, Luxembourgers have risen to high ranks in the EU administration. The most notable is Jean Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission from 2014 to 2019.\nLuxembourg's official national motto is called Mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sinn, meaning \"We want to remain what we are\". It refers to the nation's ownership by foreign powers and its wish to remain as an independent state today and in the future.\nIn Jan 2020, it had an estimated population of 626,000.\n\n\nClimate\nLuxembourg enjoys a temperate oceanic climate, with the hills of the Ardennes providing some extra protection against the influences of the Atlantic. The best, or at least the sunniest time to go is May to August, although with a bit of luck you'll enjoy mild weather in April and September too. The warm months of July-August are high-season in the country, with outdoor festivals all around, but Spring comes with many flowers and Autumn comes with wine-making opportunities in the Moselle valley area.\nDespite the small size of the country, there are measurable differences in overall temperature, with the north being generally a few degrees colder and receiving serious packs of snow in winter. Although comparatively mild for this part of Europe, winters are on the cold side for travels, with average temperatures around +2 \u00b0C in January and occasional low points of -15 \u00b0C at night. July and August are the warmest months, with average temperatures between 15 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, and usually a few days over 30 \u00b0C. Annual precipitation is around 780 mm, with highs in August and December.\n\n\nTerrain\nMostly gently rolling uplands with broad, shallow valleys; uplands to slightly mountainous in the north; steep slope down to Moselle flood plain in the south.\n\n\nHolidays\nNational holiday: National Day falls on 23 June (the birthday of Grand Duchess Charlotte moved by 6 months to coincide with the warmer weather).\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Luxembourgish phrasebook, French phrasebook, German phrasebook\nThe three official languages of Luxembourg are Luxembourgish, French and German; Luxembourgers are fluent in all three.\nLuxembourgish is close to German and forms a dialect continuum with the German dialects across the border, but it is not fully mutually intelligible with more faraway German dialects. In informal contexts and when wishing to stress \"Luxembourgishness\", Luxembourgish has been gaining ground since the German occupations during the world wars. Young Luxembourgers increasingly use Luxembourgish when texting or speaking among friends. Written media tends towards standard German or French but the comment sections are often full of Luxembourgish and audiovisual media frequently make use of Luxembourgish at all levels of formality.\nGerman is universally understood, used in the court system, and taught in schools. It is also the predominant language in writing because Luxembourgish was traditionally mostly a spoken language.\nFrench is commonly used throughout the country and can be found on anything from road signs to menus to stores. It's probably the most useful language to know if you want to converse with most people in Luxembourg. However, younger Luxembourgers are turning away from French, as its perceived usefulness on the world stage is increasingly put into question.\nEnglish is almost universally understood and is the most popular foreign language in the country. Educated Luxembourgers are fluent in all four of the above languages; it is the \"frontaliers\" (workers who live across one of the borders) who may not speak English well or at all. Local media frequently use French, Luxembourgish, and German interchangeably without subtitles or voice-over translation, especially when doing street interviews.\nLuxembourg is also home to a strong and vibrant Portuguese population (nearly 100,000 reside there), so knowing Portuguese, while not a prerequisite, can be a plus. A few media outlets also publish local news in Portuguese.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBorder formalities\n\nLuxembourg is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\nIf you're from a country or territory that does not require a visa for the Schengen Area - except for Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Seychelles - you are permitted to work in Luxembourg without having to obtain any authorisation during the period of the 90 day visa-free stay. However, this visa exemption does not necessarily extend to other Schengen countries.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Luxembourg Findel Airport (LUX IATA) (6 km (3.7 mi) outside Luxembourg-City). This airport is connected by Luxair, the national airline, and other carriers from many European destinations. A full timetable is available on the website of the airport. Visitors from airports not directly served can connect to Luxembourg at the hubs in Amsterdam Schiphol (served by KLM), Paris Charles de Gaulle (served by Air France and Luxair), Frankfurt Airport (served by Lufthansa), and London Heathrow (served by British Airways). International flights to Luxembourg with a change in a hub airport are often not much more expensive or even cheaper than flights to the hub itself.   \nFrankfurt-Hahn (HHN IATA), in the German countryside about halfway between Frankfurt and Luxembourg. However, as of June 2024 direct bus services have been cancelled. This airport is mainly served by low-cost carriers such as Ryanair.\nBrussels-South Charleroi (CRL IATA), in Charleroi (about 50 km south of Brussels) is about three hours away by direct Flibco bus. This airport is also mainly served by low-cost carriers.\nFrankfurt Airport (FRA IATA) is a bit further afield. Flexibus has once a day direct bus service to Luxembourg city.\n\n\nBy train\n2 Luxembourg train station. This station opened in 1859 can be reached directly from Paris (2 hours), Metz (1 hour), Brussels (3 hours) and Trier (43 min). Both international and national timetables can be found on the website of the national railways company CFL. Trains from Paris need to be booked in advance at SNCF's website, and have discounts for advanced bookings. Trains from Metz, Brussels, Trier, and other local destinations have neither advance discounts nor the possibility of reserving seats, so there is no advantage of booking these trains in advance.CFL operates a minibus shuttle between Luxembourg train station and TGV Lorraine where passengers can catch TGV connections to Charles de Gaulle Airport, Disneyland Paris, Rennes, Bordeaux and other destinations, and a bus shuttle to Saarbr\u00fccken, where passengers can connect to the German ICE network.   \n\n\nBy car\nMotorways from Metz (A3), Brussels (A6) and Trier (A1) connect to the ring-road around Luxembourg City, from which most other parts of the country can be reached.\nIf you want to enjoy a nice view on your way to the city, \"Grund\" and Kasematten, leave the motorway coming from the East (Germany) at exit \"Cents\". Enter Cents and drive down the hill. Don't let yourself be stopped by signs that the route is blocked via \"Grund\".\n\n\nBy bus\nLuxembourg is served by a number of long-distance intercity buses. These include Flixbus, Regiojet and Flibco. In general, these buses are less convenient than trains as they do not run frequent (often only once per day). However, sometimes they turn out cheaper than trains.\nIn addition, there are commuter buses to nearby places such as Trier and Bitburg in Germany and Bastogne in Belgium.\n\n\nGet around\n\nLuxembourg is a compact country, making it easy to reach nearly any town in the country in an hour or less by public transport. The Mobilit\u00e9it agency coordinates the country's trains and buses; their website and mobile app are both very useful for planning journeys throughout Luxembourg.\nSince 29 February 2020, most public transport in Luxembourg has been free. You only need a ticket for cross-border journeys, or if you wish to travel first class on the train.\n\n\nBy train\nThe Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL) train network is generally a good way to move across the country. Luxembourg city is the main railway hub, from where lines radiate out in all directions. While the south is reasonably well covered, the north is limited to one main line which runs from Luxembourg City to Li\u00e8ge in Belgium via Mersch, Ettelbruck, Clervaux and Troisvierges. Diekirch has a branch line from Ettelbruck, and Wiltz from Kautenbach. To the south, you can reach Bettembourg and Esch-sur-Alzette. To the east, there is a line to Trier in Germany,  which crosses over the Moselle River at Wasserbillig.\nTrains in Luxembourg are comfortable and modern, and generally run perfectly on-time.\n\n\nBy tram\nLuxembourg city re-introduced trams in 2017. The single tram line no. T1 runs from the eastern end of Kirchberg to the district of Bonnevoie. As of 2024, the extension to Stadion is in service, a further extension to the airport is under construction, and a new rapid tram line is also under development, to directly connect Luxembourg City to the second-largest city, Esch-sur-Alzette, and to the university in Belval, by 2032.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe country is served by countless bus services, reaching every little village in the country. Most services run at least every hour throughout the week, with higher frequencies during weekdays and reduced operation on Saturdays and Sundays.\nBuses numbered 1-31 serve the City of Luxembourg, with the most useful when arriving in the country being line 16 (Airport - Kirchberg - City Centre - Train Station - Howald) and 29 (Airport - City Centre - Train Station - Howald). Almost all city buses stop at the central bus station, Hamilius, and the train station (Luxembourg Gare) in their routes at some point, resulting in very high-frequent connections between these places (once every 1 or 2 minutes).\nThe bus service out of town is also extensive and reliable. Buses numbered 100 upwards will take you out of the city. For destinations in the north of the country, one usually first needs to take a train to Mersch, Ettelbruck, Wiltz, or Clervaux, and change there to a bus to the final destination. Other destinations usually have a direct bus from the capital.\nBuses are modern and clean. Screens and announcements on-board advise of the next stop on most bus services. It is advisable to hail the bus you wish to catch by raising your hand towards the road as it arrives.\n\n\nBy car\nLuxembourg's road infrastructure is well-developed. Anywhere that happens to lie along the major motorways is easily accessible via these (including Grevenmacher in the east, Mamer to the west, Bettembourg to the south and Mersch and Ettelbruck in the north). Esch-sur-Alzette, the country's second city (more like a small town by international standards) also has its own motorway link.\nUnless otherwise indicated, speed limits are 50 km/h in towns and villages, 90 km/h outside built-up areas, and 130 km/h on the motorway (110 km/h in the rain). Mind the yellow town/villagge shields which indicate when you enter or leave a town or village. Speed limits are raised by signs to 110 km/h in some places on the N7 and N11, and lowered to 70 km/h on some open country roads. Within towns and villages, speed limits can be raised to 70 km/h on main roads, or lowered to 30 km/h in residential areas. Speed limits are enforced by random police checks as well as fixed speed cams. Be aware that if you have a right-hand-drive car then you are very likely to be singled out for a customs check on the way in. Police are also very keen on stopping drivers for having the 'wrong' lights on in town, i.e. side lights instead of dipped headlights.\nDriving in Luxembourg is nowhere as testing as in some other European countries. The locals are generally polite. When entering the highways from side roads into the slower traffic lane, the other drivers will allow you to join the traffic line, but traffic indicators are essential. As with other highways in Europe always keep in the slow traffic lane, keeping the fast lane for overtaking. Some drivers travel at high speeds and will flash their headlights to indicate that they are in a hurry, even if you are sitting on the speed limit. Most of the time trucks keep in the slow lane at their regulated speed for large vehicles. They can be a little annoying when overtaking other trucks. The truck drivers seem to keep a watch out for other vehicles. Cars towing caravans can be a bit of a menace at times but staying alert will ensure there are no problems. The closing speeds of vehicles need to be watched if overtaking, as some drivers travel well in excess of the speed limits. Speed cameras were introduced in Luxembourg in 2017, and now include both instantaneous speed and average speed cameras, which trigger if the speed limit is exceeded by more than 3 km/h.\nNormal day-to-day driving in Luxembourg is a delight but traffic does slow down in peak times.\nFinding parking in Luxembourg city centre on weekends can be difficult. Most spaces are quickly taken and some parking garages close early. The best option is to find somewhere near the station and then walk around the city centre.\nParking is paid within the entire city (including all residential districts). Traffic wardens are numerous and vigilant.\nPark and Ride (P+R) facilities are also located on the stations named Stadion, Howald gare and Luxexpo of Luxemburg city light rail (line no. T1).\n\n\nBy bike\nThe streets and landscape in Luxembourg make for good cycling territory; highly recommended.\n\n\nSee\nYou may not expect it from one of the smallest countries in Europe, but The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a diverse land, full of beautiful nature and gorgeous historic monuments. Its turbulent history is filled with stories of emperors and counts as well as many battles and disputes. Today, the almost fairy-tale like castles and fortresses are a faint but impressive reminder of those days, and amidst their lovely natural setting, they make some superb and picturesque sights.\n\nMost of the country's population lives in rural areas and apart from the delightful historic City of Luxembourg, the country's capital, settlements are mostly small. That said, the capital is a place not to be missed. It has a splendid location high on a cliff, overlooking the deep and narrow valleys of the Alzette and P\u00e9trusse rivers. Several parts of the old town are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the most interesting places include the Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame, the town fortifications, and of course the Grand Ducal Palace, which is surrounded by charming cobblestoned lanes. However, there's far more to see, such as the Bock casemates, Neum\u00fcnster Abbey and the Place d'Armes. There are several World War II memorial sites and a number of high-end museums, but just wandering through the old centre, taking in the beautiful views from the Chemin de la Corniche and crossing bridges to the nearest plateaus is at least as great a way to discover the city.\n\nThe lively town of Echternach is the oldest city in Luxembourg. It boasts the country's most prominent religious structure, the basilica of the Abbey of Echternach where the country's patron St Willibrord is buried. The annual Whit Tuesday celebrations in his honour involve lots of dancers in the old town centre and are a popular tourist attraction. Apart from its own sights, Echternach makes a great base to explore the beautiful M\u00fcllerthal, better known as \"Little Switzerland\". Hike or bike through its dense forests with myriad streams and even some caves.\n\nThe romantic village of Vianden with its stunning medieval castle is a tourists' favourite and well worth a visit even despite the crowds in summer. The beautiful location of the fortress in the Our river valley, surrounded by tight forests and a lake with swans, gives it a typical fairy-tale castle look and feel. If you're done wandering the streets and exploring the Gothic churches and fortified towers of this charming town, visit the Victor Hugo house. Afterwards, the pleasant caf\u00e9s of the Grand Rue are a perfect place to kick back and enjoy.\nHead to Remich to start your own trip down the Route du Vin and discover the many fine wines that are produced here, in the Moselle Valley.\n\n\nDo\nLuxembourg has many excellent well-marked outdoor trails. Their location and GPS tracks can be found at G\u00e9oportail.lu\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Luxembourgeoise de Teqball has a list of public places for playing teqball, a sport invented in the 2010s by three Hungarians, that is a combination of table tennis and football (or soccer) played with a special curved table.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nLuxembourg uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\nIf you know any coin collectors, take a few local coins as keepsakes, since Luxembourg coins are among the rarest of the euros \u2014 even in Luxembourg, most of your change will be in other countries' coins!\nThe general price level in Luxembourg is noticeably higher than in France and Germany, especially in central Luxembourg.  Even cheap hotels tend to cost over \u20ac100 a night and you won't get much change from \u20ac20 after a modest dinner and a drink. To save some money, basing yourself in Trier (or other cities across the border) and daytripping to Luxembourg might be an option.\nOn the upside, cigarettes, alcohol and petrol are comparatively cheap, making the small state a popular destination for long-haul drivers.\n\n\nEat\n\nTraditional dishes are largely based on pork and potatoes and the influence of German cooking is undeniable.  The unofficial national dish is judd mat gaardebounen, or smoked neck of pork served with boiled broad beans. A must to try if you do get the opportunity are gromperekichelchen (literally, potato biscuits) which are a type of fried shredded potato cake containing onions, shallots and parsley. Typically found served at outdoor events such as markets or funfairs they are absolutely delicious and a particularly nice snack on a cold winter's day.\nIn most restaurants, however, the typical local food would be French cuisine coming in bigger portions. Italian food has been popular since the 1960s. Home cooking has been greatly influenced by the recipes of Ketty Thull, apparently the best-selling cooking and baking book in Luxembourg since WWII.\nYou can also taste the \"Bamkuch\" (literally tree cake), which is eaten mainly during celebrations such as weddings and baptisms. This cake is traditionally made on a spit and presented as a tree trunk composed of several layers, visible when it is cut, and that represent the tree rings.\n\n\nDrink\nThe Luxembourg white wines from the Moselle valley to the east of Luxembourg include Riesling, Auxerrois, Pinot Gris, Pinot Blanc, Rivaner and Elbling, and are good. In autumn, many villages along the Moselle river organise wine-tasting village festivals.\nYoung people tend to drink local or imported beer. Luxembourg has a number of breweries, with Diekirch, from the town of the same name, Bofferding, Battin, Simon and Mousel being the most popular. Despite the fact that you would be hard pushed to find any of these outside of the country, all are excellent lagers.\nAs an after dinner digestive, Luxembourgers like to drink an eau-de-vie. The most commonly available are Mirabelle and Quetsch. Both are made from plums and are extremely strong! Sometimes these are taken in coffee which may be a little more palatable for some.\n\n\nSleep\nDue to the heavy banking and EU presence in the city, hotels in central Luxembourg are quite expensive, although there is a good youth hostel (see Luxembourg (city)#Sleep).  It may be more cost-effective to stay across the border in Trier, for example, and \"commute\" into Luxembourg.\nThe Association of Independent Hotels in Luxembourg operates a booking service at hotels.lu [1] for a number of smaller hotels, mostly in the countryside, but a few in the city.\n\n\nWork\n\nLuxembourg is a major player in the financial service sector. Many thousands of people commute from neighbouring Belgium, France (Les frontaliers) and Germany (Die Grenzg\u00e4nger) on weekdays, considerably swelling the population of the capital city. The majority work in the numerous financial institutions based in and around the capital (particularly in the Kirchberg district) and are drawn across the borders by the excellent salaries on offer. Luxembourg City has a very international flavour as in addition to les frontaliers, it attracts young professionals from all over the globe. In this area, business is done predominantly in English, French or German and it is necessary to be fluent in one of these at a minimum, although many jobs will demand proficiency in at least two.\n\n\nStay safe\nIn many surveys, Luxembourg has been named \"safest country in the world\". If you follow usual precautions, you should be fine, however, there are some hints that you might want to consider while staying in Luxembourg.\n\n\nDodgy areas and crime\nWhile most of the hereafter mentioned areas are perfectly safe in broad daylight, there are some areas that are sketchier under certain circumstances, for example late at night or if travelling alone.\n\n\nRailway stations\nIn the bigger towns and settlements, crime tends to concentrate at and in the streets around railway stations, particularly harassment, pickpocketing or drug offences. In the south, this is especially the case in Luxembourg city, and in the urban areas in the canton Esch/Alzette.\nIn the northern parts of the country, railway stations are mostly located in smaller villages and towns, and are therefore mostly safe at any time of the day, with the exception perhaps of Ettelbruck.\n\n\nLuxembourg City\nIn Luxembourg City, crime tends to concentrate at nighttime around the central railway station (Quartier Gare), and in Bonnevoie. The most common offences are harassment, pickpocketing or drug offences, with sporadic muggings happening.\nNote that since 2020 there has been a series of cases of necklace- and watch-snatching. Avoid therefore to wear flashy or expensive looking jewellery in the mentioned areas.\n\n\nMinette\nThe urban areas of the Minette region have a reputation for being sketchier at night. Follow usual precautions around railway stations.\n\n\nRural areas\nOutside of the bigger towns and railway hubs, the rural areas and villages, such as in the north, west and east of the country, are very safe at any time of the day. Violent crime is virtually nonexistent.\n\n\nNature\nEnjoying the nature of Luxembourg is a pleasant way to relax, if you keep basic precautions in mind.\n\n\nTerrain\nWhile hiking, it is advised to stay on marked paths if you are unfamiliar with the terrain.\nIn the Ardennes, and especially in the M\u00fcllerthal region, it is not uncommon to encounter steep cliffs with drops of up to 30 m in the middle of the forest, sometimes only steps away from the hiking paths without being imminently visible.\nAnother problem in these regions might be slippery rocks, especially after rainfall.\nTo reduce these risks when hiking in the Ardennes and M\u00fcllerthal, leave the flipflops at home and make sure to have appropriate footwear.\nSeveral tourists are injured each year because of unprepared expeditions in these regions, with some cases even having resulted in death.\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe greatest danger you will encounter while out in nature are ticks and the diseases they transmit, most notably the lyme disease, with infection rates being as high as 20% in some areas of Luxembourg. \nBefore setting off into nature, make sure to inform yourself on how to protect yourself, how to remove ticks from your skin and how to recognize a lyme disease infection in the period after you have been bitten.\n\n\nStay healthy\nThe food and tap water supply in Luxembourg is perfectly fine and the country's healthcare system is first class. The climate is average even though the summers can get hot. However these temperatures rarely rise much above 30 \u00b0C.\n\n\nRespect\nTry to show respect for the local language and make some effort to say a word or two of it even if just the standard greeting \"Moien\". The locals, especially those in the small towns and villages, are very friendly; saying \"Hello\" to them in any language will be returned with a smile.\nUnusual for a country in Western Europe, Luxembourgers place a high emphasis on family values. It's not uncommon for people in small towns and villages to know each other on a personal level, and parents are intimately involved in the life choices of their children. \nLuxembourgers are their own people with a distinct national identity. They are neither Germans, Belgians, nor French; calling a Luxembourger either of these demonstrates ignorance. Similarly, do not compare Luxembourg to its neighbours. \nLuxembourgers, like many people living in Europe, are direct communicators, but they are tactful and diplomatic with their choice of words. This said, being overly blunt or opinionated is considered rude. Subtlety is more valued than being direct. \nThe pace of life in Luxembourg is much slower compared to other countries in Europe. Building relationships and getting things done require you to demonstrate sincere interest as Luxembourgers try to do things in a careful, measured manner.\nDo not put your emotions on display. Exhibiting impatience, as well as confrontational behaviour, will push you away from people. Again, Luxembourgers try to do things in a careful, measured manner.\nLuxembourgers value their privacy. They do not ask personal questions and take a dim view of people who intrude on their privacy. Personal matters \u2015 for example, finances, religion, and politics \u2015 are private matters and are not discussed openly, even among close friends. \nLuxembourgers value humility. Bragging or boasting about your accomplishments won't be well received. Let go of the need to prove yourself or show off your accomplishments; how you treat other people is more important.  \nWhile it's debated whether or not Luxembourgish is a variety of another language, many Luxembourgers proudly consider it to be a language in its own right and will be offended if you insinuate something otherwise.\nThe Grand Duke and his family are venerated in Luxembourgish society. Insulting or criticising them may cause offense.\n\n\nConnect\nEuropean roaming has been introduced. It allows all SIM card holders belonging to one of the European member countries to maintain the same pricing conditions as in the country of origin.\nTelephone calls and Internet browsing are valid without additional cost in all European countries, unless authorized by national authorities (generally minor operators) or exceeding a Gbit data threshold which increases from year to year. To use this service, simply activate the roaming option on your mobile phone.\nThe participating countries are those of the European Union (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Romania, United Kingdom, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden), those of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and certain overseas territories (Azores, Canary Islands, Gibraltar, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Madeira, Martinique, Mayotte, Reunion, Saint-Martin).",
