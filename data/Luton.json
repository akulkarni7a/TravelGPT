  "extract": "Luton is a large town in Bedfordshire, some 35 mi (56 km) north of London. It's a multicultural town with a population of about 200,000.  It used to have a straw and hat-making trade, hence \"The Hatters\" nickname of Luton football club; a couple of factories remain along the Old Bedford Road. Luton later produced Vauxhall cars and Whitbread beers, but little of these remain. Most people only come here for London Luton Airport, a major hub for budget & charter flights. The airport is described below but the focus of this page is the town itself.\nLuton's Tourist Information Centre has helpfully been placed 5 miles (8.0 km) from town, in Dunstable, so little good it will do you.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 London Luton Airport (LTN  IATA). Luton is London's fourth airport, 35 miles north of the city. It's a major hub for the budget airlines easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air, and for charter flights by Tui (formerly Thomsons). This means it particularly feels the peaks and troughs of holiday travel: Easter here can be chaotic. Most flights are to Europe, plus a few to Tel Aviv, the Gulf states and the Red Sea resorts. UK flights are to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Inverness and Belfast. See below for transport, and allow extra time because the access routes and parking lots are still being excavated. However, building work on the interior is complete for the time being. There are a couple of cafes and an exchange desk ground side, then a large retail and waiting area in airside departures, plus a multi-faith prayer room. Exchange kiosks are run by ICE: they don't display their rates, but these are about 25% off the official rate for major currencies - poor but average for a UK airport. \"Duty-free\" liquor is 10% more expensive than UK supermarket prices. Consider printing your boarding pass even if it's on your phone, as mobile / Wifi coverage is scratchy within the terminal building; you can use airport Wifi (non-secure) free for up to 4 hours.   (updated Apr 2019)\n\nFor public transport to central London see Luton Airport. It's a choice between a train (shuttle bus to Luton Airport Parkway then train to London St Pancras), or a bus from the airport to London Victoria.\nLocal buses: Arriva Bus A runs every 15 mins between the airport and Luton town railway station (15 mins) and Dunstable (30 mins). Bus 100 runs every 30 mins to Hitchin and Stevenage.\n\n\nFrom other London airports\nFrom the other London airports, it may be quicker to use the inter-airport transfer bus then come into Luton on the town bus, rather than travel into central London then out again. \nNational Express runs from Heathrow Airport (LHR IATA) (all terminals) to Luton Airport every 30 mins; non-stop Bus 707 takes 50 mins, Bus 787 via Hemel Hempstead takes 70 mins. Fares are demand priced, \u00a318-30 single. \nSome of these buses start from Gatwick Airport (LGW IATA), but the direct trains (Brighton-Bedford) are much quicker for the same fare. National Express Bus 777 runs between Stansted Airport (STN IATA) and Luton Airport every hour or so via Hitchin and Stevenage, journey time 90 min, single fare \u00a316.\n\n\nBy train\nLuton has three railway stations, one in the town centre, one close to the airport and one towards the north of the town.\n2 Luton Station.

Single from \u00a335. \n\n\nStay safe\nGenerally, if you keep your wits about you, you should not run in to any great trouble. Do avoid travelling on your own between midnight and 4am, as drunk people are often looking for fights. If a drunk makes a gesture towards you it is best to ignore them and keep walking. If you have been on a night out it is safest to get a licensed taxi, of which there are plenty.\nIt is not advised to wear a Watford FC shirt in town, especially in evenings or on Saturdays. Despite lacking the great success and history of the Hatters, Watford are considered rivals of Luton Town FC, and Watford shirts are by no means inconspicuous (their team colour is bright yellow). Wearing a Watford shirt is unlikely to attract more than verbal abuse but could turn ugly if you are not careful. It is similarly not advised to wear a Millwall FC shirt in Luton.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nGo next\nLuton is very well-placed for travelling to many other interesting places.\n\nLondon is a 30-40 minute train journey away.\nWhipsnade Zoo, just outside Dunstable.",
