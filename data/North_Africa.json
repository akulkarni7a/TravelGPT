  "extract": "In North Africa (also known as Maghreb), beautiful mosques, bustling markets, and ancient ruins lie between the Mediterranean coast and the Sahara Desert. It has an ancient history, with many Berber kingdoms as well as the Greek, Roman, and Ottoman empires ruling there.\n\n\nCountries\n\n\nOther territories\nAtlantic Ocean Islands: Canary Islands (Spain) and Madeira Islands (Portugal) are integrated provinces of their respective countries\nBi'r Taw\u012bl \u2013 an unclaimed piece of land between Egypt and Sudan, with virtually zero infrastructure whatsoever. It's one of only three unclaimed territories, with the other two being Marie Byrd Land and Liberland.\nSpanish North Africa: Ceuta, Melilla, and some smaller territories along the coast of Morocco\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Alexandria \u2014 Egypt's major Mediterranean city is a pale shadow of its former glorious self but remains a major tourism site\n2 Algiers \u2014  the capital of Algeria with a notable medieval casbah\n3 Cairo \u2014 the largest city in North Africa with major monuments of Ancient Egypt nearby\n4 Casablanca \u2014 the largest city in Morocco is of sparse interest to the traveller, but is a major transit point\n5 El Aai\u00fan \u2014 the capital city  of the disputed territory of Western Sahara\n6 Marrakech \u2014 this historic Moroccan city close to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains is an extraordinary meeting of the ancient and modern\n7 Oran \u2014 this historic Algerian city is full of French, Ottoman, Moorish, and Algerian architecture like churches and mosques and parks. It also has a beautiful seashore and buildings.\n8 Tripoli \u2014 Libya's capital was long off-limits to most travellers but is experiencing a real resurgence of interest\n9 Tunis \u2014 the capital of Tunisia is a relatively small and sleepy city but is the gateway to the remains of Carthage and other very notable historical sites.\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Abu Simbel  \u2014 a very remote area in far south Egypt, with some beautiful ancient temples\n2 Carthage \u2014 Phoenician colony in Tunisia and the biggest trade metropolis of the antique world; famously razed by the Romans and the remnants are now encased in a museum\n3 El-Oued  \u2014 in Algeria with its domed architecture & nearby Grand Erg Oriental \u2014 the Sahara's second largest dune field\n4 Ghat - an ancient settlement in southwest Libya with prehistoric rock paintings and very challenging desert trekking\n High Atlas \u2014  hiking, skiing and Berber culture amongst these peaks and valleys in Morocco.\n5 Leptis Magna \u2014 extensive Roman ruins in Libya\n6 Matmata \u2014 desert village in Tunisia of cave abodes, where Star Wars's Tatooine was filmed\n7 Merzouga and M'Hamid \u2014 from either of these two settlements in Morocco at the edge of the Sahara, ride a camel or 4x4 into the desert for a night (or a week) among the dunes and under the stars\n8 Valley of the Kings \u2014 the great site of Ancient Egypt\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nNorth Africa, as a region, is very different from the countries to the South.  The people and culture are Arabic, the food is different, and Islam is the dominant religion.  Many organizations now group North Africa and the Middle East together as MENA (Middle East North Africa) because North Africa has much more in common with countries like Syria or Jordan than countries like Mali or Ivory Coast.\n\n\nHistory\nThe North African peoples have seen many empires come and go, each bringing both wars, and contributions to local culture. Ancient Egypt was one of the world's longest-living urban civilizations, and Phoenicia, ancient Greece and later the Roman Empire came to dominate the Mediterranean Sea. The Arabs and Islam arrived in the 7th century (see Islamic Golden Age) and were displaced by the Ottoman Empire. The French colonial empire came to include Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and had the Suez Canal completed in 1869, while Egypt became part of the British Empire in 1882 following the Anglo-Egyptian War. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, Libya would become part of the Italian Empire. During World War II in Africa, the Italians and later the Germans failed to conquer the whole of North Africa. After the war, Arab nationalist movements demanded independence. The North African countries took different paths to independence, and in the 2020s only a few coastal territories of Spanish North Africa are under European rule.\nNorth Africa was a scene for the Cold War with mostly authoritarian leaders, with allegiance either to  the West or the Soviet Union. In 2010, the Arab Spring began as a series of public revolts. As of 2020, the outcome has been varied, with Tunisia adopting a democratic constitution, and Libya stuck in civil war.\n\n\nTalk\nArabic is without a doubt the dominant language, and is the official language in every North African country. However Arabic dialects are mutually unintelligible, so there's no way a tourist speaking standard Arabic could understand a Moroccan speaking their dialect. However, standard Arabic is always the official language, and well-educated people will be able to speak it.\nFrench is the most widely known second language in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, due to much of the area's history as a French colony. In Libya and Egypt, English is the dominant second language (except among older Libyans, where Italian is more prevalent).\nMany people in North Africa, especially in Algeria and Morocco, speak an Amazigh language (also known as Berber, although that term should be avoided) as their mother tongue.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy boat\nThere are some ferries from Italy (notably Sicily), Spain, and Gibraltar \u2013 see Ferries in the Mediterranean\u200e. \n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\nThe North African cuisine has a lot in common with the Middle Eastern cuisine.\n\n\nDrink\nArabic coffee, which involves adding cardamom to flavour the coffee, is popular throughout North Africa.\n\n\nStay safe\nAvoid drinking untreated ground water. Avoid Libya, southern Algeria, the Sahrawi areas of Western Sahara, and southern Tunisia due to the risk of armed conflict or insurgent violence.\n\n\nGo next",
