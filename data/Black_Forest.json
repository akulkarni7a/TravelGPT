  "extract": "The Black Forest (German: Schwarzwald) is located in the southwest corner of Germany in the federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which contains the namesake low, forested mountain range and warm, sunny lowlands at its foot. It is known as one of Germany's most beautiful and favourite destinations. There is both nature and history to be found, and thanks to unique climatic conditions in the middle of the European landmass, those can be enjoyed year-round with some of the warmest temperatures in Germany.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThis ancient forest is famous for its legends and the black fir trees that dot the landscape. While not particularly high, the mountains offer a wonderful place to go hiking or mountain biking. There are a few skiing resorts as well offering average but crowded conditions. Better to head south to the Alps if you are a serious skier or boarder.\nThe Black Forest is a mountainous terrain at about 200\u20131,500 m (660\u20134,920 ft) above sea level, the highest point being the Feldberg (the field mountain) at 1,493 m (4,898 ft). The region managed by the Black Forest Tourism Board extends beyond the mountains and includes attractions like the Europa-Park and the Kaiserstuhl hills in the Upper Rhine Plain as well as the surrounding cities.\nThe region is famous for its cuckoo clocks, watchmaking, skiing and hiking. There is a large high-tech light engineering industry in the region stemming from the silver-mining and watchmaking days.\nThe most important destination in the Schwarzwald is called, interestingly, Titisee, which is a medium-sized lake with associated tourist village (Titisee-Neustadt) and hotels, with very nice views and generally very relaxed and healthy activities. From here it is a short journey to Lake Constance and the city of Konstanz, or to see the Rhein Waterfall at Neuhausen in Switzerland.\n\n\nDestinations\n\n\nCities, towns and villages\n\n \n\n1 Baden-Baden \u2014 world-famous spa town\n2 Bad S\u00e4ckingen\n3 Bad Wildbad\n4 Baiersbronn \u2014 famous for hiking and Michelin star rated restaurants\n5 Bonndorf im Schwarzwald - famous for its Shrovetide museum\n6 Calw\n7 Emmendingen\n8 Freiburg \u2014 considered the \"Jewel of the Black Forest\"\n9 Furtwangen im Schwarzwald \u2014 famous for clock-making, and is home to a clock museum\n10 Gengenbach\n11 Gersbach\n12 H\u00e4usern\n13 Kehl\n14 Laufenburg\n15 L\u00f6rrach\n16 Offenburg \u2014 the capital of the wine region Ortenau\n17 Pforzheim \u2014 the \"Gateway to Black Forest\"\n18 Rastatt\n19 Rottweil \u2014 the oldest town in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, famous for its colourful carneval festival\n20 Schiltach\n21 Sch\u00f6nwald Im Schwarzwald \u2014 where the cuckoo clock was invented in 1737\n22 Titisee-Neustadt\n23 Triberg Im Schwarzwald\n24 Villingen-Schwenningen \u2014 traditional stronghold of the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht\n25 Weil am Rhein\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Europa Park \u2014 a theme park, the largest in Germany, and the second most popular in Europe, following Disneyland Paris\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe only airport with scheduled services in the Black Forest region is the Baden-Airpark (FKB IATA) near Baden-Baden. Other airports in neighbouring regions include:\n\nEuroairport between Basel, Switzerland and Mulhouse, France (multiple IATA codes including (EAP IATA) - officially also serving Freiburg in the Black Forest but, in reality, 70 km (43 mi) away\nBodensee-Airport of Friedrichshafen,\nStuttgart Airport, (STR IATA) with a number of domestic and international connections within Europe\nFrankfurt Airport, (FRA IATA) a major international and intercontinental hub, with good fast train connections\nZurich Airport (ZRH IATA) in Switzerland, also well-served and well-connected\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe region is covered by regional trains and buses. As they can be infrequent, it is better to check the departure times in advance (e.g., through bahn.de or some public transport apps).\nIf you stay in a guest house or a hotel, you will often be offered a free \"G\u00e4stekarte\" (guest card), called KONUS. It allows you to go around freely in many local trains and buses (which do not include the express trains \"IC/EC\" and the high speed trains \"ICE\"). It is valid during your whole stay, from you arrival and including the day of your check-in, so it allows visiting the region by going from one accommodation to another without paying any transportation ticket. It includes the following zones (a map is available through the link above):\n\nTarifverbund Ortenau\nRegio-Verkehrsverbund Freiburg\nRegio-Verkehrsverbund L\u00f6rrach\nWaldshuter Tarifverbund\nVerkehrsverbund Schwarzwald-Baar-Heuberg\nVerkehrsgemeinschaft Freudenstadt\nVerkehrsgesellschaft B\u00e4derkreis Calw\nParts of Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund\nYou will only need to show it with a photo ID to the driver or the train staff.\n\n\nSee\n\nThe city of Freiburg, a historic university city, well known as the driest, warmest, sunniest part of Germany.\nDrive on the Schwarzwaldhochstra\u00dfe, a scenic road which runs through the Black Forest between Freudenstadt and Baden-Baden.\nVisit the Mummelsee, a small lake along the Hochstra\u00dfe\nThe Deutsches Uhrenmuseum at Furtwangen along the Schwarzwaldhochstra\u00dfe, the biggest collection of Black Forest and Cuckoo clocks.\nThe extraordinarily well-preserved medieval Cistercian monastery Kloster Maulbronn near Pforzheim is a UNESCO World Heritage site\n\n\nDo\n\nHiking\nWater sports\nHigh altitude lake diving\nSkiing & snowboarding (December to March in the higher regions)\nMountain biking\nParagliding\nVisit a medieval mine (\"Schaubergwerk\")\n\n\nBuy\nBuy authentic \"Schwarzw\u00e4lder Kuckucksuhren\".\n\n\nTalk\nMost Germans have learned some English at school, so you should be able to get by. Due to the closeness of France and the long-standing German-French treaty of friendship, French is widely taught in secondary schools, but outcomes vary widely. Tourism industry businesses like Europapark that attract significant numbers of French people will however cater to French speakers as best they can, including a Bastille Day parade. An advertisement campaign (\"Wir k\u00f6nnen alles au\u00dfer Hochdeutsch\") poked fun at the propensity of Baden W\u00fcrttemberger to speak with a strong dialect, but standard German will be understood and is taught in schools.\n\n\nEat\n\nThe food tends to be wholesome, heavy dishes and lots of cakes, biscuits, meats and gravies. Perhaps the most internationally renowned is the Schwarzw\u00e4lder Kirschtorte, the Black Forest gateau, a moist chocolate cake with fermented cherries and a hearty dose of whipped cream and chocolate shavings.\nEating out in nice restaurants can be expensive, with a meal for two cost ranging from \u20ac40 to \u20ac150 including drinks. Village inns tend to be cheaper than their counterparts in towns and cities. But bargains can be found, with many Kebab and Turkish-style pizzerias offering items under \u20ac5. Or shop at the local grocery store for fresh baguettes, meat, and cheese. Groceries are inexpensive, with a variety of fruit juices available at a reasonable price (there are cherry, apple, grape, orange, banana, even sauerkraut juice in nice tetrapak containers, a liter is under \u20ac1). In the south Schwarzwald, look for stores Lidl, Aldi, and Pennymarkt for the best food values.\nThe Black Forest area has a number awarded restaurants with the small village of Baiersbronn having Germany's highest density of star rated restaurants. Other notable restaurants can be found in B\u00fchl and Freiburg.\n\n\nDrink\nSome of Germany's best beers and wines are produced in the region. Beer is one of Germany's top drinks and is spread widely in the Black Forest as well. Some of the most common beers are from Rothaus and Alpirsbacher.\n\n\nSleep\nAccommodation in the main tourist areas may be cheaper than many of the quaint smaller towns and villages. For a nice hut at a reasonable price, look for a privately-operated Gasthaus, which can be found in villages throughout the area. There are many pleasant surprises waiting, often with excellent home-cooked food and special service, often provided by the family living there for many generations. Ask at the local Tourist Bureau for a list, often with prices. Sometimes the Tourist office will even call to ask availability.\nGasthaus rooms may be found for as low as \u20ac20 for one person, up to \u20ac70 for a double room/two persons. Reservations may be needed during festivals or summer near tourist locations. Mid-price Hotels begin at \u20ac50-100 a night per double room, with lots of availability in the mid and expensive categories.\nThe Black Forest area has some of the best hiking options, with well-marked trails, and maps available from the tourist offices. Some Germans even spend a week or two hiking with their backpack, with primitive lodging available in small cabins along the trails (must be reserved in advance through the Forstamt office).\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nGo next\nBertha Benz Memorial Route \u2014 follow the tracks of the world's first return car journey back in 1888 from Pforzheim in the Black Forest to Mannheim\nSchwaben cultural region and enjoy some Sp\u00e4tzle egg noodles in this picturesque adjoining region that joins Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with Bavaria.",
