  "extract": "Houston is a sprawling port city in Southeastern Texas. An oil boom and continuing international immigration has brought explosive growth to the city, and it is now the fifth largest metropolitan area in the United States and the most diverse large city since 2021. While at first glance, the city appears to be a 9-5 central business district surrounded by a sea of suburbs and strip malls, there are many hidden gems to be discovered.\n\n\nDistricts\nUntil 1915 the city was subdivided into \"wards\" and they tended to have distinct populations; the names survived in neighborhoods centered around similar areas. Since 1915 continual sprawl has created new districts and neighborhoods, some with distinct characters.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nHouston has a character that, while very \"Texan,\" is also a great melting pot of many cultures and socio-economic groups. You'll find well-to-do suburban mansions, LA-style shopping strips, Latin-American neighborhoods, towering skyscrapers, historic African-American neighborhoods fighting off gentrification, massive refinery complexes, large Asian communities, and pockets of artist communities. From October to May, the weather is relatively pleasant, and many restaurants and bars take advantage of it with plenty of outdoor seating and beautiful lighting. Houston's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also makes it a lush, tropical paradise compared to the rest of Texas.\nIn a sense, Houston is the gritty step-cousin of wealthy Dallas and middle-class hippie Austin. You won't see many cowboys or giant hairdos in downtown Houston (outside of Rodeo season), but you will see a quite diverse mix of people servicing the oilmen, petroleum engineers and high-end doctors.\nHouston is the largest city in the United States without any appreciable zoning.  While there is some small measure of zoning in the form of ordinances, deed restrictions, and land use regulations, real estate development in Houston is only constrained by the will and the pocketbook of real estate developers.  Traditionally, Houston politics and law are strongly influenced by real estate developers; at times, the majority of city council seats have been held by them. This arrangement has made Houston a very sprawled-out and very automobile-dependent city. The benefit of this lack of zoning is that some neighborhoods like Montrose contain a plethora of hidden bars and art galleries nestled among historic neighborhoods - an arrangement not possible in zoned cities across the country.\nFor one desiring a walkable visit, the areas close to downtown are gradually becoming more dense and walkable as islands of trendy mixed-use developments pop up. Many areas can be downright hostile to pedestrians and bikers as sidewalks are privately built (if at all) and roads are littered with massive potholes. The city is primarily built on the energy industry and nearly everyone owns a car and drives everywhere they go, even to a destination less than a mile away.\nWith a few exceptions, almost everything to see or do is in Houston's urban core inside the 610 Loop and more specifically in between downtown, the Galleria, and the Texas Medical Center.\n\n\nVisitor information\nThe Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau operates the Houston Visitors Center.  The center is in the heart of downtown Houston at 901 Bagby (corner of Bagby and Walker St.), on the first floor of the historic City Hall.  Find information on Houston's history, attractions, restaurants, hotels, directions, maps, purchase Houston merchandise and watch an 11-minute film on Houston.  You'll find over 10,000 brochures and magazines to help plan your visit to the Houston area. The center is open Monday - Saturday, 9AM to 4PM\n\n\nClimate\n\nHouston's climate generally ranges from a hot humid summer to a mild winter. The months of October to April make for fantastic times to visit to avoid the heat.  Visitors from areas with mild summers or dry climates should be extremely careful if planning to travel there in the summer months, especially around August.  The combination of high heat and thick humidity can result in stifling and oppressive weather.  It's by no means \"a dry heat\"!  Even some lifelong residents of Houston complain about the August weather. If visiting in the summer, stay hydrated and try to limit outdoor exposure during the hours between 10AM and 7PM.  The nights are very hot too, but not as dangerously hot as during the day. Visitors from cooler, drier places will be amazed at the tolerance levels of some of the locals.  You can see people wearing long sleeve shirts, boots and jeans when the temperature is above 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) and dew points above 70\u00b0F.  But it can not be stressed enough: this place is extremely hot and if you're not prepared or used to this type of heat, you're in for one rude awakening.  But have fun!\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nSee also: Air travel in the US\nHouston is served by two major commercial airports and two smaller regional airports (QHO  IATA) (IATA code for all Houston area airports).\nThe large airports for commercial traffic are:\n\n1 George Bush Intercontinental Airport, (IAH IATA). The larger of the two airports and is 23 miles (37 km) north of downtown near Beltway 8, between IH-45 North and US-59 North. It is the second largest hub for United Airlines and it serves 24 domestic and international airlines.\nMETRO bus line 102 departing from Terminal C runs to downtown, which it reaches in 1 hr 10 min for $1.25. From downtown, the easiest place to catch the bus is the Downtown Transit Center station of the METRORail. During the day, the bus runs approximately every 30 minutes. Be aware the bus stop at terminal C is exposed to the elements and subject to extreme heat, sun, and rain. The stop is on a traffic island three lanes from the door. Check the schedule and then wait indoors by the window for your bus. Step outside 5-7 min before the scheduled departure time.\nRental cars are off site at the IAH Car Rental Center. Frequent dedicated buses shuttle passengers, taking 5-7 minutes to travel between a given terminal and the IAH Car Rental Center.\n2 William P. Hobby Airport (HOU  IATA) (7 mi (11 km) south of downtown off of I-45 South). Hobby's main carrier is Southwest Airlines, and it also served by Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Via Air. Hobby's flights are mostly domestics, but Southwest has limited services to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.  The airport is convenient if you're traveling downtown or south of the city, such as to Galveston. METRO Bus 40 trundles to downtown Houston every 30 minutes, taking about an hour.  The vast majority of visitors opt to rent a car or take an Uber/taxi.   (updated Jun 2024)\n\n\nPrivate aviation\nHouston offers 27 airports within 50 miles, and although William Hobby is the most popular choice for private charter flights, there are several airports that focus on serving the business and luxury aviation community. Air charter companies including Tavaero, Houston Private Jet Rental, and Houston Jet Charter offer access to planes based at airports across Houston, ranging from twin-engine aircraft and light jets to luxury Gulfstreams and executive airliners.\n\n3 Sugar Land Regional Airport, (SGR IATA).

The airport, formerly known as Clover Field, is managed by Texas Aviation Partners, LLC.\nConroe-North Houston Regional Airport (FAA LID: CXO). It's about 37 miles north of downtown Houston near I-45 and U.S. 105 in Conroe, Texas. Formerly known as Lone Star Executive, CXO is popular for international business jets, with a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Federal Inspection Station on-site to serve international business travelers.\nHouston-Southwest Airport (FAA LID: AXH). It's 15 miles (24 km) southwest of downtown Houston in Arcola, Texas, near State Highway 6 (SH 6), the South Freeway (SH 288), and the Fort Bend Parkway.\nWest Houston Airport (IWS  IATA). 15 miles west of downtown Houston on TX 6, just north of I-10. About 100,000 flight operations per year.\n\n\nBy train\nAmtrak, 902 Washington Ave.  Amtrak's Sunset Limited line is the only passenger train route with a stop in Houston on its way between New Orleans and Los Angeles (via San Antonio) three times a week. There is a daily Thruway Bus (operated by Lone Star Coach) that provides a direct connection from the Houston Amtrak station to the Texas Eagle in Longview.\n\n\nBy car\nHouston's major highways include:\n\n I-10 West (\"Katy Freeway\"): from San Antonio\n I-10 East: (\"Baytown/East Freeway\", not to be confused with \"Eastex freeway\") from Beaumont\n I-45 North (\"North Freeway\"): from Dallas\n I-45 South (\"Gulf Freeway\"): from Galveston\n &  US Hwy 59 South (\"Southwest Freeway\"): from Victoria; signed as US 59 south of Rosenberg\n &  US Hwy 59 North (\"Eastex Freeway\"): from Lufkin; signed as US 59 north of Cleveland\n I-610 (\"The Loop\"): loops around downtown (innermost beltway)\n US Hwy 290 West (\"Northwest Freeway\"): from Austin\n SH-249 North (\"Tomball Parkway\"): from Tomball\n SH 288 South (\"South Freeway\"): from Freeport\n SH 225 East (\"Pasadena Freeway\"): from La Porte\n &  BW-8/Beltway 8 (\"The Beltway/Sam Houston Tollway\"): loop about twice as far out as IH-610.\n Grand Parkway: Houston's third beltway, about 10 miles further out than Beltway 8 (Sam Houston)\nApproximate distance from nearby cities (in miles):\n\nAustin: 160\n Baton Rouge, LA: 270\nBeaumont: 90\nDallas: 240\nEl Paso: 745\nGalveston: 50\n Lake Charles, LA: 140\n New Orleans, LA: 350\nSan Antonio: 200\nWaco: 180\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: Long-distance bus travel in the United States\nBuses connect Houston to Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Baton Rouge and other cities in the southeastern U.S. to as far as North Carolina, Chicago and Florida in the U.S. Northbound buses from Mexico typically cross through Brownsville/Matamoros, Laredo/Nuevo Laredo or McAllen/Reynosa. Bus companies have many terminals and stops in different parts of the city.

(updated Feb 2018)\nGreater Heights (North), 1829 Airline Dr\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy car\nHouston's major highways make getting around the city fairly easy. (See list of freeways under the \"Get in\" section.)  Obstacles, however, can make driving in Houston a less than pleasant experience.  One is construction, which seems to be ever-present, and the other is traffic.  Evening rush hour in Houston begins as early as 4PM and can last more than 2 hours.  Morning rush hour is between 7 and 9AM.  During rush hour, traffic on the highways can come to a halt.  The strip of the West Loop near the Galleria, between IH-69 and IH-10, is an area you should definitely avoid during rush hour if possible.\n\nHouston Traffic Map\nThe outstanding freeways system\nSome of the freeways have an H.O.V. (High-Occupancy Vehicle) lane, which are limited-access lanes in the median strip of the highway.  The HOV lanes are operational Monday - Friday in the morning hours (5AM - 11AM) in the inbound direction and in the outbound direction in the afternoon and evening (2-8PM). The HOV lanes are restricted to cars with 2 or more passengers, however some HOV lanes require 3 or more passengers during peak travel periods (6:45-8AM and 5-6PM, for IH-10 west; 6:45-8AM only for US-290).  The HOV lanes are marked with signs bearing a white diamond on a black background.  Highways with HOV lanes are: IH-45 North, IH-45 South, IH-69 North, IH-69 South, IH-10 West (Katy Freeway), and US-290.  The Katy Freeway HOV lanes have been expanded into the Katy Toll Road, a 24-hour multi-lane HOV with paid Single-Occupancy Vehicle access cost-adjusted based on HOV usage.\n\nHOV lane map & schedule \nKaty Managed Lanes on Harris County Toll Road Authority website\n\n\nBy public transportation\nPublic transportation in Houston is operated by METRO, which runs light rail lines called METRORail, as well as bus lines. The cost to ride is $1.25 each way (Feb 2017).\nIf you pay using your METRO Q Fare Card, METRO Day Pass, or METRO Money, you get free transfers in any direction for up to three hours. METRORail provides 23 miles (37 km) of light-rail service to some of the region\u2019s most popular destinations:\n\nRed Line (North Line) - Travels from NRG Park to the Texas Medical Center, Museum District, Downtown, Northline and numerous stops in between.\nGreen Line (East End Line) - Travels along Harrisburg from the Magnolia Transit Center through the Historic East End to a variety of downtown and entertainment and business destinations.\nPurple Line (Southeast) - Travels from downtown along Capitol and Rusk to popular destinations such as Texas Southern University and the University of Houston.\nThere have been some extensions of the rail network in the 2010s and more are planned for the coming years.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis are easily found in Downtown, Uptown, Midtown, the Medical Center, the suburb of Galveston and both airports.  Taxis in Houston are generally dispatched by various companies the largest being Yellow Cab, \u260f +1-713-236-1111 or from their web page.\n\n\nBy limousine\nMany Houston limousine companies offer full ground transportation options such as town cars, classic cars, stretch limos and luxury vehicles that can be utilized for special occasions like airport transportation, parties, school dances, business functions and weddings. Consider hiring a limousine service to handle your travel needs.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nHouston is so spread out and (most of the time) hot and humid that bicycles are often best used for exercise or to get to somewhere that is close by. On the other hand, if you have a little bit of stamina and perseverance, Downtown, Midtown, Rice, Uptown and the Medical Center/Hermann Park/Museum District area are within a 30-minute ride. Multi-modal transportation is also possible, since most city buses have easy to use racks in the front that can get traveler and bicycle near to a final destination.\nHouston has 290 miles (460 km) of marked bike routes, plus another 80 miles (130 km) of hike and bike trails in city parks, with concrete plans for even more expansion.  For more information on the Houston Bikeway program, including a complete map of all marked bike paths, visit the City of Houston Bikeway Program website.\n\n\nTalk\nHouston is home to more than 100 languages. Signs can be found in Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese, among others, but English is the lingua franca. Knowing some Spanish may help in certain neighborhoods, but most people will speak English.\n\n\nSee\n\nTravelers planning to visit multiple attractions may benefit from the Houston CityPASS, which grants admission to 6 Houston attractions within 9 days of first use for a much reduced rate and includes expedited entry in some cases. The included attractions are: Space Center Houston; Downtown Aquarium; Houston Museum of Natural Science; Houston Zoo; Option Ticket One with choice of either Museum of Fine Arts or the Children's Museum of Houston and Option Ticket Two with choice of either George Ranch Historical Park or the Health Museum.\n\n Astrodome. Dubbed the \"8th Wonder of the World,\" it was one of the world's first fully indoor stadiums and the birthplace of astroturf (that was vacuumed by people in astronaut suits between innings). It was abandoned when the Astros threatened to move unless Minute Maid Park (formerly Enron Field) was built. The stadium is no longer open to visitors, but it is still a spectacle. \n\n\nDo\n\n\nGolf\n Wildcat Golf Club. \n Houston Country club. \n River Oaks Country Club. \n Redstone. \n\n\nParks\nBuffalo Bayou\nEleanor Tinsley Park - The beautiful city skyline backdrops this scenic portion of the park.

A Smoothie King can also be found within the park.\n\n\nEvents & festivals\n Houston CaribFest. Celebrating Caribbean/West Indian Cultures. \n Art Car Parade, Runs along Allen Parkway. April. A parade that must be seen to be believed. For example, in 2010, there were cupcake motorcycles, fire breathing chicken cars, and many other spectacular cars. There are vendors nearby selling water, hats, and food as well. It can get very hot! Free. (updated Mar 2024)\nHouston Livestock Show & Rodeo, Reliant Park. March. HLSR is one of the largest live entertainment and livestock exhibitions in Texas. It runs for 20 days and includes activities for everyone. The rodeo in Houston is considered the city's \"signature event\" akin to \"Mardi Gras\" in New Orleans, the Texas State Fair in Dallas, Comic-Con in San Diego, and the \"Ball Drop\" in New York City.\nMcDonald's Houston Children's Festival, April. Quite possibly the largest children's festival in the United States. It runs for 2 days and includes activities for kids of all ages, including face painting, stage shows, and a whole lot more. The festival is usually held on the first weekend of April.\nHouston Gay Pride Parade, Downtown. June. The Houston Gay Pride Parade and Festival is an annual event that celebrates the city's LGBT community. The parade is a colorful and campy affair. You see people of all ages and ethnicities including families, drag queens, and people dressed in campy, kitch, or costumes. Free\nTexas Renaissance Festival, Todd Mission, October & November. An hour outside of Downtown Houston, the Texas Renaissance Festival (\"Ren Fest\") runs during the weekends from the months of October to November. Guests are welcomed to attend in costume.

May 22. Factory motocross racers from all around the world. to race once a year. Free. \n\n\nCollege sports\nHouston has four universities whose sports teams play in the top-level NCAA Division I:\n\n1 Houston Cougars. The teams representing the city's largest school, the University of Houston, compete in the Big 12 Conference. Most athletic venues are on campus, with the best-known being TDECU Stadium (football) and Fertitta Center (basketball). These venues are marked in the \"South Inner Loop\" page. \n2 Rice Owls. Rice University, the city's most prominent private school, remained in Conference USA during the near-constant conference changes in the early 2010s, but moved to the American Athletic Conference in 2023 (ironically, at the same time UH left The American for the Big 12). As with UH, Rice's main venues are on campus, among them Rice Stadium (football), Tudor Fieldhouse (basketball), and Reckling Park (baseball). These venues are marked in the \"South Inner Loop\" page. \n3 Texas Southern Tigers. Especially of interest to African American visitors, or those interested in African-American culture, are the teams representing Texas Southern University, the city's historically black university. The Tigers compete with other HBCUs in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. Unlike Houston and Rice, whose football teams play in the top-level FBS, Texas Southern football is in the second-level FCS. Most venues are also on campus; the football team has an on-campus stadium, but occasionally uses Shell Energy Stadium and (less often) NRG Stadium. \n Houston Christian Huskies. Houston Christian University (renamed from Houston Baptist University in September 2022), a relatively new addition to Division I, is in the Sharpstown area along the Southwest Freeway. The Huskies joined the FCS-level Southland Conference in 2013, and started a football program at that time. \n\n\nTheater\nHoustonians like theater and the community supports many types of performing arts companies. Most professional theater is centered in the Theater District, but other companies are in different districts around town. The lively culture of Houston also includes numerous community theater organizations and several well regarded university programs.\nThe major downtown performing arts venues include The Wortham Center The Hobby Center Jones Hall and the Alley Theater.\n\n\nLearn\nHouston is home to one of the top universities in the country, Rice University. Its beautifully wooded campus is ideal for an afternoon stroll or jog with loved ones. Baylor College of Medicine is one of the nation's top medical schools, though it does not admit undergraduates.  It is also home to the University of Houston, St. Thomas University, Texas Southern University, and Houston Christian University.\n\n\nBuy\nMany of the shopping malls are concentrated to the west of downtown in Uptown.\nIn general, prices in Houston are lower than in other major US cities.\nA very popular place to go shopping in Houston is the Houston Galleria. The Galleria is the largest mall in Texas and the ninth largest in the United States. At the Galleria you can find people shopping at high end stores such as, Bebe, Coach, Neiman Marcus, Cartier, Gucci, Macy's, Tiffany & Co., Saks Fifth Avenue, The Sharper Image, Ralph Lauren Collection, Louis Vuitton and Houston's only Nordstrom. You can also find people ice skating in the ice rink on the bottom floor. Also, you will find nail salons, 375 stores, restaurants, and two Westin hotels.\n\n\nGroceries and other basics\nThe major supermarket chains in Houston are Kroger, Randall's (which is owned by Albertsons), H-E-B, and Fiesta Mart. In addition the nation's largest discount store chain, Walmart, has several stores in Houston most of which are also open 24 hours and most Kroger stores in Houston are also open 24 hours as well. In addition many specialty and organic supermarkets such as Whole Foods Market, Central Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Trader Joe's can also be found throughout the area.\nDue to its huge expat and immigrant population, Houston also features a large variety of ethnic grocery stores, including Indian, Filipino, Pakistani, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and of course, Mexican.\n\n\nEat\nIndividual listings can be found in Houston's district articles\nHouston has outstanding dining options, and is widely considered the most restaurant-oriented city in the United States, with a thriving community of ethnic restaurants, superb Tex-Mex, classic Texas steakhouses and Gulf Coast seafood, as well as chain restaurants. Houston's fine dining scene has exploded, with Downtown, Montrose, Midtown, and the Heights (including the Washington Corridor) as the epicenter of what's hot-and-happening now.\nAlthough high-quality, authentic Mexican food can be found just about anywhere in the city (for some of the best surprises, stop by any nondescript taqueria and order nearly anything at random), the best ethnic dining is generally found in West Houston - in particular the area west of Highway 59 and south of I-10, with everything from Middle Eastern to Ethiopian to Bosnian. The bustling Mahatma Gandhi District around Hillcroft St. is the place to go for top-notch Indian and Pakistani cuisine. In years past, you'd go east of Downtown or to Midtown for your Chinese or Vietnamese fix (respectively); nowadays the new Chinatown (or sometimes \"Asiatown\") located between Westpark Drive to the North and Beechnut Street to the south, South Gessner Rd to the East and Eldridge Parkway South to the west; is the new one-stop shop for your cravings. Lying just north of I-10, Long Point Drive and between Blalock and North Gessner sport crowded Korean joints, fantastic taco trucks, and hidden Thai gems. \nWith hometown stars such as Monica Pope (T'afia) and Bryan Caswell (Reef, Little Big's, El Real) making their debut on TV shows such as Top Chef and on the Food Network, and more and more chefs and restaurants getting name-checked in media (such as the GQ magazine, Best Of lists, or the declaration by Bon Appetit  of Houston as the best food city in Texas) and earning award nominations (Randy Rucker's Bootsie's Heritage Cafe was up for the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant - the \"Oscars of the restaurant world\"), Houston's dining scene seems slowly but surely to be staking out room on the national stage.\n\n\nEating local\nLike any city with a respectable, trendy food scene, Houston's top restaurants seem to be all about what's seasonal and local these days (oh, and Houston is just now getting into gourmet food trucks), as well as becoming increasingly prominent in stores as well. Fresh produce to seek out include tomatoes, sweet \"1015\" onions (not as sweet as the Hawaiian variety, but pretty impressive), watermelon, strawberries, peaches, corn, carrots, and squash blossoms. Look for local cheese from the Houston Dairymaids - who make just about any variety you can think of - and bread baked daily and shipped to restaurants from the Slow Dough Bakery. Houstonians are just as crazy for crawfish (no \"crayfish\" down here, Yankee) as Louisianans are, as well as catfish and Gulf seafood such as red snapper, blue crab, and shrimp; gaining in popularity are local species that were previously overlooked, such as blackfin tuna, tilefish, grouper, almaco jack, and black drum. Houston has always had a steady supply of oysters from Galveston Bay, but the program of oyster \"appellations\" has been revived, meaning high-quality specimens are labeled with their reef of origin, just like the well-known varieties from the east and west coasts - look for varieties such as Ladies Pass and Pepper Grove.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nLocal beer\n1 The Saint Arnold Brewery.

(updated Dec 2019)\n\n\nSleep\nIndividual listings can be found in Houston's district articles\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nBy phone\nHouston has several telephone area codes and mandatory 10-digit dialing.  For any number, even within your own area code, you need to dial areacode + number.  For local calls, you do not dial a 1+ or a 0+ before the number.  Some calls within Houston are considered long distance, and for those you need to dial 1 + areacode + number.\nHouston's area codes are: 713, 281, 346 and 832. As of Oct 2023, the 621 area code was announced by the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\n\nBy internet\n\n\nWiFi\nAt the George Bush International Airport, the wireless connection is paid and organized by Boingo (wireless network Boingo Hotspot). From the Boingo welcome page, one can also choose (slow) sponsored free internet connection, which is good for an hour. Sometimes, after one hour the next sponsored connection could be opened.\n\n\nBy mail\n\n\nStay safe\n\n\nCrime\nWhile not as infamous as Detroit, Baltimore, or Memphis, the crime rate in Houston is high and the city has a reputation among Texans as a dangerous city. Houston is the largest hub for human trafficking into the United States and is also a major hub for drug and weapons trafficking. Certain areas of Houston are more dangerous than others, including the area within Loop 610 on the east side and some areas in Southwest Houston near Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway).\nAs a general rule, the areas of or portions of Spring Branch, Alief, Fondren Southwest, Sharpstown, Hiram Clarke, and Gulfton should be avoided during the night. Even during the day time, it is best that you exercise special caution in these areas as they have relatively large homeless populations and moderate levels of gang activity. The Third & Fifth Wards, and Southeast/South Central (South Park, Sunnyside, South Acres, Yellowstone) areas should be avoided during the day and night as violent crime is common in these areas. Criminal elements in Houston are known to target random people. The city center is relatively safe during the day time, but special caution should be exercised in the early morning and evening hours, and it is best to avoid the city center during the night, especially if you are alone.\nTravelers to Houston should follow common safety procedures: stay away from deserted areas in the middle of the night, keep your valuables stored out of sight, keep purses and wallets in a secure location, and always put valuables in a car trunk. Call 911 for emergency assistance or report a crime in progress. For non-emergency assistance and for crimes not in progress such as minor assault, car theft, home invasion, property damage, and theft, dial 713-884-3131 and request police assistance. The Houston Police Department also allows citizens to file online reports for minor property damage and theft if they are under $5,000 in damages. Residents of Texas are allowed to carry concealed firearms after completing training and a thorough background check\n\n\nNatural disasters\nLike much of the Gulf Coast, Houston is very vulnerable to hurricanes. If a hurricane is forecast to make landfall anywhere near Houston, listen to officials and heed mandatory evacuation orders if applicable. Even if there isn't a mandatory evacuation order, consider avoiding the city if a hurricane is coming\u2014officials may be hesitant to order an evacuation, even in severe situations, because the city is so huge. The last major hurricane to hit Houston was Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which caused historic flooding and widespread damage. Even tropical depressions and storms can pose a real threat, as Tropical Storm Imelda made landfall in September 2019 and brought flooding that rivaled or even exceeded that of Harvey in some areas.  Hurricane season is June through November, peaking in September.\nHouston is very hot and humid in the summer, with temperatures around 31-38\u00b0C (87-100\u00b0F), similar to tropical cities like Manila or Panama City during the summer. However, in the winter, Houston can be mild with temperatures ranging from -1-18\u00b0C (30-64\u00b0F), and winter climate is usually similar to winters in the rest of the Southern United States or in Southern California.\n\n\nMETRO Rail\nMETRO has never had the foresight to build more light rail on the west side of town where most of the population lives; politicians pandering to oil companies certainly don't help mass transit in Houston. Houston should have world class mass transit but the dumbasses who control it are against it.\nBe careful when coming near the METRO Rail track, especially at intersections.\nFollow the signs since the trains move very quickly and run at almost all hours of the day and night. It runs almost silently. At many streets, left turns are not permitted. Also watch the signs and signals, because some will change as trains approach. Do not drive on the tracks as there are large raised white domes that separate the roadway and the rail line. In some areas signs may indicate driving (or walking) on the tracks is permitted (only in the Texas Medical Center) but make sure it is safe to do so.\nDrive across the tracks only when you are sure it is safe to do so, especially at night as an oncoming train may not be heard by a driver inside a car.\n\n\nCope\nMeditation Classes for Beginners.  Relaxation meditations and meditation classes to increase inner peace.\nIf that isn't your thing. try the simple thing most Houstonians do when they need to release tensions of big city madness: take a walk in the beautiful parks or go walking and shopping downtown. If you know someone who lives in Houston, you can have a lunch on a gorgeous spring day outside. Sometimes the most relaxing and peaceful things don't always involve money.\n\n\nConsulates\nHouston is home to many people of different nationalities and language backgrounds. Therefore, many countries have established full-service consulates (Consulate-General) in Houston to provide consular services for their nationals living in Texas and in the adjacent states in the southeast part of the U.S. as well as visa services for others seeking to visit their respective countries (if required). The Honorary Consu0ates are there for commercial and business purposes and offer limited or no consular services except in emergency situations. Most of the consulates are in or around the Galleria/Uptown area and the West Inner Loop neighborhoods, west of downtown. They can also be in other parts of town too:\n\n  Angola, 1177 Enclave PKWY #200, \u260f +1-713-212-3840.
