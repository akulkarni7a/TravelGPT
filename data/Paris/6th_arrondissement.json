  "extract": "As with Paris itself, the 6th Arrondissement is hard to write about without using superlatives.  There's a bit of everything here, from the busy sidewalks of Paris' main art Gallery scene to the expansive green spaces and under-tree caf\u00e9s of the Jardin du Luxembourg, from the impossible elegance and charm of the rue Bonaparte to the bohemian allure of the Latin Quarter, from the huddle of 'steak/frites' joints around Place St. Michel to some of the finest restaurants in the world - the 6th has it all. Unsurprisingly, visitors find it one of the most romantic and appealing areas of Paris, but so do the Parisians themselves and for many years now the 6\u00e8me (as it is known in French) has been home to artists, writers, designers, intellectuals and the chicest of the chic. Unmissable though it may be, however, the charm of the 6th is such that you may risk not seeing much else of Paris!\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\n 4  runs north-south through the 6th, connecting with the 18th, 9th, 2nd, 1st, and 14th.  If you're arriving from central France or the Loire valley you'll probably connect at Gare Montparnasse.\n\n\nBy RER\n B  of the RER runs through Luxembourg, right next to the Luxembourg garden and close to the Panth\u00e9on.\n\n\nBy bus\nLine 27, 89, 67, 83 run through\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n\n1 Eglise Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s), 3 place St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s (M\u00e9tro: St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s). Daily 08:00-19:30. The oldest church in Paris, founded in the year 542 by King Childebert. The church as it exists today dates mainly from the 11th century, the period in which it became the center of a powerful Benedictine abbey. The Revolution witnessed the suppression of the abbey in 1794, when most of the monastic buildings were put to the torch. Earlier, 318 priests had been hacked to death nearby by a mob on 3 September 1792. The church underwent significant restoration in the 19th century, ensuring the preservation of the building, which by that date represented a fascinating mix of styles: 6th century marble columns placed alongside Gothic vaults and supported by Romanesque arches. Famous burials within the church include Ren\u00e9 Descartes (philosopher), Nicolas Boileau (poet) and King John Casimir of Poland, who had become (in 1669, before his death) abbot of the church's monastery.   \n2 Palais du Luxembourg, 15 rue de Vaugirard (M\u00e9tro Od\u00e9on or Mabillon), \u260f +33 1 44 54 19 49. 10:3-14:30.

At 113 metres long, 58 metres in width and 34 metres tall, it is only slightly smaller than Notre-Dame and thus the second largest church in the city. It is dedicated to Sulpitius the Pious. During the 18th century, an elaborate gnomon, the Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice, was constructed in the church. In front of the church itself is the magnificent Place Saint-Sulpice which contains the 'Fountain of the Four Bishops'. The church has a long-standing tradition of talented organists that dates back to the eighteenth century. In 1862, Aristide Cavaill\u00e9-Coll reconstructed and improved the existing organ built by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Clicquot. Though using many materials from Clicquot's French Classical organ, it is considered to be Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's magnum opus, featuring 102 speaking stops, and is perhaps the most impressive instrument of the romantic French symphonic-organ era. Its organists have also been renowned, starting with Nicolas S\u00e9jan in the 18th century, and continuing with Charles-Marie Widor (organist 1870-1933) and Marcel Dupr\u00e9 (organist 1934-1971), both great organists and composers of organ music. The current organists are 'titulaire' Daniel Roth (since 1985) and 'assistant titulaire' Sophie-V\u00e9ronique Cauchefer-Choplin. In Saint-Sulpice Sunday organ recitals are held on a regular basis (Auditions du Dimanche, following the High Mass, usually from 11:30am till 12:05pm, during the subsequent mass, a visit of the organ loft is possible). free.   \n4 Monument to Balzac (Boulevard Raspail/Boulevard du Montparnasse).
