  "extract": "The 19th arrondissement of Paris is in the north of the city, and is a peaceful, green and family-friendly refuge from the otherwise quite stuffy and/or shabby city. It is a very leisurely area which can provide fun for all ages, especially in the warmer months, and make one easily forget it is the site of the former slaughterhouse district of the city.\nTwo large, wide canals (Canal Saint-Denis and Canal de l'Ourcq) traverse the district and intersect in its middle, where the large Parc de La Villette can be found, housing the science-themed Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie, interesting for all ages, while the Cit\u00e9 des Enfants section is a boon for the kids. On the opposite end of the park, the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique will provide other kinds of sensual stimulation, while further south one can find another park, the romantic Parc des Buttes Chaumont. And you can of course stride - or kayak - along the canals.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nThree metro lines run east-west through the 19th arrondissement - the M5, M7 and M7bis.\n\nthe M5 runs through the middle, providing a convenient connection with Gare du Nord\nthe M7 branches to M7 and M7bis right before the border of the 19th arrondissement, at Louis Blanc.\nM7 goes to the northern part of the arrondissement, stopping in. al. at Porte de la Vilette, where most people begin their visit to Parc de La Vilette\nM7bis goes to the southern part and includes the Buttes-Chaumont station, which is right at the entrance of the namesake park\n\nAdditionally, two metro lines run along the borders of the 19th arrondissement:\n\nthe M2 runs along the western border, with the stations of Stalingrad and Jaur\u00e8s allowing for changeover the M5 and M7 or M7bis (respectively), as well as entering the 19th arrondissement at the Rotonde de La Vilette\nthe M11 runs along the southern border - you can change to M8bis at Place des F\u00eates and to T3b at Porte des Lilas\n\n\nBy tram\nThe T3b tram runs along the northern and eastern borders of the district, stopping in. al. at Porte de la Vilette and allowing changeover to M11 and M12 - as well as providing a relatively scenic ride.\n\n\nBy RER\nThe RER tracks cross the northern part of the 19th arrondissement, there is one station in it, Rosa Parks E (39 Rue Gaston Tessier) with connection to tram T3b.\n\n\nSee\n1 Canal de l'Ourcq, 13, quai de la Loire Bassin de la Villette, \u260f +33 1 4239 1500.

(updated Apr 2023)\n\n\nDo\n\n Buttes-Chaumont, rue Botzaris. Popular city escape for nature lovers and walkers who can spend hours wandering around this lush green paradise. Biggest, most hilly, and least touristy park in Paris, here you still find a real Parisian atmosphere, far from the crowds at the city's centre (it still is crowded in summer during weekends as many Parisians come to sunbathe on the grass). Climb on top of the hill and overlook the north of Paris with the Montmartre hill right in front of you. The park has an almost enchanted feel, with its waterfall (water is pumped from the nearby canal Saint Martin), stream, lake and its steep cliff, topped with a \"temple\" which can only be reached via a suspension bridge. A true oasis indeed \n Cafezo\u00efde, 92 bis, quai de la Loire (M\u00e9tro Crim\u00e9e). W-Sa 10\u02d000-18\u02d000.

Charming and laid-back, this restaurant has a somewhat old fashioned decor (think hard leather chairs, etc). As of May 2024, the food and the service are reported as no longer top-quality. \n Caf\u00e9 de la Musique, 213, av Jean-Jaur\u00e8s, \u260f +33 1 48 03 15 91. Its varied selection of music is what draws the crowds here en masse, at any given night you're likely to hear soulful jazz tunes, or a hip DJ spinning robotic techno. Under chef Alain Podou's watch, the food here is sophisticated, yet light, think lobster-studded risotto and brochettes of shrimp with spinach. Highly recommended. \n Rosa Bonheur. This buvette near the south edge of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont offers a range of tapas and drinks in a charming relaxed atmosphere. Hang out on a sunny day and watch the kids run around and play. \n\n\nDrink\n La Cascade, 2, place Armand-Carrel.
