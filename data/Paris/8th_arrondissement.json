  "extract": "The 8th arrondissement of Paris is home to the Avenue des Champs Elys\u00e9es, which ends up at the Arc de Triomphe.  The executive branch of French government is also based here, as well as the embassies of certain nations.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe four quartiers of the 8th arrondissement are as follows:\n\n\nQuartier des Champs-Elys\u00e9es\nExtending all the way along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es it encompasses the entire southern part of the arrondissement, including its part of the bank of the river Seine. This quartier is home to some of the most luxurious hotels and restaurants, as well as headquarters of luxury goods companies in its western part, and to the famous exhibition venues, the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, as well as Place Concorde in the east.\nApart from Champs-Elys\u00e9es, the main streets of the quartier include Cours Albet 1er/Cours la Reine along the river Seine, Avenue Montaigne (luxury boutiques), Avenue George V (luxury hotels and restaurants) and Avenue Marceau (marking the border with the 16th arrondissement). All four meet at Place de l'Alma, from where the famous Pont de l'Alma bridges the Seine. Three of those (sans Avenue Marceau) are also joined by the perpendicular Rue Francois 1er, which plays host to some more luxury addresses. Avenue Franklin D. Roosevelt, with a large circular Rond-point des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es-Marcel-Dassault in the middle, marks the division between the densely-built part of the quartier to the east and the Jardins de Champs-Elys\u00e9es to the west.\n\n\nQuartier de la Madeleine\nNamed after the L'eglise de la Madeleine temple in its western extremity, this quartier houses some of the most important offices of state of the French Republic, including the presidential Elysee Palace, many embassies and more luxury goods companies and stores along its famous Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore.\n\n\nQuartier du Faubourg-de-Roule\nIt extends from the northern frontage of Champs-Elys\u00e9es and encompasses the Avenue Friedland, the Avenue Hoche and the eastern frontage of Avenue Wagram.\n\n\nQuartier de l'Europe\nThis densely-built quartier around the Gare Saint-Lazare replaced the erstwhile faubourg of Petite-Pologne (\"small Poland\") in the 19th century. The quartier was a centrally-planned development with streets extending from the Place de l'Europe bearing names of European cities such as rue de Vienne or rue de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nFrom airports\nLe Bus Direct offer connections from both the Orly (line 1) and Charles de Gaulle (line 2) airports to Charles de Gaulle-Etoile.\n\n\nBy train\nIn the northeastern part of the 8th arrondissement you will find the 1 Gare Saint-Lazare, which is the second-busiest railway station in Paris, and in fact the whole Europe, by the number of passengers. That said, by the 21st century it is a solely domestic station serving as a terminus for Intercit\u00e9s from Normandy and Transiliens lines J and L, connecting Paris with its suburbs and municipalities of Ile-de-France west of the city.\nThe RER A, which traverses Paris over the northern (right) bank of the Seine and connects to its western and eastern suburbs, including La Defense, crosses the 8th arrondissement but has no stations within the district. You can use it to get to the 8th by getting off at Charles de Gaulle-Etoile at the western end of the 8th or Auber a tad east of the 8th.\nTo get to the 8th arrondissement from other major Paris railway stations you can make use of the following connections:\n\nFrom Gare Montparnasse, take M6, M12 or M13\nFrom Gare du Lyon, take the RER A, M1 or M14. The M14 also serves the nearby Gare du Bercy\nThe Gare du Nord where the majority of international trains arrive, as well as the neighbouring Gare de l'Est, have no direct metro or RER connection to the 8th arrondissement. You may walk from either Gare to the Magenta RER station between them and take the RER E to its terminus at Haussmann - Saint-Lazare, which is connected by an underground passage to Gare Saint-Lazare. Otherwise, you have to either change between metro/RER lines or succumb to the posh atmosphere of the 8th and take a taxi.\nGare d'Austerlitz does not have a good direct connection to the 8th at all. You may take the RER C and get off at any station on the left bank of the Seine facing the 8th and walk across one of the bridges.\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nThe majority of the M\u00e9tro lines, with the exceptions of M4, M5, M7, M10 and M11, have stops within the 8th arrondissement.\n\nM1, which crosses the northern (right) bank of the Seine from east to west, terminating at La Defense, has 5 stops within the 8th along Champs-Elysees\nM2, which follows the borders between the inner and outer districts of the right bank of Seine, does so for the northwestern district of the 8th, with no less than 7 stations along it\nM3, another east-west line on the northern bank, has three stops at the northwestern end of the 8th arrondissement, including the one at Saint-Lazare\nM6, which runs through the southern bank of the Seine, terminates at Charles de Gaulle-Etoile.\nM8 stops at Concorde and Madeleine\nM9, yet another east-west line on the northern bank, has 5 stops in the 8th\nM12, which runs from the north to the south of Paris, has stops along the western border of the 8th arrondissement, including Concorde\nM13, another north-south line, has four stops in the eastern part of the 8th\nM14 has its terminus at Saint-Lazare and also stops at Madeleine before continuing to the east and southeast of Paris\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n\n1 Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es (Franklin D. Roosevelt  3  9 ). For many visitors one of the must-see places in Paris is the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es which was first created in 1667 by Louis XIV's gardener, Andre Le N\u00f4tre, in order to improve the view from the Tuileries garden. This elegant and broad avenue was extended towards the end of the 18th century, now running from the place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe. It is noted today as one of the most prestigious shopping boulevards of Paris.   (updated Jul 2018)\n2 Place de la Concorde (At the east end of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es). The largest square in Paris with fantastic vistas in every direction. It was in this square (then called la Place de la Revolution) that the French King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and many others were guillotined during the Terror. The large Egyptian obelisk in the centre of the Place de la Concorde was brought from the Temple of Luxor.   (updated Jun 2017)\n\n3 l'Arc de Triomphe, Place de l'\u00c9toile, Place Charles de Gaulle (Charles de Gaulle-Etoile  1  2  6  A ), \u260f +33 1 01 11 01 03. This iconic triumphal arch forms the focus of the main east-west road axis of Paris, running between the Louvre and the Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense in the west. The monument was commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 as a tribute to his victories as Emperor of France - it was finally completed in 1836, long after his death. 50 m (150 ft) high and 45 m wide, the Arc de Triomphe is decorated with battle scenes and martial sculptures that includes La Marseillaise by Rude. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was placed beneath the arch in 1920, where an eternal flame burns in tribute to the French dead of both World Wars. The arch is surrounded by a large roundabout, aptly known as l'Etoile - 'the star' - with 12 thoroughfares leading off from it. Visitors can purchase a ticket to climb to the top of the arch, from where magnificent views spread out over western Paris. Admission to a small museum devoted to the history and meaning of the monument is included. The central island and the arch are accessed by an underground passage. Do not attempt to negotiate by foot the busy multi-lane road that rings the Arc de Triomphe, which many Parisian drivers seem to consider their own personal speedway. admission fee applies for over-17s, free for EU-people under 26.   \n\n4 \u00c9glise de la Madeleine (La Madeleine), place de la Madeleine (M\u00e9tro: Madeleine).

Construction started in 1764, although the church was not finally consecrated until 1845. The Madeleine has a lavish interior of marble and gold.   \n5 \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace (Palais de l'\u00c9lys\u00e9e), 55, Rue du Faubourg, Saint-Honor\u00e9.

It is located near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, the name \u00c9lys\u00e9e deriving from Elysian Fields, the place of the blessed dead in Greek mythology. Not open to the public, except occasionally during the annual National Heritage Days (usually a weekend in mid-September). Important foreign visitors are hosted at the nearby H\u00f4tel de Marigny, a palatial residence.   (updated Jan 2018)\n6 Pont Alexandre III.

It is classified as a French Monument historique.   \n\n\nMuseums and galleries\n7 Le Grand Palais (Galeries nationales du Grand Palais). CLOSED UNTIL LATE 2024 OR 2025 FOR RENOVATION WORKS. Built in 1900 for the universal exposition, the Grand Palais was an engineering feat and a milestone of design, marking the transition between historicism and modern architecture. It remain impressive today due to its unique, exquisite style and sheer volume of its main nave. The Grand Palais, managed by the state-owned institution Rnm who also manage the Musee de Luxembourg, is used both for temporary exhibitions of historic and contemporary art collections (both beaux arts and applied) and unique events, such as catwalk shows during the Paris Fashion Week, Bonhams car auctions and prestigious galas.

Private collection of French, Italian, Dutch masterpieces in a typical XIXth century mansion.   \n\n\nParks and greenery\n13 Parc Monceau. One of Paris's best kept secrets, painted by Monet numerous times. It is a very elegant centre of green in the middle of cosmopolitan Paris. Make sure you check out the statues, entrance rotunda and the surrounding mansions. Thanks to Haussmann himself this precious slice of parkland was reserved for the enjoyment and leisure of the people of Paris. It is unusual in France due to its casual, informal \"English\" style planning, and is a contrast to other Parisian parks such as the classically laid out and formal Luxembourg Gardens and the Tuileries. Randomly placed throughout the park are scaled-down architectural replicas including an Egyptian pyramid, Dutch windmill, and a Chinese fort. Free Wi-Fi in the park.   \n\n\nDo\n1 Lido de Paris (Le Lido), 116 bis av des Champs-Elys\u00e9es (Metro 1 George V: Metro 13 Champs-Elys\u00e9es - Cl\u00e9menceau; RER A Station Charles de Gaules Etoile), \u260f +33 1 40 76 56 10.

C42 is the flasghip Citroen store occupying an entire building, designed by Manuelle Gautrand and completed in 2007, being the first new building in the Avenue in some 30 years. The unmistakable facade is inspired by Citroen's chevron logo, and the building has no less than seven storeys exhibiting Citroen's past, present and future, including iconic classics, the concept cars and winning sportscars from its many decades of history, and of course the current lineup. The interior is just as spectacular and unique as the exterior and well worth a visit. \n3 Atelier Renault, Avenue des Champs-Elysees 51-53. Renault has opened its Champs-Elysees showroom at this location in 1910. The highlight of its current form, launched in 2011, is the cafe/restaurant/bar in the \"floating\" mezzanine, where you can enjoy some good drinks and food as well as a nice view over the Champs Elysees and the Renault cars from the past and present exhibited below. Su-Th 10:30-22:30, F Sa 10:30-01:30).  \n Guerlain, No. 68. \n4 Avenue Peugeot, Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es 136. While not as spectacular from the outside as its sister brand Citroen's building, the Avenue Peugeot is also worth a visit if you are a car fan, as it always has a temporary exhibition of some of Peugeot's concept or competition cars the brand is famous for.

Famous in electronic lounge music circles for having commissioned a series of lounge and down tempo records which you can get at most larger record shops in France, as well as abroad. Although you can also get them at the bar it's probably not the best way, since they charge \u20ac45 per CD. The drinks are not so over-priced, and definitely worth it for the hip, sophisticated, and chill atmosphere. \n\n2 The Bowler, 13 Rue d'Artois. English pub regularly frequented by British expats. (updated Sep 2021)\n\n\nSleep\nThanks to its relatively large size and the fact that the most popular attractions are either contained within its borders or in the neighbouring districts, the 8th arrondissement boast a large number of hotels even by Parisian standards. That said, you would be hard-pressed to find really inexpensive accommodation here - most are luxury hotels. For less expensive accommodation, you may want to check out your options in the neighbouring districts.\n\n\nMid-range\n1 Hotel Ceramic Elysees, 34, av de Wagram, \u260f +33 1 42 27 20 30. \n2 Holiday Inn Paris Elysees, 24, rue de Miromesnil, \u260f +33 1 43 12 87 87, contacts@hotelelyseesparis.com.

The \"other\" Intercontinental in Paris contrasts with the lavish historic Grand by having a more subtle, postmodern decor.
