  "extract": "The 15th arrondissement of Paris (also called arrondissment de Vaugirard) is in the city's southwest on the Left Bank of the Seine. Quite up-market and quiet, it is the largest arrondissement by both area and population. Housing over 230,000 inhabitants and providing around 150,000 jobs, it is dense with residential and office developments, including the high rise skyline of Front de Seine along the northern part of the 15th's bank of the river. On the other hand, it sees relatively little tourist traffic \u2014 but that does not mean it is devoid of attractions.\nThe famous skyscraper Tour Montparnasse and the neighbouring railway station Gare Montparnasse are on the eastern border of the 15th arrondissement, although the actual district of Montparnasse is right across the border in the 14th arrondissement.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe 15th arrondissement is further broken up administratively into four quartiers: Grenelle, Necker, Saint-Lambert and Javel.\nGrenelle is the quarter closest to the 7th arrondissement and thus directly neighbouring the Champ de Mars and the Eiffel Tower. Therefore, it houses many hotels advertising the proximity of the Tower. The waterfront part of Grenelle is home to the 1970s high-rise residential development of Beaugrenelle, and the eponymous shopping mall. The more inland parts of the quarter are filled with 19th-century Haussmannian buildings, interspersed with some more modern ones.\nThe quarter of Necker, situated between Grenelle and the quarter of Montparnasse of the 14th arrondissement, is home to some of the locations named after Montparnasse, most notably the Tour Montparnasse and Gare Montparnasse. It also houses more large public service and commercial buildings, such as the expansive H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades. Otherwise, it is full of late 20th-century residential buildings, with many fewer Haussmannian structures than Grenelle.\nThe southeast quarter of Saint-Lambert is most known for the Parc des expositions de la porte de Versailles, which is one of the largest and most important exhibition centres in France and Europe.\nThe southwestern quartier Javel had long been an industrial area of Paris, but has been reclaimed as office, residential, and recreational over the decades. It contains the Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn, created over the former Citro\u00ebn factory grounds, and the Heliport of Paris in its southern extremity.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nThe Gare Montparnasse is at the northeastern extremity of the arrondissement and offers many good connections within the district and all of Paris. Also a direct train to Chartres.  The Transilien N ends its run here.\nRER C runs along the left bank of the Seine across the 15th arrondissement and beyond with stops including Champ de Mars\u2013Tour Eiffel, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Saint-Michel-Notre Dame and Gare d'Austerlitz. In the other direction it is a direct line to Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau.\nAlso to Orly airport through Pont de Rungis stop.\n\n\nBy metro\nThe following lines go through the 15th arrondissement:\n\n 6  crosses the northern part of the 15th from east to west over an elevated estacade. It forms a southern ring through Paris, running between \u00c9toile and Nation and also stopping at Gare Montparnasse.\n 8  runs from the south of the 15th arrondissement northwards, continuing through the 7th onto the right bank of the Seine, including stops at Op\u00e9ra, R\u00e9publique and Bastille.\n 10  takes a southwest/northeast tangent through the 15th, connecting it to the 5th, 6th and Gare d'Austerlitz from one end, and the 16th as well as Boulogne-Billancourt from the other.\n 12  runs north-south through the eastern 15th, entering it at the north at Gare Montparnasse. It also stops further north at Saint-Lazare.\nMajor changeover stations:\n\nMontparnasse-Bienven\u00fce  4  6  12  13  (at the foot of Gare Montparnasse).\nLa Motte-Picquet\u2013Grenelle  6  8  10 \nPorte de Versailles  12  - also trams T2 and T3a pass here.\n\n\nBy tram\nT2 from La D\u00e9fense ends its run at Porte de Versailles, where it connects to T3a and M12\nT3a runs across the south of the 15th arrondissement, starting from the Seine and continuing into the 14th, 13th and 12th\n\n\nBy bus\nLines: 39, 62, 42 (from Gare du Nord), 88, 80, 70, 39\n\n\nBy Batobus\nStation Beaugrenelle, Port de Javel Haut [1]\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n1NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Tour Montparnasse (Next to the Gare Montparnasse station). 09:30-22:30. If the queues at the Eiffel Tower are just too much for you and your time is limited, consider a trip up the Montparnasse Tower. This is an office building with an observation and shopping area on the 56th floor, where the elevators stop, and an open viewing area on the roof. Arguably the view is better than from the Eiffel Tower: you are not so high up so things are more visible, and you can see the Eiffel Tower! \u20ac11.50, with discounts, children under 7 are free of charge.   \n2 \u00cele aux Cygnes (Pont de Grenelle \u2013 Pont de Bir-Hakeim).
