  "extract": "The 20th arrondissement of Paris lies to the east of the centre and represents an old working-class area now in rapid transformation. The main drawing card here for tourists is the P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery, though, for travellers who are interested in music and culture, this relatively gritty area is probably going to be one of your main night-crawling areas.\nThere are nightclubs and caf\u00e9s specializing in everything from punk-rock to world music both in the Bagnolet neighbourhood south of the cemetery and in the M\u00e9nilmontant neighbourhood north of the cemetery. Hopping from one show to the other, you'll find lots of little caf\u00e9s to have a beer priced at less than nightclub rates, or a pick-me-up coffee.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nTwo main Metro stations on line 3: Gambetta  3  and P\u00e8re Lachaise  3 .\nA more lively entrance, though far from the famous Pere Lachaise Cemetery is through the Alexandre Dumas  2 .\n\n\nBy bus\nBus 76 connects Rue de Bagnolet to the heart of Paris including Bastille and the Louvre.\n\n\nSee\n1 Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re Lachaise (P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery), main entrance: boul de M\u00e9nilmontant (P\u00e8re Lachaise  2  3 ), cimetiere.perelachaise@paris.fr.
