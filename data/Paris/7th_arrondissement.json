  "extract": "The 7th arrondissement is perhaps the most expensive area to live in Paris. The Eiffel Tower, one of the most famous tourist sites in the world, is here, as well as many government buildings (ministries, the National Assembly and so on). Many dignitaries and VIPs populate this arrondissement.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro/RER\n 6  serves Bir-Hakeim (Eiffel Tower).\n 8  serves stations Invalides (Les Invalides), Varenne (Les Invalides, Musee de Rodin), Ecole-Militaire (Eiffel Tower), Latour Maubourg (Hotel des Invalides).\n 10  serves S\u00e8vres-Babylone (Le Bon Marche).\n 12  serves stations Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, Solf\u00e9rino, Rue du Bac, S\u00e8vres-Babylone.\n 13  serves Invalides (Les Invalides).\nRER  C  serves stations Invalides (Les Invalides), Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel (Eiffel Tower), Musee D'Orsay (Musee D'Orsay).\n\n\nBy boat\nBatobus, the hop-on hop-off service serving tourist sites on the Seine has stops at Tour Eiffel and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n\n1 La Tour Eiffel (The Eiffel Tower) (Bir-Hakeim  6  or \u00c9cole Militaire  8 , Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel  C ), \u260f +33 8 92 70 12 39. 09:30-23:45; Jun 21-Sep 02: 09:00-00:45; Jul 14,Jul 15 off. A symbol of Paris and one of the most famous landmarks in the world. Built by Gustave Eiffel in 1887-1889, the tower was almost torn down in 1909 and only saved due to its use as a telegraphy antenna. The queues can be very long. The tower allows online reservations at its website. You can select a date and time frame. If you miss the time on your ticket, you have lost your money. The north, west, and east pillars have elevators that go to the first and second floors; the south pillar has stairs that can be climbed to the second floor. To reach the top floor, an additional elevator ride is required, and the wait for this can be very long as well. Disabled visitors are not allowed beyond the second floor due to safety concerns. Taking the M\u00e9tro as far as Ecole Militiare and then strolling up the Champ de Mars is a lovely way to arrive at the tower. Another phenomenal approach is to exit the Metro at Trocadero and see the Eiffel Tower from the other side of the Ecole Militaire. \u20ac25 (\u20ac12 for age 12-24) to the top by lift.
