  "extract": "The 10th arrondissement of Paris centres on the Canal Saint Martin and the restaurants and caf\u00e9s which line its banks. Part sleepy faubourg \u2014 as suburbs were called in 18th century Paris \u2014 and part industrial centre, the 10th arrondissement has lately enjoyed the benefits of both the booming nightlife scene in the neighbouring 11th, as well as the Parisian cycling and roller-blading boom. The streets lining the canal become car-free for the later half of the day each Saturday, and all day on Sundays for your cycling and strolling pleasure.\nThere is another, more bustling side to the cosmopolitan 10th, however, as it is the location of two primary entry / exit points for the city, in the form of the two great train stations Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est.\nOne final focus to the 10th is the historic Place de la R\u00e9publique in the far south of the arrondissement, its many bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nAs it is everywhere in Paris all metro stations are not equal. Stations such as Place de la Republique connect to many lines but can be time consuming for a first time visitor.  A smaller station such as Goncourt is easier to get in and out of.  You may walk a bit more on the street but that's easy and a lot more fun.\n\n\nDo\n1 Palais des Glaces, 37, rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, \u260f +33 1 4202 0525. M-Sa, 11:00-18:30.

Linger over a coffee and tuck into a pastry while feeling that you are experiencing the true Paris.   \n\n\nSee\n1 Porte Saint Denis. A triumphal arch built in 1672 for Louis XIV, in the former city wall.   \n\n\nBuy\nThe Boulevard de Strasbourg, between Place de la R\u00e9publique and Gare de l'Est, is known for supporting the coiffure or hairdressing trade, with dozens of shops selling hairdressing equipment and supplies. Interestingly the African hairdressers of Paris have set up shop right alongside their suppliers. So if you're interested you can have your hair done up in dreadlocks, pearly braids or another African style and can have your nails done too!\nMeanwhile rue de Marseille has a number of trendy clothing shops. Another good spot to explore the slightly dilapidated Passage Brady. It's full of Indian and Pakistani restaurants, for which it's sometimes called \"le Petit Bombay\". Stop in at the Bazaar Velan for incense, spices, and kitsch souvenirs.\nFor South Asian expats missing products from home, the stretch of Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis between Gare du Nord and La Chapelle metro station is home to several Asian grocers, clothes/jewellery shops, Bollywood DVD shops and even a mithai (Indian confectionary) shop.
