  "extract": "The 11th Arrondissement is home to two quite different but equally blossoming centres of Parisian nightlife. The streets just northwest of Place de la Bastille are full of little bars which attract a mix of young suburban Parisians, expats, and foreigners.  Many have a Latin American theme. The restaurants, bars, and wine-bars around Rue Oberkampf in the north of the 11th and rue de Charonne near Avenue Ledru Rollin attract a more urban crowd and are perhaps closer to something traditionally Parisian, while capturing some of the grungy feel of drinking spots in up-and-coming inner city neighbourhoods everywhere.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the 11th Arrondissement of Paris was an industrial area of factories and homes of factory workers. There was never an intent to build monuments other than local churches. Thus, there are few special places to see or unusual things to do.\nIt was not until the mid-2000s that young Parisians began to move into the 11th because apartments were less expensive there than in other Parisian areas. With this influx, restaurants and bars proliferated in two areas, along and to the north of rue de la Roquette and around rue Oberkampf. With its history, the 11th is a place to eat and drink. Within the 11th are several boutique hotels, restaurants and bars set in former factories.\nAs of 2015, the 11th arrondissement had about 150,000 residents, that is, 41,000 residents/km2, making it the most densely populated of all arrondissements of Paris (the next densest were the 18th and 20th, with about 33,000/km\u00b2) and of all the urban districts in Europe. Because of the population density, public transportation is widely available.\nLike each Paris arrondissement, the 11th is divided into administrative quartiers.\n\nQuartier de la Folie-M\u00e9ricourt with the north border of la rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, to the east by le boulevard de Belleville, to the west by blvd du Temple and the south by rue Oberkampf. This quartier is quite lively with many restaurants and bars frequented by young and upscale customers. It is known as a 'BoBo' quartier (bourgeois, bohemian), or a hipster neighborhood. That is, those who support bohemian values but lead bourgeois lives.\nQuartier Saint-Ambroise bordered to the north by rue Oberkampf, to the east by blvd M\u00e9nilmontant, west by blvd des Filles-du-Calvaire and part of blvd Beaumarchais plus to the south by rue du Chemin-Vert. This quartier is rather calm and residential.\nQuartier de la Roquette has a border to the north of rue du Chemin-Vert, to the east by blvd M\u00e9nilmontant and a part of blvd Charonne, to the west by a part of blvd Beaumarchais and Place de la Bastille and part of rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine. Many bars and restaurants can be found along rue de la Roquette that attract a young crowd.\nQuartier Sainte-Marguerite is bordered to the north and west by rue de Charonne, to the east by blvd Charonne, and the south by rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine. It is mainly a quiet residential area but there are some bars and restaurants along rue de Charonne and rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine worth researching.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nStation 1 R\u00e9publique  3  5  8  9  11  is at the 11th arrondissement's northwestern corner. R\u00e9publique is superbly well-connected and therefore very convenient to access the 11th arrondissement.\nOther m\u00e9tro stations that serve as major hubs allowing easy entry to the 11th arrondisement are 2 Nation  1  2  6  9  and 3 Bastille  1  5  8 \n\n\nGet around\nThe 11th is densely populated and offers many connections by Metro and bus. Travel on foot is a viable solution\n\n\nSee\n1 Cirque d'Hiver. Mainly used as a concert hall and venue for fashion shows today, the Cirque d'Hiver was built in 1852, as the name would suggest, as a winter venue for circuses.   \n2 Mus\u00e9e Edith Piaf, 5, rue Crespin du Gast (M\u00e9tro M\u00e9nilmontant), \u260f +33 1 43 55 52 72.

On January 7th, 2015, it was the site of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack, which resulted in the deaths of 12 people.

Attend a concert or have a drink at this popular caf\u00e9-concert music hall inaugurated in 1865 featuring brightly painted Chinese architecture.

The is caf\u00e9 on the ground floor is outstanding, perhaps even better than in the old days. A memorial honoring those 90 persons killed in a terrorist attack on 13 Nov 2015 is across the street in a small park.
