  "extract": "The 2nd arrondissement of Paris is one of the financial centres of Europe, being home to the Bourse (stock exchange) and thus the CAC 40 index you hear about in world financial news. Other major activities in the neighbourhood are journalism and fashion.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe 2nd is home to the galleries\u2014covered passages lined with shops\u2014which are quite possibly the prototypes of today's shopping malls. One finds shops, caf\u00e9s and hotels inside.\nWhile the aforementioned are all daylight activities, the east end of the arrondissement has an entirely different reputation, having been home to Paris's red-light district since sometime in the early renaissance.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nBeing right in the middle of the city, the 2nd arrondissement is well served by the M\u00e9tro system. 5 lines provide direct access to the district via 10 different stations.\n\n 8  and  9  both run east-west right across the northern edge of the arrondissement with 4 stations, distanced every 200 to 400 meters. Take your pick, all of the stations are small, and unless you're making a connection just as good as another.\n 3  runs east-west right through the centre of the arrondissement, with 5 stations down rue du Quatre Septembre and rue R\u00e9aumur.\n 4  runs north-south along the eastern edge.\n 7  running north-south, has one stop (Op\u00e9ra  3  7  8 ) near the west edge of the arrondissement.\n\n\nGet around\n\nAs the 2nd is the smallest arrondissement, it is easy to travel many places within it on foot. It's possible to comfortably walk the entire perimeter of the district in around an hour.  Much of the SE corner is closed to traffic.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nMuseums\n1 la Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, 58 rue Richelieu (M\u00e9tro: Bourse or Palais-Royal), \u260f +33 1 53 79 59 59. Reading rooms, M-F, 09:00-18:00; Sa, 09:00-17:00; exhibitions, Tu-Sa, 10:00-19:00. Try to visit the cabinet des M\u00e9dailles. Library, free; exhibitions, \u20ac5-10.   \n\n\nArchitecture\nThe 2nd arrondissement covers some of the nicest old parts of Paris.\n\n2 Notre Dame des Victoires. 17th century church.   \n3 Place des Victoires. Beautiful round \"square\" with an equestrian statue of King Louis XIV and matching 17th century buildings.   \n\n\nHistory\nThere have been dozens of attempts by various regimes at all levels including the city, the state, and the church to chase the working girls away from the east end of the 2nd arrondissement, but for some reason they always come back. Interestingly, the word \"bordello\" originates here, from the boards that the women used to subdivide the rooms they rented in houses along the rue Saint Denis and others.\nThe press has had nearly as long a run in the neighbourhood just to the west, and several of France's major newspapers still maintain offices here.\n\n4 La Tour Jean-sans-Peur, 20, rue \u00c9tienne-Marcel (M\u00e9tro: \u00c9tienne-Marcel). Apr-Oct, W-Su, 13:30-18:00. One of the last remnants of medieval Paris outside of the 4th, this tower was once part of a castle called l'h\u00f4tel de Bourgogne. \u20ac5; students \u20ac3; guided tour, \u20ac8.   \n\n\nDo\n1 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique (National Op\u00e9ra Comic Theatre), 5, rue Favart, \u260f +33 1 42 44 45 40. The th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique (National Op\u00e9ra Comic Theatre) is an opera company and opera house.   \n\n\nBuy\n1 Rue Montorgueil pedestrian area. Rue Montorgueil is like a scene from a movie. Closed to traffic, the street is a food-lovers delight, with cafes, bars, and all types of fresh produce for sale in the open air.   \n2 Terroirs d'Avenir, 6-7-8, rue du Nil, \u260f +33 1 45 08 48 80. Slow food distribution on three different stores: a grocer, a fish monger and a butcher. They all source fresh, quality, mostly organic produce. \n3 La librairie gourmande, 92-96 rue Montmartre, \u260f +33 1 43 54 37 27, contact@librairiegourmande.fr. L-Sa 11:00-19:00. The book shop is specialized on books for chefs, interested cooks or foodies. \n\n\nThe galleries\nPrototypical indoor shopping malls, the galleries got their start in 1786 when the Duke of Orleans realized that there was money to be made by renting out his cloistered garden to small shops. With their glass roofs and tiled floors they were a welcome respite to the newly emerging middle-class shopper of the early 19th century, in the days before electric light and sidewalks.\nA walking tour of the galleries can easily be accomplished in an hour or so, and is worthwhile even though they are long past their glory days.\n\n4 La Gallerie Vivienne. Start with the best preserved of the galleries and whose d\u00e9cor has been maintained in authentic colours from the era. It's really the mosaic floor which is the star of the show. The shops are distinctly upscale, and all about conspicuous consumption: a wine seller, a tea shop, and a dealer in antique books are among the highlights.   (updated Jun 2017)\n5 Passage Choiseul. A considerably more down-to-earth gallery, the passage mainly serves traders on their way to the bourse, with the same class of shops that one might find in a pedestrian tunnel in New York or Chicago: a shoeshine stand, a newsstand, and little almost-but-not-quite fast-food restaurants.   (updated Jun 2017)\nYou can find more galleries throughout the arrondissement, namely\n\n6 Passage des Panoramas.   (updated Jun 2017)\n7 Passages des Princes.   (updated Jun 2017)\n8 Passage du Grand-Cerf.   (updated Jun 2017)\n\n\nEat\n\n\nBudget\n1 Blend Hamburger, 44, rue d'Argout (M\u00e9tro Sentier). French meat with home made ketchup. \u20ac15 lunch menu, \u20ac10 burger. \n2 Le Bougainville, 5, rue de la Banque (M\u00e9tro Bourse), \u260f +33 1 42 60 05 19. M-Sa 19:00-21:00, but food is only served at lunch from 11:30 to 15:30. This comfy little bar offers home cooking from the Auvergne region, and after-work drinks for the financial set. Sandwiches, \u20ac3; plates \u20ac12-15. \n3 Grill\u00e9, 15, rue Saint-Augustin (M\u00e9tro Quatre-Septembre). M-F 09:00-19:00. A fast food restaurant that makes a \"healthy\" version of kebab (good herbs, better salad). Three cooks, Marie Carcassonne, Hugo Desnoyer, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Peneau worked on this creation. \u20ac8 kebab, \u20ac10 formule. \n4 Rani Mahal, 9, rue Saint-Augustin, \u260f +33 1 42 97 53 24. This Indian restaurant is raved about by vegetarians. It serves meat as well. \n\n\nMid-range\n5 Caf\u00e9 Etienne Marcel, 34, rue Etienne Marcel (M\u00e9tro Etienne Marcel), \u260f +33 1 45 08 01 03. A Costes brothers creation but with lower prices than many of their other restaurants. The Etienne Marcel combines a creative menu with hip interior design and hip musical ambiance. Vegetarians: The crispy risotto balls (risotto croustillant) are amazing, and pretty much impossible to make at home. \u20ac15-20. \n Le Tambour, 41, rue Montmartre, \u260f +33 1 42 33 06 90. Dinner until 03:30 !. The really distinguishing feature of the Tambour is its very late hours. \n\n\nSplurge\n6 Drouant, 16-18, place Gaillon, \u260f +33 1 42 65 15 16. Anthony Cl\u00e9mot runs this French kitchen. \n\n\nDrink\n1 Caf\u00e9 Noir, 65, rue Montmartre (M\u00e9tro Sentier or Bourse), \u260f +33 1 45 08 42 35. A particularly fine example of a Paris caf\u00e9. \n La Cantine, 151, rue Montmartre (Passage des Panoramas, M\u00e9tro Grandes Boulevards). M-F, 09:00-18:00. A technology focused caf\u00e9 and co-working space. \n2 The Frog & Rosbif, 116, rue St Denis (M\u00e9tro Etienne Marcel), \u260f +33 1 42 36 34 73. As you probably know the English use the word \"frog\" as an ethnic slur for the French. You may not know that the word \"rosbif\" is a French ethnic slur for the English. Well, it seems that there are mostly no hard feelings over a pint, or so the presence of this chain of 6 English pubs in the French capital would tend to suggest. \n3  Harry's New York Bar, 5, rue Daunou (Metro Op\u00e9ra), \u260f +33 1 42 61 71 14. M-Su, 10:30-04:00.
