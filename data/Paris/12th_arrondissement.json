  "extract": "The 12th arrondissement of Paris is one of the largest of the city's districts even without the 2,460 acre Bois de Vincennes, which more than doubles its size.  Gare de Lyon in the 12th will likely be your arrival point if you are coming from Switzerland, Italy, or the south of France.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nThe newest M\u00e9tro, line 14, serves Gare de Lyon and Gare de Bercy.\nLine 1 crosses the arrondissement east-west serving Bastille, Gare de Lyon, Reuilly-Diderot, Nation, and Porte de Vincennes.\nLine 8 crosses the arrondissement east-west serving Bastille, Ledru-Rollin, Faidherbe-Chaligny, Reuilly-Diderot, Montgallet, Daumesnil, Michel Bizot, Porte Dor\u00e9e, and Porte de Charenton.\nLine 6 arrives from the left bank, serving Bercy, Dugommier, Daumesnil, Bel-Air, and Picpus.\nThe RER-A passes east-west through the 12th serving Gare de Lyon and Nation.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n1 Jardin Yitzhak Rabin. Nestled in the centre of the Parc Bercy (below) is a lovely, and truly peaceful, garden with several waterworks and other high-quality landscape-art pieces. If you are one of the many people visiting the 12th on business it would be well worth an hour of your time between meetings and dinner to explore the mound, the fountain, and the bridges, and to watch children play in complete peace, much like the peace to which the garden's namesake dedicated his life.   \n2 Bercy Village (Cour Saint-\u00c9milion  14 ). For a taste of the French countryside, a visit to Bercy Village brings to life the spirit of market shopping inside Paris.   (updated Oct 2022)\n3 AccorHotels Arena. An indoor sports arena that seats around 17,000 for sports and slightly over 20,000 for major concerts; formerly known as Palais des Omnisports de Paris-Bercy and Bercy Arena. Home to numerous concerts and major sporting events, most notably the Paris Masters tournament on the ATP World Tour in men's tennis.   \n4 Op\u00e9ra Bastille, Place de la Bastille (M\u00e9tro Bastille). One of the truly great venues for the performing arts anywhere in the world, Paris' new opera house actually managed to inspire some neighborhood protest during its planning and construction. Pretty much everybody is a believer nowadays though. Check out the website for upcoming shows, it might even make sense to plan a trip to Paris around one.   \n5 Promenade Plant\u00e9e (Coul\u00e9e verte Ren\u00e9-Dumont). If you were a city planner in one of the great cities of our Earth and you discovered that a railroad right-of-way had been abandoned and would never be used again what might you do? Perhaps if you knew your stuff you'd convert it into a 4 mile long park, about half of which is elevated above street level on the old rail viaduct. This long narrow park pretty much allows the visitor to walk in carfree bliss from Place de Bastille to the Bois de Vincennes.   \n\n6 Parc de Bercy. Between the River Seine and the rail yards attached to Gare de Lyon and Gare de Bercy is a green space which would seem pretty huge if the 12th weren't also the home of the Bois de Vincennes. The park is a good place to hang out waiting for the line to form for sporting events and concerts at AccorHotels Arena.   \n7 Bois de Vincennes (M\u00e9tro Porte Dor\u00e9e or Porte de Charenton). There are many beautiful footpaths, a Buddhist Temple, and a lake with rowboats available for rental (about \u20ac10 as of 2009). The lake has many different kinds of birds, and islands accessible by footbridge.   \n8 Picpus Cemetery (Cimeti\u00e8re de Picpus), 35 Rue de Picpus (Metro Nation), \u260f +33 1 43 44 18 54. Tu-Sa 14:30. A must for anyone interested in the history of the American Revolution. This small cemetery includes three mass graves from the French Revolution, plus a section that includes many of France's most noble families that lost members during the French Revolution and consequently have a continuing right to be buried there. In the farthest right hand corner is the tomb of General Lafayette, the friend and fellow soldier of George Washington. Beside him is his beloved wife plus other members of her family, the de Noailles, who were almost completely wiped out during the French Revolution because of their closeness to the Court. Since 1834 the American flag has apparently flown continuously over his grave, even during the German occupation of Paris during World War II. Well worthy of a visit.   \n9 Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes. A former fortress and royal residence at the edge of the city, alongside the Bois de Vincennes. Most of the building is open to public.

Taken as a whole it's known as the Viaduc des Arts', and is well worth a stroll for those interested in art and design.\nAnother shopping highlight of the 12th is the amazing number of electronics and computer shops, mostly clustered around rue Charenton near the Jardin de Reuilly, as one would expect the intense competition keeps prices low (for Europe).\n\n New PC Charenton, 171 rue de Charenton, \u260f +33 1 43 07 02 30.
