  "extract": "The 9th arrondissement of Paris is a diverse, \"in between\" section of the French capital. The Grands Boulevards area of shopping thoroughfares and flagship department stores (as well as the original Opera - hence the common name for the district) is to be found in the southern part of the arrondissement (shared with the 2nd and the 8th). By way of contrast, the fading red-light  and cheap shopping district of Pigalle is in the north of the 9th, closely adjoining Montmartre on the hill above in the 18th. In between the two, relatively-speaking, lies a traveller's no-man's-land / terra incognita - though the streets around St Lazare used to be the Impressionists stronghold in Paris.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nMain stations are: Op\u00e9ra  3  7  8 , Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin La Fayette  7  9 , Grands Boulevards  8  9 , Le Peletier  7 , Notre-Dame-de-Lorette  12 , Richelieu-Drouot  8  9 .\n\n\nSee\n\nAs with the other 19 arrondissements of Paris there are a lot of little commemorative plaques scattered around on the houses of the 9th. One example is the site of the first public demonstration of the Lumiere brother's moving picture projection system which is marked by a pair of commemorative plaques at 14, boul des Capucines between rue Scribe and rue Edward VIII.\n\n1 Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin, 10, boul Montmartre, \u260f +33 1 47 70 85 05. The Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin is a waxwork museum with some 500 characters arranged in scenes from the history of France and modern life.   \n2 Mus\u00e9e Gustave Moreau, 14, rue de la Rochefoucauld (M\u00e9tro: Trinit\u00e9), \u260f +33 1 48 74 38 50, fax: +33 1 48 74 18 71. W-M, 10\u02d000-12.45 and 14\u02d000-17\u02d015. The house of the symbolist painter has now become a museum to his life and work. \u20ac4 (some reductions on offer).   \n3 Op\u00e9ra Garnier, place de l'Op\u00e9ra (Op\u00e9ra  3  7  8 ). Daily, 10\u02d000-16:30. The magnificent setting of The Phantom of the Opera, the inside is as opulent as the outside. However, since the opening of the Opera Bastille (12th) in 1989, the Palais Garnier has been reserved mostly for dance performances, particularly ballet. \u20ac7. The cheapest seats for actual performances can go as low as \u20ac6 if you book early.   \n4 Colorful basketball court (Pigalle Duperr\u00e9). An unusually colorful court in the middle of buildings. (updated Apr 2018)\n\n\nDo\nAdmire the skyline from the roofs of Printemps or the Galeries Lafayette. There's also a hot air balloon at Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn (southwest Paris), but not on windy days.\n\n1 les Grands Boulevards (Boulevards of Paris). Go shopping at the grands magasins (department stores).   \n2 Olympia (Olympia Hall), 28, boul des Capucines. A music hall, which houses concerts for an older crowd. Be sure to tip the usher \u20ac2 or so.   \n3 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00c9douard VII, 10 place \u00c9douard VII (M\u00e9tro Op\u00e9ra. Between the Madeleine and the Op\u00e9ra), \u260f +33 1 47 42 35 71, contact@theatreedouard7.com. French theatre, for those with command of the language. \u20ac20-55.   \n\n\nBuy\nParticularly interesting in this area are the covered passageways built in the 19th century, charming early versions of the shopping mall. There are several in the vicinity of boulevard Haussmann and rue Vivienne, including passage Jouffroy and passage Verdeau, and across the boulevard Haussmann in the 2nd arrondissement, the passage des Panoramas.\nThe department stores along the boulevard Haussmann are overpriced compared to smaller specialty shops. For a more interesting selection and better quality-price ratio, venture out to the innumerable shopping streets in Paris. Make sure to say bonjour on entering and merci, au revoir on leaving. For more information on common courtesy in Paris, see the main Paris article.\n\n1 Galeries Lafayette, 40, boul Haussmann. Founded in 1894, and is the flagship store of the department store chain. The gourmet section is a Paris institution that takes up an entire floor, featuring (among many other things) several competing vendors of deluxe baguettes, a few hundred types of cheese, and an entire aisle devoted to mustard. Depending on your home country you may be eligible for a 10% discount for all goods (you just need to show a flyer that is attached to tourist office Paris maps).   \n Printemps, 64, boul Haussmann. \n\n\nEat\nIf you're in the southern part of the neighbourhood, you might also consider arrondissements 2 or 8 - neither are more than a short walking distance. You could also visit the food section of any of the grands magasins, or one of the smaller traiteurs (shops selling prepared food), and pick up the ingredients for a piquenique in the square Louis XVI on boulevard Haussmann and rue Pasquier; square de la Trinit\u00e9, at the top of rue de la chauss\u00e9e d'Antan--free concerts in the church at 12:30 most Thursdays; or the square du Montholon on rue de la Fayette between rue Cadet and rue du faubourg Poissoni\u00e8re.
