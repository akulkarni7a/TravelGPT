  "extract": "Although largely residential, the 14th arrondissement is best known for its northeastern quartier Montparnasse, for the Paris Catacombs and the Parc Montsouris. The Cit\u00e9 Universitaire is also found in this district traditionally known for lively caf\u00e9s and restaurants around the Boulevard du Montparnasse and the rue Daguerre.\nThe Tour Montparnasse and Gare Montparnasse are in the 15th arrondissement, but they are described here for consistency.\n\n\nGet in\nThe station 1 Denfert-Rochereau  4  6  B  makes for a good entry point.\n2 Gare Montparnasse, is in the north-east corner of the 15th arrondissement, just north of the 14th, and is a terminus for TGV and regular trains from the west and south-west of France: Tours, Brest, Rennes, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse,  Hendaye. M\u00e9tro: Montparnasse-Bienven\u00fce. Gare Vaugirard is an extension of Gare Montparnasse.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Les Catacombes de Paris (Catacombs of Paris), 1 place Denfert-Rochereau (Denfert-Rochereau  4  6  B ). Tu-Su 9:45-20:30; last admission 19:30; closed Mo and public holidays. One of the most eye-popping sights of Paris, the catacombs represent a network of labyrinthine tunnels, first excavated in the Roman period, that now house the remains of over 6 million burials removed here from the various overcrowded cemeteries and charnel houses all over Paris in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Well worth a visit: the atmosphere is suitably morbid and gloomy (without being too scary), the dark tunnels containing neatly stacked piles of skulls and long bones. There is a limit to the number of visitors allowed within the Catacombs at one time (200 persons). So, if you arrive just after opening, you must wait until someone exits, approximately 45\u201360 minutes, before anyone is admitted. Steep stairwell on the exit of the catacombs. Can be challenging for the elderly or the unfit.

The observatory is not open to the public.   \n7 Parc Montsouris, boul Jourdan (RER Cit\u00e9-Universitaire). Considered one of the most colourful Parisian parks, a local favourite, the Parc Montsouris was opened in 1878, having been designed by Alphand for Baron Haussmann. A large man-made lake and waterfalls are surrounded by long stretches of gently sloping lawns. Bronze statues are to be found studding the grounds, amongst the 1,400 trees, including such exotic varieties as the giant sequoia and the ginkgo. The park is featured in the film Cl\u00e9o de 5 \u00e0 7. It is popular among families (there are two playground areas for children) and students.   \n8 Port-Royal Abbey, 123, boul de Port-Royal.

Check-in: 12:00, check-out: 12:00. Very cheap private rooms, close enough to the metro to make it worth it. Rooms are very clean, and have TV, free Wi-Fi, and washbasin only. Shared showers and toilets. The showers are fine, but, there are no toilet-seats and no urinals (thus, the shared toilets get very nasty, very fast and people have to go back to their rooms to wash their hands in their washbasin), so the quality of the bathrooms may keep this hotel chain out of reach for serious germ-a-phobes. It is, nevertheless, cheaper for two people to stay here than just about any youth hostel in Paris. Nice and safe neighbourhood, too, with several supermarkets and kebab vendors for eats. \u20ac48. \n\n\nMid-range\n Voco Paris Montparnasse (IHG Hotels), 79-81, av du Maine, \u260f +33 1 43 20 13 93.

It has all the pros and cons of a huge business hotel, plus the added value of sweeping vistas from its rooms, due to its unusual height (116 metres) versus the Paris average. \u20ac165+. \n\n\nConnect\n\n\nGo next",
