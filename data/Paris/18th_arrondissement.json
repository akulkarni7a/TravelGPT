  "extract": "The 18th arrondissement of Paris is probably best known for the hill of Montmartre which was the centre of the Communard uprising of the late-nineteenth century, but is also perhaps better known as the centre of the flourishing artist community of the period from around 1907-1914. Picasso, Dali, Duchamp, Toulouse-Lautrec, and others from the vibrant early modern period lived and worked here until driven out either by political considerations during the First World War or rising property values thereafter. The 18th arrondissement is also the home of a thriving ethnic community in the east and was a sort of a red-light district along Boulevard de Clichy near Place Pigalle.\n\n\nGet in\n\nMany of the hotels in the 18th arrondissement are within walking distance of Gare du Nord, so if you are arriving from the UK, Belgium, or the Netherlands, consider walking or taking a taxi should you arrive at night, or with luggage.\n\n\nBy M\u00e9tro\nFrom other parts of Paris, your best bet is to arrive by M\u00e9tro. The 18th is primarily served by the M\u00e9tro 4 and 12 lines from the centre of town, or the 2 from the east and west.\n\n\nStations of note\nAbbesses The station is fairly high up the slope of the hill, and the line is fairly deep underground, so getting up and down is part of the fun either in a seven-storey spiral staircase decorated from top to bottom with murals by local amateur painters, or in one of two high-capacity modern lifts. If you have time and good knees the choice is clear.\n\n\nLines\nLine  2  stops at stations from west to east: Place de Clichy, Blanche, Pigalle, Anvers, and Barb\u00e8s-Rochechouart.\nLine  4  has stops at stations from south to north: Barb\u00e8s-Rochechouart and  Chateau Rouge.\nLine  12  has stop at stations from south to north: Pigalle, Abbesses\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n\n1 Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur (La Basilique du Sacr\u00e9 Coeur de Montmartre) (Anvers  2  or Abbesses  12 , then climb the stairs on Rue Foyatier or take the funicular to the top of the hill). Daily, 06:00-23:00. This wedding cake-white church rises visibly above the north part of Paris. The striking building, with its towers and white onion dome (83 m high), was built between 1875-1914 on the birthplace of La Commune, officially as an act of penitence for the sins committed during the civil war in which thousands of Communards were executed, as well as for the previous bloodshed of the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. A number of prominent businessmen put up the money, and a dizzying combination of architects worked to put together the mock Romano-Byzantine extravaganza. Consecration followed in 1919. The view over Paris from the dome and from the square before it (200 m above sea level) is unsurpassed, apart from that enjoyed at the Eiffel Tower (50 km on a clear day). For the athletic traveller there are stairs from several directions to the top of the hill; otherwise there is also a funicular which runs every few minutes during the daytime from Place St. Pierre. Follow the signs that say \"Funiculaire De Montmartre\". Beware that the guards don't like it if they catch you taking pictures inside and will even yell \"No photo!\" and chase you down if they see you with a camera. Be warned: along the lower steps leading up to church, groups of mostly young African men gather and reach toward you with a small string, offering to loop it round your finger. In case it happens, pull back your hand, brush them off and move on. They might claim that \"This is for the church.\" In case your feel that things go sideways, raise your voice to get people's attention and ask them call the police.   \n2 Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre (Montmartre Cemetery), rue de la Barri\u00e8re Blanch (M\u00e9tro Place de Clichy). There are a number of famous occupants, but the real reason to visit this cemetery is to see the ornate tombstones, sculptures, and other sometimes macabre, sometimes touching memorials Parisians have left here for their dead.   \n3 Artists' Square, place du Tertre. Numerous artists paint portraits of tourists and also sell their paintings.   \n4 Place Pigalle (On the border with the 9th). The sleaze of boulevard de Clichy between place Pigalle and place Blanche can provide a moment of distraction. Be warned if you are male it is better to do this in the company of a female fellow traveller, as the clubs often send the girls outside to attempt to physically drag passing men off of the street. These strip clubs are big ripoffs. They tempt you with a free drink for \u20ac10 entry; once in the girl who starts dancing orders a couple of drinks (Red Bull) and then before you realise you are presented with a bill ranging from \u20ac500-700. They have these big bouncers who threaten/manhandle you till you arrive at some settlement with them. The whole of Pigalle is a rip off, best avoided. The police know about these places but nothing is done.   \n5 Moulin de la Galette, Rue Lepic 83. Built in 1717, the windmill is now part of a restaurant of the same name, and is easily visible from the street.  (updated Jun 2020)\n6 Moulin Blute-Fin, Rue Lepic (opposite Rue Tholoz\u00e9). The windmill is within fenced private property, and may be difficult to see from the street expecially if there are leaves on the nearby trees. It is near the more visible Moulin de la Galette. (updated Jun 2020)\n\n\nMuseums and galleries\n7 Espace Dali, 11, rue Poulbot (place du Tertre) (M\u00e9tro Anvers, Abbesses, Bus 54, 80, Montmartrobus, Funiculaire - depart from M\u00e9tro Anvers), \u260f +33 1 42 64 40 10, fax: +33 1 42 64 93 17. Sep-Jun: 10:00-18:00 daily; Jul-Aug: 10:00-20:00 daily. Guided tours 15:00. A fantastic and undeservedly little-known collection of the great surrealist artist's often overlooked sculptural works. Those travellers seeking a more authentic experience should be warned that the majority of works here are reproductions, and that this \"museum\" is more appropriately considered as a for-profit, tourist-oriented homage to the artist rather than a carefully curated collection of original work. To find it, head up to Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur and stand facing it and take a left. Keep your eye out for small Dali signs. Admission \u20ac11 adults, \u20ac7 seniors 60+, \u20ac6 children and students under 26, free for children under 8.   \n8 Mus\u00e9e de Montmartre, 12 Rue Cortot. The museum is located in a 17th century house with a garden, and features the history and culture of Montmartre. Several famous artists had lived in the house including Renoir.  (updated Jun 2020)\n\n\nOther\n\n9 \"I love you\" wall (Le mur des je t'aime) (Near Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur). Wall with the words for \"I love you\" written in many languages.   (updated Nov 2016)\n10 Abbesses m\u00e9tro station, Place des Abbesses. The station's beautiful entrance (circa 1900) is one of only two remaining glass-covered \"dragonfly\" entrances designed by Hector Guimard (1867\u20131942). It was featured in the film Le Fabuleux destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain. While the entrance is genuine, this is not an authentic location for it, as the station was originally constructed by an independent Metro company that did not use Guimard's entrances.  (updated Jun 2020)\n11 Villa L\u00e9andre. Villa L\u00e9andre is a short residential street where the houses have small front gardens giving the street an English look. (updated Jun 2020)\n12 Vigne du Clos Montmartre. Montmartre has a small vineyard which can be seen through a chain-linked fence. One of its products (vin Clos Montmartre) can be purchased at the nearby Mus\u00e9e de Montmartre. (updated Jun 2020)\n13 Buste de Dalida, Place Dalida. Dalida was a chanteuse and actrice who sold 170 million albums and singles worldwide. The bust faces the attractive Rue de l'Abreuvoir. The breast area of her bronze bust has a bleached colour possibly due attention given by overly enthusiastic admirers.  (updated Jun 2020)\n14 Le Passe-Muraille, Place Marcel Aym\u00e9. The sculture of a man walking through a store wall like a ghost was inspired by a novel by Marcel Aym\u00e9 about a civil servant who takes revenge on people who humiliated him after he discovered he could pass through walls. (updated Jun 2020)\n\n\nDo\n1 Le Moulin Rouge, place Blanche (M\u00e9tro Blanche). With two shows a night, this turn-of-the-20th century burlesque palace offers a big production choreographed dance show interspersed with comedians, jugglers, and magicians. The show is more than bilingual, actually playing up the U.S. 4th infantry's involvement in the lib\u00e9ration for the sake of the large number of Americans in the audience. If you want to spend more you can have dinner there. Is the Moulin Rouge a tourist trap? Well... it was meant to be one in the first place, so the experience is genuine. It's not cheap: the 21:00 show costs \u20ac95 and the 23:00 show costs \u20ac89.   \n Cooking with Class (13), 21, rue Custine. Hands on French cooking classes in a relaxed atmosphere with an experienced French chef. 4 hours of fun, including market visit, cheese and wine tasting, 5 minutes from the Sacre Coeur in the heart of Montmartre. \n M\u00f4m'artre, 44, rue Joseph de Maistre, \u260f +33 1 42 28 82 27.

Widely-acclaimed as the largest flea market in all of Europe, in existence since 1885, this sprawling bazaar is made up of both permanent stalls and temporary stands (over 2,000 of them), arranged in winding, sometimes chaotic arcades, over 15 km of walkways, and over 10 differently-themed sub-markets. Everything from fine antiques through to collectible kitsch and bric-a-brac. Big on retro fashion also. Very popular with tourists, making it more difficult here to find a real bargain, but it is always worth looking. Convenient, competitive shipping is available at the market to send your precious finds back home all over the world. Be prepared to bargain! \n Ouistitipop, 19 rue Ramey (M\u00e9tro Chateau Rouge), \u260f +33 1 42 58 03 54. Tu-Sa 10:00-18:00. New and used kids' clothing, toys, strollers and furniture.

Hip and trendy bazaar that features designs and clothes from all around the world.

The grocery store featured in the film Le Fabuleux destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain still functions as such but also displays memorabilia from the film in its windows, and sells some as souvenirs. (updated Jun 2020)\n\n\nEat\n\n\nBudget\n Nawab, 174, rue Ordener (M\u00e9tro: Guy M\u00f4quet), \u260f +33 1-46-27-85-28, nawab75018@outlook.fr. Daily, 12\u02d000-14\u02d000 & 19\u02d000-23\u02d000. This Indian and Pakistani restaurant is usually packed especially for lunch so be sure to call ahead and reserve a table. One of the reasons is that if you ask them to spice it up \"like in Pakistan\" they actually will. \u20ac15. \n Le Surcouf, 36, Avenue de Saint Ouen (Metro: La Fourche), \u260f +33 1-46-27-11-85. Very ordinary non-touristy cafe run by family from the Maghreb. \"French\" food is pricey for what you get, but the couscous dishes are huge, cheap and delicious with a home-cooked feel to them.

Booking a day ahead is suggested. \n Le Buffet, 18, rue des Trois Freres. unpredictable. Tasty, homey French food. It's a family place, I think. Lunch menu is around \u20ac12 (can be had until 20\u02d000). \n Cafe des Deux Moulins, 15, rue Lepic. A popular destination for those who love the film Le fabuleaux destin d'Amelie Poulain, yet some locals still come here. Interior preserves the movie set. Great for lunch. \n La Petaudiere, rue Poulbot. Piano bar. Tasty food, nice ambience, and excellent good piano music (prepare some coins for the pianist). \n Le Refuge des Fondues, 17, rue des Trois Fr\u00e8res, \u260f +33 1 42 55 22 65.

Small restaurant with a nice rustic decoration, just below the artist's square, place du Tertre. Relaxing place, not overloaded with tourists.

Run as part of the Laboratoire Multi-culturel populaire the Olympic Caf\u00e9 is one of the few places in Paris where you can reliably find avant-garde jazz, making it at least spiritually a descendant of the club where the Art Ensemble of Chicago were resident for 5 years or so in the early 1970s. In addition to jazz they book music from around the world, especially Africa and the Caribbean. \n Truc Caf\u00e9, 58, rue de Poteau, \u260f +33 101 42 52 64 09.
