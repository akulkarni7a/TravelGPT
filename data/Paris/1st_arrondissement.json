  "title": "Paris/1st arrondissement",
  "extract": "The centre of contemporary Paris and the site of such landmarks as the Louvre and of the Tuileries and Palais-Royal, the 1st arrondissement is full of attractions for travellers of all inclinations, including some of the finest parks, museums, shops, and bars in the city. The 1st occupies the Right Bank of the River Seine and extends onto the western section of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the midst of the river.\nFor occupying such a compact space, the 1st feels remarkably different from one end to the other. The almost incredibly upscale western end of the arrondissement gives way to the hustle and bustle of the big city east of the Palais Royal, and then further east to the pedestrian (and tourist) dominated area around Les Halles and the Samaritaine, where tourists mix with (especially young) Parisiens and Parisiennes in huge numbers (on the order of 800,000 unique visitors per day according to the Mayor's office).\nThe Axe historique is a line of landmarks, which passes through the 1st, extending out to La D\u00e9fense in the west, and the 4th arrondissement in the east.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nParis was historically centred on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, but by the time Baron von Hausmann was given the task of carving up the city, the centre had shifted somewhat to the previously suburban Royal Quarter surrounding the Louvre and the Palais Royal, which is why the numbering of the arrondissements started there.\nWith fewer than 18,000 inhabitants, the 1st is statistically the least populous and least densely inhabited of all the 20 arrondissements, but at the same time among the most visited by Parisians and out-of-towners alike. Like every other arrondissement, it is divided into four quartiers, each with a different character:\n\nQuartier Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois runs along the bank of the Seine across the district, encompassing the Tuileries gardens, the Louvre and the western part of Ile de la cit\u00e9.\nQuartier Les Halles has a markedly different, much more down-to-earth character, dominated by the eponymous massive Les Halles shopping centre (under redevelopment until 2016)\nQuartier Palais-Royal is dominated by the Palais Royal, and contains the larger part of the busy cosmopolitan Avenue de l'Opera.\nQuartier Place Vend\u00f4me in the west is centred around the Place Vend\u00f4me and characterized by a regular, 18th-century street grid. The quarter's historic buildings house the most luxurious hotels and boutiques of famous fashion and jewellery brands.\n\n\nGet in\n\nThe transportation hub of the 1st arrondissement is the 1 Ch\u00e2telet/Les Halles  A  B  D  1  4  7  11  14  station in its eastern extremity, the largest and busiest of the metro stations. There exists a total of seven entrances/exits scattered around the eastern end of the 1st Arrondissement, concentrated (not surprisingly) between Les Halles and Place du Ch\u00e2telet, and also accessing the basement of the Les Halles shopping mall.\nOther m\u00e9tro stations that are major hubs allowing easy access to the 1st arrondissement are the 2 Concorde  1  8  12  and 3 Madeleine  8  12  14 , both with exits at the western border of the 1st. Lines  1 ,  7  and  14  traverse the arrondissement roughly from east to west, stopping close to important points such as the entrance to the Louvre museum. Lines  1  and  14  are fully automated and it is worth acquainting oneself with their modus operandi and safety precautions before using them.\nRER C, which runs generally on the left bank of the Seine, does not stop in the 1st, but you can use it to arrive at 4 Musee d'Orsay  C  and cross the Seine in style over the Passerelle Solferino footbridge right into the Tuileries.\nThe 5 Pyramides metro station is at the Rue de Pyramides, not at the pyramid at the entrance of the Louvre. For that pyramid and the entrance to the museum, travel to the station called 6 Palais Royal / Musee de Louvre.\n\n\nArriving from specific points\nFrom Charles de Gaulle (Roissy) Airport (CDG), take RER B3 to Ch\u00e2telet/Les-Halles.\nFrom Gare du Nord (where many high-speed international trains arrive, including the Eurostar from London), the direct connections are pretty much exclusively those with Ch\u00e2telet/Les-Halles on  B  D  or  4 \nFrom Gare de Lyon and Orly Airport (starting on June 2024), take  14 , which stops at Ch\u00e2telet/Les-Halles and Pyramides\nFrom La D\u00e9fense, take  1  and alight at any station within the 1st, e.g., Palais-Royale/Mus\u00e9e-de-Louvre or Tuileries\n\n\nGet around\n\nHaving arrived in the 1st arrondissement walking will most likely suffice for transport. Paris cabs are quite cheap, but even they don't have access to much of the car-free eastern end of the arrondissement.\nIf travelling from east to west by M\u00e9tro you are probably better off using any station other than Ch\u00e2telet/Les Halles unless you have to connect there.  Although the M\u00e9tro trains are fast and frequent, the crowded labyrinth at Ch\u00e2telet can make getting to the trains an adventure.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nLandmarks\n1 Colonne Vend\u00f4me (Op\u00e9ra  3  7  8 ). The centrepiece of a magnificent 8-sided square first laid out in 1699 to show off an equestrian statue of the Sun King, Louis XIV. The statue was removed amid revolutionary fervor in 1792 and replaced in 1806 with the Colonne de la Grande Arm\u00e9e. This was modelled on Trajan's column in Rome and decorated with Napoleon's military exploits. The present column is a replica, however, as the original was pulled down during the 1871 Paris Commune. Place Vend\u00f4me represents the best of well-heeled Paris, being home to an abundance of exclusive boutiques, jewellers and fashion labels\u2014Cartier, Boucheron, Trussardi, van Cleef & Arpels\u2014several banks, the French Ministry of Justice, and the H\u00f4tel Ritz.   \n2 La Conciergerie (Cit\u00e9  4 ), \u260f +33 1 53 73 78 50. Apr-Sep: daily 09:30-18:30; Oct- Mar: daily 10:00-17:00. The ancient medieval fortress and prison of the city's island, site of some remarkable medieval royal architecture and the scene of Marie Antoinette's imprisonment in the period leading to her execution in 1793; lots of revolutionary associations. \u20ac6.10, concessions and guided tours available, under-18 free.   \n3 \u00c9glise Saint-Eustache (Les Halles  4 ). The massive parish church of the Les Halles area is a notable example of late Gothic interspersed with Renaissance details (including the entire front fa\u00e7ade), as it was only completed in the 17th century. Its unique form results from a combination of relatively short length and impressive height of over 30 metres inside. The latter allows room not only for an array of stained glass windows and paintings, but also France's largest church organ of 8,000 pipes. The sculpture \u00c9coute, depicting an oversized human head, was placed in front of the church's southern facade and has become a favourite photo spot.   \n4 Jardin des Tuileries (Tuileries  1 ). Built adjoining the now-lost royal palace of the Tuileries, these gardens lying immediately west of the Louvre offer a central open space for Parisians and visitors with semi-formal gardens (an outdoor gallery for modern sculpture), various caf\u00e9s, ice cream and cr\u00e9pe stalls, and a summer fun fair. The gardens are frequently home to a giant Ferris wheel and enclose the Mus\u00e9e de la Orangerie and the Jeu de Paume.   \n\n5 Le Palais Royal (Palais Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre  1  7 ), \u260f +33 1 45 20 82 56. 07:00-23:00 during the summer and 07:00-20:30 in the winter with hours varying spring and autumn. Ordered by Cardinal de Richelieu (1585-1642), King Louis XIII's prime Minister in 1629 (completed in 1636); originally called Palais Cardinal; it became Le Palais Royal when Anne d'Autriche, Louis XIII's wife, came to live here to get away from the Louvre palace. It eventually housed Louis XIV until the move to Versailles. It includes also a beautiful garden Les jardins du Palais Royal, enclosed by the buildings. It's been the theatre of one of the seminal events of the French Revolution (Camille Desmoulins made a famous declaration here in 1789). The Th\u00e9atre Fran\u00e7ais nearby was built in 1716. There are numerous restaurants inside the garden , including famous Le Grand V\u00e9four. There's also the controversial Colonnes de Buren, striped columns installed within the inside yard amid the 17th century architecture.   \n6 Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, 2 place du Louvre (Louvre-Rivoli  1 , Pont-Neuf  7 ), \u260f +33 1 42 60 13 96, stgermainauxerrois@free.fr. This Gothic church functioned until the 19th century as the parish church of the kings of France. In this role, the church has sometimes played a gruesome part in history. Its bell called 'Marie' sounded on the night of 23 August 1572, to launch the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed by Catholic mobs. Nowadays, the church is peaceful and an active parish church for commoners (the monarchy having long since given way to the Republic), and well worth visiting.   (updated Jul 2016)\n7 Sainte-Chapelle, 4 blvd du Palais (Cit\u00e9  4 ), \u260f +33 1 53 73 8 51. Soaring stained glass windows beaming ample light onto the rich primary colours of the tile mosaics on the floor, this photogenic church was built by the French kings to house the relics of the Crown of Thorns. Make sure you go on a sunny day, as the highlight of this small chapel in Rayonnante Gothic style are the large stained-glass windows which soar up to near the vaulted ceiling. Also of interest is the extremely ornate lower level. If it happens to be rainy or cloudy, give Sainte-Chapelle a miss, as the play of coloured lights on the floor is well worth the wait for a sunnier day. As the chapelle is inside the Courts of Justice, there will thus be a security check.   \n\n8 La Samaritaine, 19, rue de la Monnaie (Pont Neuf  7 ). La Samaritaine is one of Paris's greatest department stores located in a spectacular art nouveau building dating back to 1870. It reopened on June 23, 2021 after a 16-year closure for renovations.   (updated Jun 2021)\n\n\nMuseums and galleries\n9 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Place du Carrousel (Palais Royal-Mus\u00e9e du Louvre  1  7 ), \u260f +33 1 40 20 53 17. W-M 09:00-18:00, closed public holidays; evening openings W and F until 21:45. Its exhibits come from such diverse origins as ancient Egypt, classical Greece and the Roman Empire, medieval Europe, and Napoleonic France, but controversially including many items that were looted from their places of origin. Its most famous exhibit, of course, is Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa (French: La Joconde, Italian: La Gioconda), generally to be found surrounded by hordes of camera-flashing tourists. The Louvre poses many of the same challenges to the visitor as Paris itself; overwhelming in size, crowded in high seasons, and much information available only in French. If you want to see everything in the Louvre, plan at least two full days. However, it is better to pick and choose, as the collection was assembled with an eye to completeness rather than quality. As of July 2019, due to intense crowding and reports of ticket fraud, entry now almost always requires a pre-booked timed ticket, even for holders of the Paris Museum Pass. \u20ac12-16; under 18, free; EU-residents, 18-26 years free; exhibitions in the Hall Napol\u00e9on \u20ac13; combined ticket (museum + special exhibitions) adults \u20ac16 Carte Mus\u00e9e.   \n10 L'Orangerie (Mus\u00e9e de la Orangerie) (Concorde  1  8  12 ), \u260f +33 1 44 77 80 07. W-M (closed Christmas Day and 1 May) individuals 12:30-19:00, Th till 21:00; groups, 09:30-12:30;. Reopened after extensive renovations, this small museum near the Louvre houses the Jean Walter and Paul Guillaume Collection, sold to the French Republic on very generous terms and numbering 143 paintings from the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century (15 C\u00e9zannes, 24 Renoirs, 10 Matisses, 12 Picassos, 28 Derains, 22 Soutines). The collection joined the eight immense Water Lilies that Monet gave France in 1922 and which have been displayed since 1927 in two huge oval rooms purpose-built on the artist's instructions. Adults, \u20ac7.50; concessions, \u20ac5; special exhibitions, + \u20ac1.20; audio guides available in several languages \u20ac4.50/\u20ac3.   \n11 Jeu de Paume (Concorde  1  8  12 ; NW corner of the Jardin des Tuileries). Built during the First Empire, in imitation of the Orangerie, this small building is used by the Galerie Nationale to display temporary exhibitions of art photography, either contemporary or historic. This museum once housed many of the Impressionist painters that are now to be found in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay on the other side of the River Seine.   \n12 Mus\u00e9e des Arts d\u00e9coratifs, 107, rue de Rivoli (Palais Royal \u2013 Mus\u00e9e du Louvre  1  7 ), \u260f +33 1 44 55 57 50. A monument to the French art de vivre, housed in a 19th-century wing of the Louvre that has been restored to beaux-arts splendour, its galleries and period rooms showcase eight centuries of Gallic taste in interior decoration.   \n13 Mus\u00e9e en Herbe, 21, rue H\u00e9rold (M\u00e9tro: Les Halles  4 , Palais Royal  1  7 , Rambuteau  11 , Sentier  3 ), \u260f +33 1 40 67 97 66. Daily 10:00-19:00. The little brother of the original Mus\u00e9e en Herbe in the Bois de Boulogne, this museum is also geared to children. They have games and hands-on exhibits, so you won't have to supervise quite as closely as in other museums. Arts workshops are available as well, but you'll need to reserve a space in advance. \u20ac4 for the exhibitions, \u20ac8 for the workshops.   \n14 Bourse de commerce - Pinault Collection (Commodities Exchange Building), 2 rue de Viarmes (M\u00e9tro: Les Halles  4 , Louvre-Rivoli  1 ), \u260f +33 1 55 04 60 60, info.boursedecommerce@pinaultcollection.com. W-Mo 11:00-19:00. Closed Tu. Fr and first Sa of month late opening until 21:00. Since 2021 the 18th-century former Bourse de Commerce building has been the Paris home of the art collection of the French business magnate Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, showing a rotating selection of contemporary artworks either newly commissioned or taken from his collection. \u20ac14 full price, \u20ac10 reductions, free first Saturday of month after 1700.   (updated Sep 2022)\n\n\nDo\n\nOne of the great joys of a visit to Paris is to simply walk around and explore to get the feel of the city. The 1st is as good a place to start as any, with the largely car-free section around Les Halles, and the right bank of the river Seine as good places to start. As a little bonus if you are in Paris in the summer time, the express lanes at river level are converted to an all pedestrian road called \"Paris Plage\" which fills with rollerbladers and sun-bathers just about every afternoon.\nA number of Paris theaters are located in the eastern end of the 1st. English language productions are not unheard of, but the opera is likely to be in Italian anyhow. Your best bet if you are interested in finding a show in either language is to pick up a copy of Pariscope which you can find at any newsstand for around \u20ac0.50. There are ticket outlets at Forum Les Halles (FNAC) among other locations.\n\n1 Com\u00e9die Francaise (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, La maison de Moli\u00e8re), 1 Place Colette (Palais Royal - Mus\u00e9e du Louvre), informations@comedie-francaise.org. The theatre is one of the rare state theatres in France. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. It was enlarged and modified in the 1800s, then rebuilt in 1900 after a severe fire. The played repertoires sum to around 3,000 works.   \n2 \u00d4 Chateau, Paris Wine Tasting. Discover French wines with a native French sommelier. Informative, relaxing, and fun.

Also fancy hats, scarfs and gloves. \n2 Carrefour Express Paris Saint Honor\u00e9, 205, rue saint Honor\u00e9, \u260f +33 1 49 26 04 28. M-Sa 08:00-22:00; Su 08:00-13:00. A small version of the French Carrefour supermarket chain has the appearance of a neighbourhood shop, with stalls filled with fresh fruit and vegetables on its shopfront, and is about the only place to get reasonably-priced nourishment and beverages on the go when visiting the Vend\u00f4me area. \n3 Le Carrousel du Louvre, 99 Rue de Rivoli. A diverse underground shopping precinct adjoining the Louvre Museum. Open daily including Sundays. There is also a direct access into the Louvre. \n4 Forum les Halles, 101 Rue Berger (M\u00e9tro: Les Halles). Daily 09:00-19:00. In the late 1960s what was Paris's primary farmers' market moved out to the suburbs to be replaced by a park above ground, and a sprawling underground shopping centre below. The interior design is strikingly period (think Logan's Run). The place is showing its age now, but still draws nearly a half-million Parisians per day, mostly teenagers. There's a movie theatre and a media library too. Les Halles underwent extensive refurbishment in 2016.   \n5 Jean-Paul H\u00e9vin, 231, rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (M\u00e9tro Tuileries), \u260f +33 1 55 35 35 96.

(updated Jul 2016)\n\n\nEat\nThe 1st provides rather a wide range of eating possibilities, considering its central location and overall poshness. A large variety of inexpensive food is sold out of windows and stalls, especially on the car-free east end of the arrondissement near Les Halles. You'll always pay a bit more to sit down, of course.\nOn the other hand if you are looking for a nice posh place to take your mom or a date there are plenty, and some of them actually have food that is good enough to be worth the considerable prices.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Filakia, Petit Caf\u00e9 d'Ath\u00e8nes, 9 Rue Mandar.

Hemingway tried to drink here once per week even before he made it big. In August 1944 Hemingway made a booze-powered drive into Paris ahead of the advancing Free French 2nd Tank Division to \"liberate the Ritz\", and specifically the bar which was shortly thereafter renamed in his honour. Today the bar is considered by many to be one of the best bars in the world, in no small part due to the bar-tending skills of Colin Field, who creates elaborate cocktails as a fine art, and with the rest of the staff is skilled at bringing his guests together in conversation. Expect to pay \u20ac30 or more per drink. \n2 Caf\u00e9 Oz (Caf\u00e9 Oz Ch\u00e2telet), 18, rue Saint Denis (Metro: Chatelet), \u260f +33 1 40 39 00 18, chatelet@australian-bar.com. You probably didn't think you were coming to Paris to sample Australian culture, but if after a long day of strolling from one end of the city to another you would just like to let go a bit and meet up with some fellow anglophones then you could do a lot worse than this almost legendarily hard-partying Aussie joint (ask the neighbours). Warning: as with other Aussie places in Paris for some reason, weekend nights here tend to bring out hoards of young single Frenchmen looking to chat up some (any) visiting sheilas. This has been known to lead to, um, confrontations. ~\u20ac7 pints. \n3 Juv\u00e9nile's, 47, rue Richelieu, \u260f +33 1 42 97 46 49. The bistro serves many different wines from around the world and tapas. You can buy a bottle to take home if you like it. \n4 Willi's Wine Bar, 13, rue des Petits Champs, \u260f +33 1 42 61 05 09. It's actually a restaurant and is more upscale than Juv\u00e9niles, serving good food and good-to-great bottles of wine with a focus on the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, but including many from Burgundy, the Loire, as well as Italians, and \"Atlantic crossing\" Californians. The dinner menu by chef Fran\u00e7ois Yon Great won the \"Bib Gourmet 2009\" award, and there are cheeses & desserts (yummy crumble) for after. Reservations recommended. \u20ac20.50-35. \n\n\nSleep\n\nSome of the most opulent hotels in the world are either in or very close to the 1st arrondissement, and there's some choice in the mid-range. Budget travellers, on the other hand, are probably better off in other, less central parts of town.\nDuring fashion weeks, hotels, especially the 1st, are occupied by trade professionals and visitors, as well as brand showrooms. Finding a room can be a challenge and the rates go sky-high. Consult Paris Fashion Week for fashion week dates and avoid them if you do not want to clash with it.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Centre International BVJ Paris-Louvre, 20, rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau (M\u00e9tro: Louvre), \u260f +33 1 53 00 90 90, fax: +33 1 53 00 90 91. This is just about as cheap as it's going to get in the 1st. If you are here to study at the Louvre, and want to stay focused it has a location which can't be beat, just across rue Rivoli. \u20ac26+. \n2 Hotel Karraz, 12, rue Mond\u00e9tour (M\u00e9tro: Les Halles), \u260f +33 1 40 26 25 40, fax: +33 1 40 26 22 02, apparthotel@hotmail.fr. Next to Les Halles Metro Station. \n3 H\u00f4tel Montpensier, 12, rue de Richelieu, \u260f +33 1 42 96 28 50, fax: +33 1 42 86 02 70. Another semi-cheapie right in the middle of everything. \n4 H\u00f4tel Saint-Honor\u00e9, 85, rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (M\u00e9tro: Louvre), \u260f +33 1 42 36 20 38. Close to the Louvre. The place was renovated in the last few years, so the comfort level is pretty good considering it hasn't received a star rating yet. \n\n\nMid-range\n\n5 H\u00f4tel Brighton, 218, rue de Rivoli. The executive and deluxe rooms offer a breathtaking views of the Louvre, the Jardin des Tuileries, and the Eiffel Tower. Classic Parisian-style hotel next to shopping and cultural hot spots. Double from \u20ac229. \n6 H\u00f4tel Britannique, 20, av Victoria (M\u00e9tro: Chat\u00ealet), \u260f +33 1 42 33 74 59, fax: +33 1 42 33 82 65. Anglophiles in Paris could do worse than to stay at this most Anglophile of French hotels. The location is good, at the very east end of the 1st. Double from \u20ac157. \n7 H\u00f4tel Louvre Bon Enfants (H\u00f4tel le Loiret), 5, rue des Bons-Enfants (M\u00e9tro: Palais-Royal), \u260f +33 1 42 61 47 31. Most reviewers give the hotel very high marks for cleanliness and comfort, but the real draw is the location: only steps from the Palais Royal/Louvre stop on M\u00e9tro Line 1. Single rooms start at \u20ac90, doubles around \u20ac110. \n8 H\u00f4tel Mansart, 5, rue des Capucines. This charming 3-star hotel is next to the Place Vend\u00f4me and 2 minutes' walk from the Opera Garnier and famous Parisian department stores. Antique furniture and paintings create an atmosphere of typical Parisian house. \n9 H\u00f4tel de la Place du Louvre, 21, rue des Pr\u00eatres Saint Germain l'Auxerrois. As its name suggests, this hotel is really close to the Louvre. Rooms on the street offer an impressive view on the Louvre. (updated Jun 2017)\n10 H\u00f4tel Victoria Ch\u00e2telet, 17 Avenue Victoria (M\u00e9tro: Chat\u00ealet), \u260f +33 1 40 26 90 17, fax: +33 1 40 26 35 61. A cozy, competitively priced 24 room hotel with a friendly Art Deco atmosphere. It is located next to the Chatelet Theatre in the very centre of Paris across from Notre Dame. It is close to bus, taxi, Metro and RER stations: Chatelet les Halles, as well as three nearby monitored parking garages. Basic rooms start at \u20ac89 and doubles at \u20ac90. \n11 Milestay Paris Les Halles, 4 rue des Halles (Metro & RER : Chatelet - Les Halles), \u260f +33140138580, contact@milestay.com. Check-in: 15h, check-out: 11h. Modern aparthotel with 9 furnished apartments, from budget studios to 2BR duplex. Various amenities including AC, kitchen and digital concierge. From \u20ac140. (updated Feb 2019)\n12 Novotel Paris Les Halles, 8 Place Marguerite de Navarre. Renovated to Novotel's newest standards, it is one of the brand's flagships and earns consistently good reviews. While much cheaper than the luxury hotels closer to Place Vend\u00f4me, it is one of the pricier Novotels in Paris, if not the world. \n\n\nSplurge\n\n13 Castille Paris, 33-37 rue Cambon, \u260f +33 144 584 458. In the fashion district of Paris, the Castille Paris offers chic rooms that all look out onto the Rue Cambon. Some rooms are designed in a \"Coco Chanel\" style with beige and black tones. \u20ac350-820.   \n14 H\u00f4tel Costes, 239, rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 (M\u00e9tro: Concorde), \u260f +33 1 42 44 50 00, fax: +33 1 42 55 50 01. When the Costes brothers, who made their fortune in the Paris caf\u00e9 trade, opened this designer hotel a couple of years ago it became an instant hit with the rich and famous, especially those of Hollywood. Whether it's worth the price for the exquisite interior decoration and the chance to rub elbows with a few movie stars is up to you to decide. They don't pay travel agent commissions, so either book it yourself, or pony up the extra \u20ac50 the agent would normally get. A basic room starts at \u20ac500 off-season.   \n15 H\u00f4tel Ritz, 15 Place Vend\u00f4me (M\u00e9tro: Pyramides), \u260f +33 1 43 16 30 70, fax: +33 1 43 16 36 68, resa@ritzparis.com. If there is any one hotel in the world which is not merely \"putting on\" the Ritz it would be this one, whose very name has entered the English language as a generic word for luxury (or the appearance thereof). The Ritz may not in fact be the fanciest hotel in Paris anymore, but it's always in the running. It's 350 times the price of a budget room in the neighborhood, but heck, maybe it's your honeymoon. \u20ac650-8,500.   \n16 H\u00f4tel de Vend\u00f4me, 1, Place Vend\u00f4me (M\u00e9tro: Pyramides), \u260f +33 1 55 04 55 00, reservations@hoteldevendome.com. Occupying a building which was once the site of the Embassy of the Republic of Texas, the H\u00f4tel de Vend\u00f4me is one of the most exclusive addresses anywhere, much like the neighbouring Ritz. The 29 rooms each have been decorated in the style of a different period, such as Classic, Baroque, or Deco. Singles start at \u20ac350; suites can be as much as \u20ac4,000. \n17 H\u00f4tel Du Louvre, a Hyatt Hotel, Place Andr\u00e9 Malraux. The hotel, built in 1855, is a brand itself enough for Hyatt to take second place to it. The hotel is a cornerstone for the Unbound Collection, a new Hyatt sub-brand created for notable properties, many of which pre-date the Hyatt chain itself. It is literally next to the Louvre and keeps the belle epoque charm alive throughout the property, albeit remaining contemporary and not pretentious. The Brasserie, where breakfasts are served, has a terrace with a splendid direct view of the Louvre.   (updated Nov 2018)\n18 Le Meurice, 228, Rue De Rivoli. In business since 1815 and founded to cater to English travellers, Le Meurice has a rare distinction of being considered an actual palace by the French government (yes, they do regulate such things). Refurbished many times, the last time in 2007 by Philippe Stark, it has followed the changing demands of travellers yet retains numerous artefacts of its long history. Both its rooms and its famous ground-floor restaurant are frequent haunts of celebrities of all sorts, and it becomes a true potpourri of famous faces during the Paris Fashion Weeks.   \n19 Renaissance Paris Vend\u00f4me Hotel, 4 Rue Du Mont Thabor. Hidden in a side street and slightly demure, the Renaissance offers a welcome break from the revival-furniture-and-chandelier-filled surrounding hotels. Tasteful decor and quality service make up for the fact that some rooms are on the small side. \n20 The Westin Paris Vend\u00f4me, 3 rue de Castiglione, \u260f +33 1 44 77 11 11. A favourite with wealthy Russian tourists, the Westin Vend\u00f4me seems almost like a poor relative to other luxury hotels in the district, and certainly rises above the chain's average to match them. Not all rooms are created equal, and to get the best, one needs to shell out a significant supplement for the Tuileries view and high floor. All rooms are quite large by Parisian standards, though. The hotel has a sizeable area devoted to function rooms, and there is almost always something happening inside. When not closed for an event, the Summer Terrace is a highlight.   \n\n\nConnect\n\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s\n1 La Baguenaude, 30, rue Grande-Truanderie (M\u00e9tro: Les Halles), \u260f +33 1 40 26 27 74, info@labaguenaude.com. M-Sa 10:00-20:45. This all SUSE Linux shop offers courses in the use of KDE and GIMP (in French). 1/2 hr \u20ac2.30; 1 hr \u20ac3.80; 2 hr \u20ac6.10. (updated Jan 2017)\n2 Milk Les Halles, 31 bd S\u00e9bastopol (Ch\u00e2telet/Les Halles  A  B  D  1  4  7  11  14  or Rambuteau  11 ), \u260f +33 1 42 33 68 17. Huge business workspace, gaming and e-sport facility in central Paris owned by technology giant Asus. More than 800m2 with 150+ high-end workstations. Private rooms available. Temple of Gamers as they say. Full printing, binding and laminating services available 24/7. Payment packages are valid for a year. Online ticketing available. \u20ac4.50/1 hour and up. (updated Dec 2020)\n\n\nWireless hotspots\nThere are a number of caf\u00e9s in each arrondissement which offer free wireless for customers (for 20 min at a time). In the 1st:\n\n Chez Flottes, 2, rue Cambon (M\u00e9tro: Concorde). \n Caf\u00e9 du Pont Neuf, 14, quai du Louvre (M\u00e9tro: Pont Neuf). \n Le Commerce, 12, rue Coquill\u00e8re (M\u00e9tro: Etienne Marcel). \n Tabac du Ch\u00e2telet, 8, rue St Denis (M\u00e9tro: Ch\u00e2telet). \n\nOf course many hotels also offer wireless connectivity, but usually for a fee.\n\n\nGo next",
