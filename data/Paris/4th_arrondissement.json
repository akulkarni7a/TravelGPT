  "extract": "The 4th is a good chunk of what used to be medieval Paris, and you'll find a lot left from that time on both islands and in the narrow streets of the lower Marais.  Meanwhile there's lots that's contemporary to look at especially at the Centre Georges Pompidou where you'll find a lot of the very best contemporary art.\nAt night the 4th has several of the most active bar scenes most travellers will have ever seen, including the lower Marais district which is sometimes known as gay Paris although there are no shortage of bars catering to straight singles or a mixed crowd, or, in the early evening, families.\nThe 4th has the eastern end of the Axe historique, which extends westwards to La D\u00e9fense.\n\n\nGet in\nThe 4th is a central arrondissement, right between the Ch\u00e2telet and Bastille areas, two of Paris' main transportation (metro, RER and bus) hubs.\n\n\nBy car\nBeing such a touristy district, it is very hard to find parking spaces. It's much easier to use the Metro.\n\n\nBy metro\nH\u00f4tel de Ville  1  11  (La Defense/Chateau de Vincennes, and Chatelet/Mairie des Lilas respectively) - Access from near the junction of Rue de Renard and Rue de Rivoli.\nCit\u00e9  4  (Porte d'Orleans (General Leclerc)/Porte de Clignancourt) - Access off the Boulevard du Palais (infront of Palais de Justice on the Ile de Cit\u00e9).\nSt. Paul  1  (La Defense/Chateau de Vincennes) - Access off the Rue de Rivoli.\nRambuteau  11  (Chatelet/Mairie des Lilas) - Access from near the junction of Rue de Renard and Rue Rambuteau.\nPt. Marie  7  (Villejuif - Louis Aragon / Mairie d'Ivry/La Courneuve - 8 mai 1945) - Access from Quai de l'Hotel de Ville\nSully Morland  7  (Villejuif - Louis Aragon / Mairie d'Ivry/La Courneuve - 8 mai 1945) - Access near the junction of Boulevard de Henri IV and Quai des Celestins.\n\n\nBy bus\nUnlike the metro, buses can be a great way of moving around and seeing the city's landscape, although you risk being caught in traffic. The most useful lines are 70, 72 and 74, which stop at the H\u00f4tel de Ville, and lines 75 and 76, which run through Rue de Rivoli.\nThe neighbouring Ch\u00e2telet and Bastille stations are also served by the Noctilian (night bus), running from 00:30 to 05:30. Lines 33, 34 and 132 run between these two stations with no intermediate stops, but there are many others arriving and leaving from both to several destinations around town.\n\n\nGet around\n\nWalk, walk and walk! This arrondissement is compact enough to be explored on foot and that's probably just what you'll want to do anyway. Otherwise, the metro may be not be too useful for covering short distances, but you may still want to use the bus line 76 for the Ch\u00e2telet-Bastille itinerary or line 67 for Ch\u00e2telet - \u00cele St. Louis, especially if you have a card for multiple trips or a Carte Orange.\nThe RATP network has bicycles (v\u00e9los) for rent next to the Bastille station:\n\n Maison Roue Libre, 37, bd Bourdon, \u260f +33 1 54 54 97 10. 09:00-19:00. \u20ac10-15 per day. \n\n\nSee\n\n\nPlaces and Areas\n\n1 Le Marais.   \n2 Place des Vosges. The oldest planned square in Paris, and what many tourists as well as locals consider the heart of the Marais area.   \n3 Rue des Rosiers. The Jewish quarter, with many small delis and shops. Lively on most days except for Saturdays.   \n4 \u00cele Saint-Louis.   \n\n\nLandmarks\n5 Notre-Dame de Paris (Notre Dame Cathedral), Ile de la Cit\u00e9 6, Place du Parvis Notre Dame (Cit\u00e9  4  or Saint-Michel-Notre Dame  B  C ), \u260f +33 1 42 34 56 10, fax: +33 1 40 51 70 98, info@cathedraleDeParis.com. Closed indefinitely due to the fire that occurred on 15 April 2019. The early Gothic Cath\u00e9drale de Notre Dame (Our Lady) has a 12th century design but wasn't completed until the 14th. Still it is a good example of the development of the style, though the west or main portal is a bit unusual in its rigidity. The April 2019 fire caused severe damage, but the main structure of Notre Dame, and its two towers, have been saved. The area around the remains of the building will be unsafe and off limits for an undetermined period.   (updated Apr 2019)\n6 H\u00f4tel de Ville (Town Hall), Place de la H\u00f4tel de Ville (Metro: H\u00f4tel de Ville). Many feel that this, Paris' town hall, is one of the loveliest buildings in the city. You might not get that from the front view, but try watching the light change on its roofs and towers during sunset from one of the caf\u00e9s on the Ile de St. Louis, the Lutece for instance. Alternatively, go to the top floor of the Bazar de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville (BHV) department store opposite, on rue de Rivoli and walk up a flight of stairs to the roof terrace (terrasse), from which there is a dramatic view of both the roof of the H\u00f4tel de Ville and the immediate surroundings and river. The present H\u00f4tel de Ville replaced the 16th century original which was burned down during the Commune in 1871. A pastiche of its predecessor, but on a far larger scale, it was designed by the architects Ballu and Deperthes, chosen after a competition, and was mostly completed by 1882. The building is lavishly, and some would say heavy-handedly, decorated both inside and out, and finished in an arrestingly white stone, similar to that used for the even more eye-catching Sacre-Coeur basilica. The statue on the garden wall on the south side is of Etienne Marcel, the most famous holder of the post of \"prev\u00f4t des marchands\" (provost of merchants) which pre-dated the office of mayor. Marcel came to a sticky end, lynched in 1358 by an angry mob after trying to assert the city's powers a little too energetically. The H\u00f4tel de Ville was for many years the private fiefdom of Jacques Chirac, France's president before Sarkozy, and was the site of a scandal centring on both illegal jobs given to Chirac's party members and an immense entertainment budget. General de Gaulle greeted the crowds from a front window in 1944 when Paris was liberated from the Germans and Robespierre was shot in the jaw and arrested in the original building in 1794. Admirers of H\u00f4tel de Ville's architecture will want to know that Ballu also built the Church of La Trinit\u00e9 in the 9th arrondissement and the belfry of the town hall of the 1st arrondissement, opposite the Louvre's east fa\u00e7ade. Ballu also restored the Tour St Jacques (see below), which was uncovered after restoration work lasting over a decade.   \n7 Tour St Jacques, Rue de Rivoli (M\u00e9tro: Chatelet). A Gothic church tower in a square 150m to the west of the H\u00f4tel de Ville was restored by Ballu, is all that remains of Eglise Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, which was the meeting place in Paris for pilgrims heading to Santiago de Compestela. As such it is included on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.   \n\n8 La Bastille (Metro: Bastille  1  5  8 ). Enter Bastille station through any entrance or on any train and then make your way to the Bobigny/Pablo Picasso-bound platform. All that's left of the fortress whose front steps used to lead up from place de la Bastille are some foundation stones which you can see while waiting for a north bound train on this metro platform. There are maps and explanations showing where the fortress used to be relative the place and surroundings (basically the location of the old front steps are now occupied by Caf\u00e9 des Phares).   \n9 M\u00e9morial de la Shoah (The Holocaust Memorial), 17, rue Geoffroy l\u2019Asnier (Pont Marie  7 ), \u260f +33 1 42 77 44 72. Su-W,F 10:00-18:00; Th 10:00-22:00. Opened in January 2005, the Holocaust Memorial comprises a major documentation centre and a wall bearing 76,000 names of Jews deported from France to the Nazi camps between 1942-1944. Includes an archive of a million artefacts, including 55,000 photographs. Excursions are run from the memorial to French internment camp sites such as Drancy. Admission free.   \n\n\nMuseums and Galleries\n\n10 Centre Georges Pompidou, Place George Pompidou (Metro: Rambuteau  11 ). W-M, 11:00-22:00. Those who are unfamiliar with conceptual art sometimes don't know quite what to expect, or how to approach it. Such travellers should rest assured that the curators at the Pompidou Centre have assembled a marvellous introduction consisting of mostly approachable works which delight, amuse, and entertain. The art is far from the only reason for a visit, as the building also contains a vast public library and a fine restaurant (run by the Costes brothers) on the roof. In fact the place is literally surrounded by some of the nicest pavement caf\u00e9s in the city, in its superb location between the car-free above ground part of Forum Les Halles and the Marais art district. \u20ac8-10.   \n11 Maison de Victor Hugo, 6, Place des Vosges (Metro: Saint-Paul, Chemin Vert, or Bastille, Bus 20, 29, 65, 69, 96), \u260f +33 1 42 72 10 16, fax: +33 1 41 72 06 64. Tu\u2013Su 10:00-18:00. The house in which the famous French novelist Victor Hugo once lived. Free.   \n12 H\u00f4tel de Sully, 62 rue Saint-Antoine (Metro: Saint-Paul or Bastille, Bus 69, 76, 96). Daily 09:00-19:00. Built in 1625, the Hotel de Sully is an interesting house with some sculptures in a beautiful courtyard. The house features special exhibitions, so check listings when in Paris.   \n\n\nDo\nMost of the things to do in the 4th are covered in other sections of this guide, with the main thing to do being to explore.  Of particular interest is the \u00cele Saint Louis (complete with having an ice cream or sorbet from Berthillon), the H\u00f4tels Particuliars, and the Pletzle particularly rue des Rosiers and the area around Place du March\u00e9 Sainte-Catherine.\n\n\nBuy\n\nOver the last decade, the rue des Francs-Bourgeois has become a shopping destination for clothes and accessories. Go during the July or January soldes (sales) and pick up some Anne-Fontaine outfits, Camper shoes, or trendy men's clothing at Melchoir at bargain basement prices.\n\n1 March\u00e9 aux fleurs Reine-Elizabeth-II (Flower Market and Bird Market), Place Louis Lepine (Metro: Cit\u00e9, Saint Michele or Ch\u00e2telet). On the north side of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, the main island at the centre of Paris you'll find a burgeoning daily flower market, where you can buy just about any type of flower, and oddly enough, a range of exotic tropical birds.   \n2 Op\u00e9ra BD, 2 rue des Tournelles (Metro: Bastille), \u260f +33 1 44 54 95 12. Daily 11:00-23:59. Comics (Bandes Dessin\u00e9es) are a serious art form in France and even regular corporate bookstores have a good selection, but it's much better to look for them where they are really appreciated, in one of Paris's many private BD dealers. This one is friendly, well stocked, and keeps late hours so pay them a visit if you would like to pick up a copy of one of the many volumes of Lone Wolf and Cub in French. \n3 Mariage Fr\u00e8res, 30 & 35 rue de Bourg-Tibourg (M\u00e9tro: Hotel de Ville). If you love tea, you'll love this old salon de the in the Marais. \n4 BHV (Bazar de l'H\u00f4tel de Ville), 52 rue de Rivoli (Metro H\u00f4tel de Ville), \u260f +33 1 42 74 90 00. Is a general store with most of everything: clothes, perfumes, furniture, you name it\u2014it's especially famous for its basement section, dedicated to handiwork & DIY --think of it as a small Home Depot in a basement, though with French hardware and house and garden accessories that look distinctive in other settings.   \n\n\nEat\n\nFor dinner or a sit-down lunch there are over a thousand restaurants in the 4th catering to all tastes - many more deserve to be listed than this or any other guide has space for. There are nice places, trendy or traditional throughout the district, but most of the really fancy bistros are clustered around the NW corner of Place de Bastille. You'll really enjoy walking around and checking out the menus, especially during the week when only the most exclusive places require a reservation. That said, here are some ideas:\n\n\nBudget\nIf you are looking for a snack or a quick lunch you could do a lot worse than any one of the kosher falafel stands along the rue des Rosiers near Place des Vosges. If you are on the \u00eele de la Cit\u00e9 though, a closer choice is just to hop across the little pedestrian bridge to the \u00eele Saint-Louis for lunch at any one of the many charming caf\u00e9s.\n\n1 Chez Marianne, 2, Rue des Hospitali\u00e8res-Saint Gervais (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 88 64 15 22. At the corner of rue des Hospitali\u00e8res-Saint Gervais, and the rue Rosiers, Chez Marianne\u2014like the many falafel stands in the Pletzle\u2014serves excellent sandwiches out of a walk up window, but unlike some of the others also has an attractive dining room and a truly lovely terrace where you can enjoy a full range of Jewish/middle-eastern dishes. Falafel out of the window is \u20ac4; in the dining room you'll pay around \u20ac15 for a vegetarian menu, or up to \u20ac22 for the most expensive dishes \u00e0 la carte.. \n2 La Perla, 26 rue Fran\u00e7ois Miron (Metro: H\u00f4tel de Ville), \u260f +33 1 42 77 59 40. Daily 11:00-14:00. Good Mexican food to be had within a stone's throw of the Ile de St. Louis. They mix a decent margarita too! You'll pay about \u20ac10 for a plate ordered \u00e0 la carte. \n Flunch, 21 Rue de Beaubourg (Metro Rambuteau), \u260f +33 1 40290978, 1172d@flunch.fr. 08:00-22:00. Self-service restaurant, right next to the Pompidou centre. Steaks etc. are cooked fresh when ordered, other food is pre-cooked and there is a microwave in the table area should you need to heat anything up. A chance to try authentic French food at cheap prices. Just one minus - there is a free water and ice dispender next to the microwave, in the table area, AFTER you've paid and probably bought another drink! Price - e.g. one couscous, one steak with mixed vegetables, two pieces of bread, \u20ac16.50. Around \u20ac8 per person. (updated Jul 2016)\n\n\nMid-range\n3 O Corcovado Marais, 7, rue Simon-Lefranc (Metro: Rambuteau), \u260f +33 6 60 40 08 58, info@ocorcovado.com. Tu-Su 19:00-.

In summertime one can sit nicely outdoor. \u20ac10. \n5 Le Loir dans la Th\u00e9i\u00e8re, 3, rue des Rosiers (Metro: Saint Paul), \u260f +33 1 42 72 90 61. 09:00-19:30. A highly recommended and quaint little tea shop, well worth a visit especially for brunch, which at \u20ac15.50 is a great value for the quantity, quality, and ambience. The cakes are huge, but if one is too late they might already be gone. \n6 Pain Vin Fromages, 3, rue Geoffrey l'Angevin (M\u00e9tro Rambuteau), \u260f +33 1 42 74 07 52. It's all about cheese, with a selection of Swiss dishes, and others. \n7 Le Colima\u00e7on, 44 Rue Vieille du Temple (M\u00e9tro H\u00f4tel de Ville), \u260f +33 1 48 87 12 01. 6:30PM - 10:45PM; Sunday Brunch from 12:30PM - 2:30PM.

In the aristocratic d\u00e9cors of the 18th century the chef Bernard Pacaud and his son prepare modern and refined food. The \"tarte au chocolat\" is surreal. \u20ac500.   (updated Mar 2020)\n9 Brasserie Bofinger, 3, rue de la Bastille (Metro: Bastille), \u260f +33 1 42 72 87 82. A beautiful, historical d\u00e9cor in the Art Nouveau style (see the ceiling upstairs); good Alsatian cuisine : choucroute, kuglopf, etc, plus good classic cuisine de brasserie. \n10 Le Georges, 19 rue Beaubourg, \u260f +33 1 44 78 47 99. On the top floor of the Centre Georges Pompidou, the restaurant Georges offers a panoramic view of Paris. Serves modern French food with classic desserts like \"blancs en neige\". M 11:00-24:00, W-Su 11:00-02:00. \n\n\nIce cream\nFrench ice cream is famous for its sorbet and there are excellent ice cream parlours to choose from:\n\n11 Amorino, 47, rue Saint Louis en l\u2019Ile, \u260f +33 1 42 78 07 75, marais@amorino.fr.

W-Su 10:00-20:00. The most renowned French sorbet has his little tea shop since 1954. The wait in the queue is definitely worth it, also with some luck the queue isn't that big. On the corner, the queue for takeaway is usually bigger but, of course, faster. Taking the ice to the Seine is, of course. a possible option. \n13 Pozetto, 39 Rue du Roi de Sicile (M\u00e9tro: Hotel de Ville), \u260f +33 1 42 77 08 64. M-Th 12:15\u201323:45, F Sa 12:15-00:45, Su 12:15\u201323:45. Little shop that's both a caf\u00e9 and sells Italian ice cream. The ice cream flavours vary according to the season. \n\n\nDrink\nIn the 4th it's really hard to say whether a given place is somewhere to Eat or somewhere to Drink. Most of the places on this list serve dinner, and some serve lunch as well.\n\n The Auld Alliance Scottish Pub, 80, rue Francois Miron (Metro St Paul), \u260f +33 1 48 04 30 40. Daily, last orders 01:30. Friendly staff and customers help create a welcoming atmosphere at the original Scottish pub in Paris. Excellent food is served every day including a hearty brunch.

Since 1992 this otherwise very attractive but fairly standard Parisian caf\u00e9 has been host to a lively discussion of contemporary philosophy and attendant issues every Sunday night. There's a political discussion too, on the first Thursday of each month. \n Caf\u00e9 Lut\u00e8ce, 33, quai de Bourbon (Metro: Pont-Marie). This little bistro would be totally unremarkable if it weren't for the location, on the north bank of Ile Saint-Louis, where you can watch the colours of the sunset light play over the towers of the H\u00f4tel de Ville as you enjoy a glass or three of beer or house wine, or maybe a cognac. \n Le Lizard Lounge, 18, rue du Bourg-Tibourg (Metro: H\u00f4tel-de-Ville), \u260f +33 1 42 72 48 34. \n Le Petit Fer A Cheval, 30, rue Vieille-du Temple (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 42 72 47 47. \n La Chaise au Plafond, 10, rue du Tr\u00e9sor (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 42 76 03 22. The Chaise is one of those truly warm and welcoming caf\u00e9s. The proprietor usually makes an effort to spend at least a couple of minutes at each table, and somehow manages to remember visitors even years later. \n Les Etages, 35, rue Vieille du Temple (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 42 78 72 00. \n Stolly's, 7, rue Cloche-Perce (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 42 76 06 76. \n1 Caf\u00e9oth\u00e8que de Paris, 52, rue de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville (Metro: Pont Marie), \u260f +33 1 52 01 83 84. Daily 09:30-19:30. Coffee in Paris is usually found to be lacking, but not in this mini temple to coffee. A gem tucked into a backstreet by the river in le Marais roasts their own beans from around the world and has a small laid-back caf\u00e9 area with armchairs. Staff are passionate about great coffee, not just a scaldingly hot coffee! They have some cakes and wine, and speak Spanish and English. \n Dome Du Marais, 53 bis, rue De Francs Bourgeois, \u260f +33 1 42 74 54 17. \n Wake Up Paris, 31, boul Henri IV (Metro: Bastille). A wonderful little bar with a Brazilian tilt that serves excellent caipirinhas. The staff is friendly and eager to strike up a conversation, especially about cacha\u00e7a, the Brazilian liqueur that forms the base of their signature drink. It's a wonderful spot for catching a football match as well. \n2 Queen Ann, 5 rue Simon le Franc (M\u00e9tro: Rambuteau), \u260f +33 1 42 78 00 07. Tu-Su 12:00-19:00.

Even still you should book ahead if possible as there is also tons of demand.\n\n\nBudget\n MIJE, 6, rue de Fourcy, 12 rue des Barres, and 11 rue du Fauconnier (Metro: St. Paul), \u260f +33 1 42 74 23 45. Consistently given the highest possible ratings this organization actually runs three hostels in the Marais. The only possible drawback is that they have an afternoon lockout for cleaning. The MIJE Maubuisson on rue des Barres gets the nod of the three for being in an historic Tudor-style building. Dorm-room beds start at \u20ac32 at all three places. Single rooms are \u20ac52. \n H\u00f4tel Rivoli, 44, rue Rivoli (Metro: Hotel de Ville), \u260f +33 1 42 72 08 41. In the heart of the city with cheap doubles.

A good value for the price and location. \u20ac45, or \u20ac60 with a shower. \n Grand H\u00f4tel Jeanne-d'Arc, 3, rue de Jarente (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 48 87 62 11. In the calmer part of the Marais, not far from Place de Bastille and Place des Vosges, this little hotel fills up well in advance, so you'll need to book ahead. \u20ac57 for a basic room. \n\n\nMid-range\n H\u00f4tel du Septi\u00e8me Art, 20 rue Saint-Paul (Metro: Saint-Paul), \u260f +33 1 44 54 85 00, fax: +33 1 42 77 69 10. A little place done up in all black and white in homage to the cinema, the 7th Art offers a good value on comfortable rooms, and polite, quality service. Single rooms include air conditioning, WC, and shower. A 5-min promenade to the Rue de Rivoli. \u20ac75+. \n   H\u00f4tel Hospitel, 1, Place du Parvis Notre Dame-Galerie B2, 6F (Metro: Cit\u00e9), \u260f +33 1 44 32 01 00. You can't beat the location of this no-star but mid-range offering on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 located on the 6th floor of the Hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu a functioning hospital which is also classified as an official historical monument. H\u00f4spitel offers quite a bit of service and comfort.

This lovely little three-star is at the far end of the 4th bumped right up against Place de Bastille. The place is inviting and the rooms are quite comfy and air conditioned. The location is good especially if you are interested in fine dining, as the place is surrounded by some of the better bistros on the right bank. \u20ac95 for a single. \n Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais, 12, rue Vieille-du-Temple (Metro: Saint-Paul or H\u00f4tel-de-Ville), \u260f +33 1 42 72 34 12. These are of the expected (small) size for Paris though elegantly appointed in 18th-century style. Equipment includes air conditioning. Tea and coffee at the reception. The courtyard is a two-by-two metre light shaft, so rooms facing it have no view, and are quite dark on the ground and first floors. A simple request to avoid them on booking will suffice. The staff speak English well. Single for \u20ac137. \n H\u00f4tel de Lutece, 65, rue Saint-Louis-en-l'Ile (Metro: Pont-Marie), \u260f +33 1 43 26 23 52. \u20ac158. \n Hotel Notre Dame, 19, rue Ma\u00eetre Alberte, \u260f +33 9 77 19 84 17.
