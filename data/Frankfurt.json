  "extract": "Frankfurt (German: Frankfurt am Main) is the largest city in the German state of Hesse, and is considered the business and financial centre of Germany. It is the fifth largest city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne. The city is known for its modern skyline, and for hosting the headquarters of the European Central Bank, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse stock exchange and numerous German financial services companies. Furthermore, it hosts some of the world's most important trade shows, such as the Frankfurt Auto Show and the Frankfurt Book Fair. It is on the river Main at a crossroad of the German Autobahn system and connected to several  high-speed rail lines, with Germany's busiest airport on its outskirts, Frankfurt is one of the most important transportation hubs of Europe.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nFrankfurt is a city of contrasts. Wealthy bankers, students and hippie drop-outs coexist in a city that has some of the highest, most avant-garde skyscrapers of Europe next to well maintained old buildings. The downtown area, especially R\u00f6mer square and the museums at the River Main, draw millions of tourists every year. On the other hand, many off-the-beaten-track neighbourhoods, such as Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and Sachsenhausen, with their intact beautiful 19th-century streets and parks are often overlooked by visitors.\nIt's the heart of the Rhine-Main region, spanning from Mainz and Wiesbaden in the west to Hanau in the east and Gie\u00dfen in the north to Darmstadt in the south and has some 5.6 million inhabitants (2019) in the whole surrounding metropolitan area.\nFrankfurt is the place where Germany's major autobahns and railways intersect. About 650,000 people commute to the city each day, not counting some 763,000 people who live here (2019). With a huge airport \u2014 the third-largest in Europe \u2014 it is the gateway to Germany and for many people also the first point of arrival in Europe. Further, it is a prime hub for interconnections within Europe and for intercontinental flights.\nIn the years following 1968, especially in the late 1970s and up to the early 1980s, Frankfurt was a centre of the left wing Sponti-Szene, which frequently clashed with police and local authorities over politics and urban design issues (specifically whether or not old buildings should be torn down). Several members of these radical groups went on to have quite respectable careers in politics, among them Daniel Cohn-Bendit (long time leading MEP for the Greens) and Joschka Fischer (Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor 1998-2005), though their erstwhile radical and violent antics did hurt them in their later political careers.\nFrankfurt has one of the highest percentage of immigrants in Germany: about 25% of Frankfurt's people have no German passport and another 10% are naturalized German citizens. With about 35% immigrants, Frankfurt is one of the most diverse of German cities.\nFrankfurt is home to many museums, theatres and a world-class opera.\n\n\nTerritorial subdivisions\nFrankfurt is divided into 16 Ortsbezirke, which are further subdivided into 46 Stadtteile. As Frankfurt is an expansive city with a large area given its population, most of those are of little interest to a tourist, with most attractions concentrated in the Ortsbezirk Innenstadt I (there are four Ortsbezirke starting with Innenstadt (\"inner city\"), distinguished by Roman numerals). Some Stadtteile of particular note are:\n\nAltstadt (Dom-R\u00f6mer Quarter) \u2013 the heart of Frankfurt's old town, largely rebuilt after the Second World War, particularly, as part of a major urban development project, from 2012 to 2018\nInnenstadt \u2013 named confusingly (sharing its name with the larger Ortsbezirk) is the part embracing the Altstadt up until the old city fortifications, still visible as a green belt on the city map. The home to the most of Frankfurt's skyscrapers\nBahnhofsviertel \u2013 the densely-built part of the city immediately facing the Hauptbahnhof, hosting the most hotels in town and its red light district\nGutleutviertel \u2013 the area south of the tracks leading up to the Hauptbahnhof, with a modern residential quarter on the Main\nGallus \u2013 the area north of the Hauptbahnhof tracks known most for the past-2010 Europaviertel development (a new city quarter with apartment blocks and offices built around the wide Europaallee next to the fairgrounds)\nBockenheim\nWestend \u2013 the most expensive part of Frankfurt by land values, mostly covered with low-rise residential buildings and villas, but also several skyscrapers on its edges\nNordend\nBornheim \u2013 Popular area with small shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants, as well as historic taverns and half-timbered houses. See listing below.\nSachsenhausen \u2013 the historic southern bank of the river Main, which preserved its typical 19th-century character, very different from the modern northern bank punctured by skyscrapers. Includes the Museumsufer museum collection directly at the riverbank. See listing below for further details.\nH\u00f6chst \u2013 Formerly a separate small town, now a suburb. The small Altstadt, around the Schloss, is one of the closest places to central Frankfurt that you can see large numbers of traditional timber-framed buildings that didn't get destroyed in the war. The square by the Schloss has some very nice traditional Gastst\u00e4tte to eat or drink in. See listing below for further details.\n\n\nWhen to visit\nThe best times for Frankfurt are late spring to early autumn. The summers tend to be sunny and warm around 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Be prepared, however, for very hot summer days around 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) as well as for light rain. The winters can be cold and rainy (usually not lower than -10\u00b0C/14\u00b0F). It rarely snows in Frankfurt itself.\nIf you intend to stay overnight, you may wish to avoid times when trade fairs are held, as this will make finding affordable accommodation a challenging task. The biggest is the Book Fair (Buchmesse) yearly in mid-October; see Fairs for details.\n\n\nTourist information\n\nThere are two offices for tourism information:\n\n1 Touristinfo Hauptbahnhof (near the main exit, next to the DB service area, look for the signs), \u260f +49 69 2123-8800, fax: +49 69 2123-7880, info@infofrankfurt.de. M-F 08:00-21:00, Sa Su Holidays 09:00-18:00; New Year + New Year's Eve 08:00-13:00; closed  25-26 Dec. \n2 Touristinfo R\u00f6mer, R\u00f6merberg 27 (Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 ), \u260f +49 69 2123-8800, fax: +49 69 21 23 78 80, info@infofrankfurt.de. M-F 09:30\u201317:30, Sa Su holidays 10:00-16:00 New Year + New Year's Eve 10:00-13:00; closed 25-26 Dec. \n\n\nGet in\nFrankfurt is the heart of central Germany and as such, it is one of the most important transportation hubs. It has excellent connections by rail, road and air. Reaching and leaving Frankfurt is easy.\n\n\nBy plane\n\n\nFrankfurt Airport\nMain article: Frankfurt Airport\n1 Frankfurt Airport (FRA IATA) is among the busiest in Europe \u2014 fourth in passenger traffic after London Heathrow, Amsterdam Schiphol and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport. Frankfurt is the banking centre of Germany and hosts numerous international trade fairs. Therefore all major airlines and all airline alliances fly frequently to Frankfurt and connect it to every inhabited continent and all major cities in the world. The German flag carrier Lufthansa is the main airline in Frankfurt and offers most connections. Lufthansa also has several domestic feeder flights to and from Frankfurt that also serve business travelers.\n\nThe airport is connected to downtown Frankfurt by taxi, bus (line 61 to Frankfurt S\u00fcd(bahnhof)  U1  U2  U3  U8  S5  S6  (Frankfurt South Station), and most easily by  S-Bahn (fast commuter trains).\nTo get to the city by S-Bahn, take lines  S8  or  S9  in the direction of Offenbach Ost or Hanau at the regional train station, 2 Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Regionalbahnhof, on the lowest level of Terminal 1 (entrances in section A and B). If your plane lands or departs from Terminal 2, count in another 15 minutes as you need to move between the terminals with either the shuttle bus or the monorail Skytrain (both are free of charge, just follow the signs). If you want to go downtown, get off at Frankfurt Taunusanlage , Frankfurt Hauptwache  or Frankfurt Konstablerwache , which are in the heart of the city. If you want to change to long-distance trains get off at Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof  (Frankfurt Central Station). The ride from the airport to the central station takes about 20 minutes. You have to purchase a ticket at the vending machines in the train station before boarding the train. The adult ticket costs \u20ac5.80, and \u20ac3.40 for children (April 2023).\nIf you want to go to the airport by S-Bahn, take the  S8  or  S9  in the direction of Wiesbaden. Don't take the  S1 , since it does not stop at the airport.\n\nRegional trains RB and RE to Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Hanau stop at the same place as the S-Bahn to Frankfurt.\nConnections outside the Frankfurt region have a separate long-distance train station, 3 Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Fernbahnhof. Here, you can board high-speed long-distance trains (Inter-City and ICE) to Cologne, Munich and other national and international destinations. Local train tickets are not valid on ICE or IC.\n\n\nHahn Airport\nThe smaller airport called Frankfurt/Hahn (HHN IATA), mostly used by budget airlines, advertises proximity to Frankfurt. However, Hahn is far away from Frankfurt and it takes about 90 minutes to drive there from downtown to cover the 125 km (78 mi) distance. For that airport, if you have to use it at all, allow more time in your travel plans and budget. A  bus from Frankfurt/Hahn to Frankfurt Main airport and on to Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (Frankfurt Central Station) costs about \u20ac17.99 and leaves roughly every hour. Tickets are available from the kiosk outside in front of the main entrance.\nFrankfurt/Hahn is not far (9 km) from Traben-Trarbach, which lies by the Mosel river and has a train station. The streets between the airport and Traben-Trarbach are not lit at night and have no sidewalk.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in Germany\n\nFrankfurt has three major train stations: 4 Hauptbahnhof (main station), 5 S\u00fcdbahnhof (south station) and the above-mentioned one at the airport (Flughafen Fernbahnhof). However, several inter-city trains that stop at the airport do not stop at Hauptbahnhof. Long-distance trains leaving from Hauptbahnhof do not stop at S\u00fcdbahnhof, while a few long-distance trains pass by Hauptbahnhof and only stop at S\u00fcdbahnhof. Check the timetable to make sure you are going to the right station!\nFrankfurt Hauptbahnhof is one of the biggest and busiest train stations in Europe, so it's definitely worth a visit. Frankfurt has connections to most German cities - and neighbouring countries especially to the south and west - via InterCity and high-speed InterCity Express trains. There is no problem to get a connection to any train destination from Frankfurt.\nFrankfurt train stations are very large, confusing, labyrinth-like places for newcomers.  Allow extra time to locate the boarding area for your train.  Don't hesitate to ask someone for help the first time. There is a large departures signboard above the main exit/entrance with destination and platform information, and you can also get information from the railway travel office in the station.\nFrom the main ticket office at Frankfurt you can buy 5- and 10-day rail travel cards which allow you to travel around Germany using all train services, including the Intercity ones. These are a significant saving on individual train fares. The 5-day ticket costs \u20ac189 and the 10-day ticket \u20ac289. You cannot buy these tickets from regional train stations.\nIn addition to regular Deutsche Bahn trains and regional trains on which DB tickets are valid, Frankfurt is also served by Flixtrain. Tickets can be bought through Flixbus, but DB tickets are not valid and there is no BahnCard discount. That said, Flixtrain tickets are usually considerably cheaper than comparable DB tickets.\n\n\nBy car\nSee also: Driving in Germany\nFrankfurt is connected to several autobahns and can be easily reached by car. Try to avoid rush-hour and especially snowy days, as car traffic can easily break down. Parking is definitely a problem in most areas. Especially during big conventions\u2014such the Internationale Automobilausstellung (International Automobile Exhibition) in September, or the Frankfurter Buchmesse (Frankfurt Book Fair) in mid-October\u2014you should consider using the well designed park-and-ride system If you intend to stay mostly in Frankfurt and only make day-trips to the bigger cities in the surrounding area, consider leaving the car altogether and arriving by train, as Frankfurt has a superb public transport system (see below).\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: Intercity buses in Germany\n6 Fernbusbahnhof Frankfurt am Main. This new bus station opened in 2019 to cope with rising demand for intercity buses in the 2010s  (updated Apr 2019)\n\n\nGet around\n\n  \n\n\nBy public transport\n\nFrankfurt has a good, co-ordinated public transport system of Underground (U-Bahn), tram (Stra\u00dfenbahn) and bus. Public transit nerds will be quick to point out, that the \"U-Bahn\" is actually a bit of a misnomer, given the fact that it has moved traffic sections in the outskirts, more in line with systems called \"Stadtbahn\" in other German cities. The RMV site has basic information and timetable information available in English and other languages. The U-Bahn (metro) stations are signed with a white capital \"U\" on a blue background . For connections to the suburbs or airport, use the S-Bahn, signed with a white \"S\" on green background . Almost all S-Bahn lines and two U-Bahn lines ( U6 ,  U7 ) come together in the city-tunnel in central Frankfurt (7 Hauptwache  U1  U2  U3  U6  U7  U8  and 8 Konstablerwache  U4  U5  U6  U7 ), besides line  S7 , which ends at Central Station. If you want to go to the old city take the U-Bahn to 9 Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5  or tram line 11 or 12.\nThe S-Bahn, run by Deutsche Bahn, connects the downtown areas to outer-lying suburbs as well as other cities in the region, such as Mainz, Wiesbaden, and Darmstadt. Beware that the S-Bahn is notorious for its delays. If you need to get somewhere on time, allow for some buffer time. In the morning rush-hour, delays of 5\u201315 minutes are common. If you are catching a plane or have another similar time-critical appointment, allow an extra 30 minutes to be on the safe side. Other services (subway, tram and bus) are usually more punctual.\n\n\nTickets\nYou can get single trip, all-day and weekly tickets. You can get tickets for one person or a group of up to five people travelling together.\nYou must use a ticket machine to purchase a ticket before boarding. Ticket machines can be switched to English.  You have to press Einzelfahrt Frankfurt for a single trip in the city and Tageskarte Frankfurt for a day ticket in the city. If you want to ride to the airport, you have to press Einzelfahrt Frankfurt Flughafen or Tageskarte Frankfurt Flughafen. If your destination is outside Frankfurt, you have to look up your destination on the list provided at the machine, enter this number with the numeric keypad, then press the button for the type of ticket you want (Einzelfahrt - single trip; Tageskarte - day ticket). Also, every station has some stations listed as \"short distance\" destinations (Kurzstrecke); tickets to those are cheaper.  If you have the opportunity, ask a bystander to explain the vending machines to you the first time you want to buy a ticket. Unlike in other German cities, tickets purchased are valid immediately. You cannot purchase single trip tickets in advance, but time tickets (day, week, month) can be chosen according to the date, which you have to know in advance.\nFares are based on the zones you travel through. Central Frankfurt is all contained within a single zone (zone 50) so tickets (except short trip tickets) are all the one fare. In this central zone a single trip ticket costs \u20ac3.40 and a day ticket costs \u20ac7.20. For the central zone and the airport zone together a single trip ticket costs \u20ac5.80 and a day ticket costs \u20ac11.30. Group day-tickets (5 people: \u20ac11.30 / \u20ac19.10) cost less than two individual day-tickets, so are better value if you are travelling together and purchasing day-tickets. Discounts are available for children of age 14 and under.\nIf you are visiting attractions and museums then consider buying a Frankfurt Card. It allows unlimited travel on Frankfurt's public transport system (city zone and airport) and discounts in many museums. The Frankfurt Card is available as a one day and two day ticket, and for a single person or a group of up to five (1 person 1 day \u20ac11.50, 2 days \u20ac17.00; group (max. 5 persons) 1 day \u20ac24, 2 days \u20ac34) [updated 2023]. These tickets are not sold at the vending machines. You can buy the Frankfurt Card at the airport (arrival gate B, terminal 1), at travel agencies, railway stations, at the tourist information desk at Hauptbahnhof, at the tourist information desk at R\u00f6mer, or in advance online. A one-day one-person Frankfurt card including airport transportation is cheaper than the equivalent public transport ticket that includes the airport.\nA fine of \u20ac60 applies for riding without a valid ticket.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nUber, Bolt and Free Now cover the city.\n\n\nBy taxi\nFrankfurt has plenty of taxi drivers to service the many business travellers. The city is not too big, although fares tend to be expensive. Watch out for taxi drivers that take detours if they notice that you do not know the city. Still, for door-to-door transport, taxis are a way to go.\nMost taxi drivers love to drive to the airport because it's longer than inner-city fares, but not all taxi drivers are licensed to go there. They tend to drive very fast because most German business travellers expect them to do this. If you feel uncomfortable, let the driver know and he will slow down.\nIn the main tourist areas downtown there are also human-powered bike taxis that convey one or two passengers. For those not too keen on walking this may be a convenient way of seeing the sights.\n\n\nBy car\nAvoid using your car in the city, especially in tourist \"hot spots\" like Sachsenhausen (especially on a Saturday) because of congestion and a severe lack of parking spaces. It's very limited, and people tend to park in places they're not supposed to. This ends up costing a fair bit if your car gets towed, which it often will. If you want to enter the city, your best bet is to use a Parkhaus (parking garage, which charges a fee of \u20ac1 per hour or \u20ac8 for the whole day) and then either walk, or take public transport.\nMany areas are reserved for local residents, in and outside the city. You will see the areas marked by parking signs that indicate a local permit is needed during certain hours during the day. The wording to be aware of is \"Parkausweis Nr.X\" (where X is a number). If you park in these spaces you risk a fine.\nEven vehicles registered in countries other than Germany need a \"low emissions\" sticker (on the inside of the windscreen) to legally enter certain signposted environmental protection zones in Frankfurt. (The stickers are valid for all low emission zones in Germany.) Labelling a vehicle with these emission stickers, also often called \"fine particle stickers\", is voluntary, but vehicles without this sticker - even those with foreign number plates and even those that would otherwise meet the criteria - are not allowed into environmental zones without risking a fine of \u20ac40.\nAlso, remember that Germany has strict laws about driving under the influence of alcohol, only allowing 0.5mg of alcohol per mL of blood. That's just about one beer or glass of wine. Although there are Autobahns without speed limits, when there are speed limits, these are enforced rigorously. Radar traps are frequent. Heavy on-the-spot fines can be levied. The laws pertaining to tailgating have been sharpened, and the fines have gotten larger.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nFrankfurt is bike-friendly, featuring an expansive network of bike lanes. While there are various rental-bike companies in Frankfurt, they are relatively rare and situated in inconvenient areas of the city for travellers. A more convenient source of rental bikes may be Deutsche Bahn. Look out for their rental bikes, marked in the colours red and white and the letters \"DB\".\n\nThese bikes are available year-round and can be found pretty much anywhere in the city - especially at street corners, which are the major pick-up and drop-off points. You can rent these bikes 24/7 just using your cell-phone and your credit card. German citizens can also sign-up for direct debit from their checking account. For instructions on how to use this service, call the number on the bike or go their website.\nAnother service is offered by nextbike. Sign up (either online or via their hotline) and rent bicycles and return them at any station all over town. Rates are charged by the half-hour (\u20ac1) and are capped at \u20ac9 per day.\n\n Call-a-bike service. \n nextbike. \n GoetheRad, Landwehrweg 1 (at the Goethe Tower in Sachsenhausen, top of the Hill), \u260f +49 1765 052 8599.

The imposing town hall and the cathedral St Bartholomeus where emperors of the Holy Roman empire were crowned in the 17th and 18th centuries are among them. Walk on top of a tower or get to the Main for good views of the skyline.\n\n\nHistorical attractions\n\n1 R\u00f6merberg (within city centre just north of Eiserner Steg bridge, subway Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 ). R\u00f6merberg is the historic centre of Frankfurt, with a number of beautiful buildings, including the town hall and a church from the 14th and 15th century. The name R\u00f6mer itself refers to the town hall of Frankfurt, which itself received this name from the prominent main building 2 Haus zum R\u00f6mer, which has existed since at least 1322 and was bought by the city administration in 1405. Fortunately, large parts of the R\u00f6mer's fa\u00e7ade survived World War II. The 3 Fountain of Justice marks the centre of the R\u00f6merberg, while the 4 Alte Nikolaikirche  (a 12th-century church, current form since the 15th century) is on its southern side. The square is replete with beautiful half-timbered houses, many of which were destroyed during World War II, and completely rebuilt afterwards. One exception is the 5 Haus Wertheim (also known as Haus Wertheym), which was first mentioned in 1383 and for which the current building dates from around 1600, presumably making it Frankfurt's oldest historic restaurant. Walking towards the Main river, you can further see the 6 Wharfinger's Tower (Rententurm), a 15th-century fortified tower in late Gothic style, which is connected to the 7 Saalhof, a 12th-century castle building that was later modernized but never completely destroyed. Numerous caf\u00e9s and shops can be found at the square itself and in the vicinity. Behind and north of the Haus zum R\u00f6mer, the town hall was extended in 1900\u20131908 with the construction of the Neues Rathaus building complex, a series of Gothic/Renaissance style buildings. This includes a tower known as 8 Langer Franz and the 9 Seufzerbr\u00fccke, a bridge connecting two buildings within the complex, both best viewed at Bethmannstra\u00dfe/Paulsplatz.   \n10 Dom-R\u00f6mer-Areal (New Old City Frankfurt) (just east of the R\u00f6merberg, subway to Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 ). Urban revitalization of the Dom-R\u00f6mer complex, in which a number of old historic buildings have been rebuilt from scratch \u2013 incorporating only a few original artifacts \u2013 based on old pictures and drawings. The area includes the Steinerne Haus at Markt 44, a medieval-looking building first erected in 1464 that had already been rebuilt in the 1960s. The street known as Alter Markt or simply as Markt was in fact one of the most important ones in the old town. Upon being crowned in the cathedral, the new emperors of the Holy Roman Empire would take this path to proceed to the R\u00f6merberg and R\u00f6mer, where the ceremonial procedures continued. This area also includes the remains of an ancient Roman settlement that used to be known as the Arch\u00e4ologische Garten, but reopened indoors as part of the new Dom-R\u00f6mer-Areal revitalization project. The completed area was officially inaugurated in September 2018.   \n11 Kaiserdom (Frankfurt Cathedral/Imperial Cathedral of Saint Bartholomew) (Located right next to the R\u00f6merberg, subway to Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 , Tram 11/12 \u201eR\u00f6mer/Paulskirche\u201c). The main cathedral with its 95 m high tower, built in Gothic style in the 14th century. From 1562 to 1792, emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were crowned in the cathedral. It is possible to ascend the tower to a platform at 66 m height, affording excellent views over the city. For this, you will need to enter via a separate entrance at the southern side of the cathedral and climb over 300 steps in a narrow winding staircase.  \n12 Eiserner Steg (Iron bridge) (Subway to Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 ). Relatively well-known bridge for pedestrians, built in 1869. It is just a minute away from the R\u00f6mer. Crossing the bridge leads you to Sachsenhausen and provides good views of the skyline.   \n\n13 Paulskirche (St. Paul's Church), Paulsplatz 11 (Located just north of the R\u00f6mer place, subway to Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 ). A church with important political symbolism in Germany. This was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in Germany in 1848. Here the revolutionaries wrote the 1848 constitution that sadly was never put into effect. Like most historic buildings in the city centre, it was destroyed during World War II, but was also among the first buildings to be rebuilt after 1945 (with different interior). Today the building is used as a memorial site and an event centre, including hosting the awarding of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. Free.   \n14 Liebfrauenkirche, Liebfrauengasse/Neue Kr\u00e4me (near the Zeil). 14th century Roman Catholic church and monastery.   \n15 Hauptwache (public transport to Hauptwache  U1  U2  U3  U6  U7  U8 ). A public area that is often considered the central hub of Frankfurt's modern downtown area due to its importance as a public transportation station and its central location, right between the main shopping street (Zeil) and the Rossmarkt (another public square), and just south of the 15th-century Eschenheimer Turm (Eschenheim Tower). The place is named after a Baroque building (\"Hauptwache\") more or less in its centre. The building was constructed in 1730 to house the local city militia, as Frankfurt was an independent city at the time. When Frankfurt became part of Prussia, the building gradually lost its original function. Since 1905, it has instead been serving as a caf\u00e9 (\"Caf\u00e9 Hauptwache\"). Other attractions include the Katharinenkirche, and the Palais Thurn-und-Taxis.   \n\n16 Alte Oper (Old Opera), Opernplatz 1 (subway to Alte Oper  U6  U7  or Hauptwache  U1  U2  U3  U6  U7  U8  \u2013 and walk a few minutes), \u260f +49 69 134 0400 (for tickets). Renaissance Opera Building in the centre of the city. A busy square with fountains can be found in front of it. It was opened in 1880, but it has not been used for operas since the rebuilding after the war, but for concerts, congresses, and similar \"fancy\" events.   \n17 B\u00f6rse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), B\u00f6rsenplatz 4, \u260f +49 69 21111515. M-F 09:00-17:00, Sa Su closed. The Frankfurt stock exchange building, still in use, see the bull and bear statues just outside. You cannot enter the building unless you have registered for a guided tour at least one working day in advance. Free.   (updated Oct 2017)\n 18 Sachsenhausen (tram to Affentorplatz). By crossing one of the bridges from the city centre you reach the Sachsenhausen part of the city south of the Main river. The old town part, 19 Alt-Sachsenhausen, especially in Kleine Ritterstra\u00dfe and Gro\u00dfe Ritterstra\u00dfe (two streets near Affentorplatz), is famous for its old cider bars (see the \"Drink\" section for more information) and traditional half-timbered houses, many of which survived World War 2 (unlike much of the city centre). The 20 Dreik\u00f6nigskirche  (Church of the Three Kings) at Dreik\u00f6nigsstra\u00dfe 30 was built in 1880, replacing an older 14th century chapel. The Catholic 21 Deutschordenskirche  (Church of the Teutonic Order) dates to the Middle Ages but suffered substantial damage during World War 2 and needed to be restored after the war. You can also walk along the river bank or visit the Schweizer Stra\u00dfe (see the \"Buy\" section).   (updated Aug 2018)\n\n\nSkyline\n\nFrankfurt has some of the tallest buildings in Germany (the Commerzbank Tower is the country's tallest office building). Its skyline is unique for the country, as the high rises are concentrated in a relatively small downtown area, giving Frankfurt the looks of a metropolis. One of the reasons for this are the lax zoning laws compared to the rest of Germany. Elsewhere, building such high rise buildings is almost - if not outright - impossible. The skyline is the reason why Frankfurt is sometimes called by the nickname Mainhattan.\n\nFor a view of the skyline try the Main river bridges. The eastern bridges offer the best view, in particular the Ignaz-Bubis-Br\u00fccke and also the Alte Br\u00fccke. For a great view including the new European Central Bank building, the train bridge in Ostend and the new bridge behind it provide excellent views.

The Messe Frankfurt is one of the world's largest exhibition centres, hosting a continuous stream of exhibitions small, large and gargantuan \u2014 the Motor Show draws almost a million visitors. Most fairs are open to the public for at least part of the time, and can be a fascinating if somewhat overwhelming experience if you're interested in the theme. The Messe has its own S-Bahn train station, Messe  S3  S4  S5  S6 , two stops away from the Central Railway Station (from platform 104, underground), and there's also the Festhalle/Messe  U4  subway stop.

The last two days (Sa Su) are open to the general public, with book sales allowed on Sunday only. The public days of the Book Fair have also drawn a vast contingent of manga/anime fans, many of whom dress up as their favourite characters! Photography is allowed, but only after asking permission.

A lot of people will spend a sunny afternoon walking or sitting there on a lawn or playing frisbee or football. It's a relatively quiet area, considering it's in the heart of the city. Nearby cafes and restaurants allow you to have a drink in between. The only disadvantage is that it can be quite crowded when the weather is nice; try going during business hours on a weekday unless you're looking for a crowd.\nGo for a walk in the City Forest (Stadtwald) in the south of Frankfurt. With about 48 km\u00b2, it is regarded as the largest inner-city forest in Germany. Six playgrounds and nine ponds make the forest a popular tourist attraction. The forest can be reached via tram line 17 direction Neu-Isenburg/Stadtgrenze from Frankfurt Main Station (Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof  S1  S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  U4  U5 ).

Various special events are organized; for example dances, music performances, special exhibits, games, and so on. It is very crowded but also highly recommended; be prepared for very long lines. Buy a ticket in advance so you do not have to waste time during the night of the event on this, and do not forget to pick up a schedule of the events and map of the bus routes. Similar events are organized in other German cities as well. (date needs fixing)\n Christmas Market (Frankfurt Weihnachtsmarkt): , R\u00f6merberg, Paulsplatz und Mainkai (Dom/R\u00f6mer  U4  U5 ).

Fireworks on the last day. Free. (date needs fixing)\nThere are various fireworks displays throughout the year. Many major events - like the Museumsufer festival are ended with very well done fireworks. Check your local event schedule; if you are in the city these are always worth your time. The exception are the New Year fireworks, which are unorganized and less than spectacular. Good vantage points are the Main bridges, or the river banks.\n\n\nOther activities\nThe RMV offers a tour of the city in the so-called Ebbelwei Express, a special tram that offers music, apple wine, and pretzels. Probably very stereotypical and more suited for people who do not mind \"tacky\" tourist traps.\nAbout once a month, an old steam engine train rides along tracks on the northern riverbank of the Main. Prices vary, starting at \u20ac4 for an adult.\n12 Kobelt-Zoo, Schwanheimer Bahnstra\u00dfe, \u260f +49 69 35353047, kobelt-zoo@web.de. May-Sep 14:00-19:00.

It is the centre of national and international banking/finance and there are also many high tech, chemical and pharmaceutical companies in the Rhine-Main area. All of these are more willing to accept people with no or less than adequate German skills if you can offer any other special skills.\nLast but not least the airport and companies working for trade fairs, as well as several companies in the so called \"Industriepark Hoechst\" always need people who speak English and other (seldom spoken) languages. Especially low skilled and very high skilled jobs are available. Make sure you have the proper permits and papers; working illegally can get you into a lot of trouble.\n\n\nBuy\nFrankfurt is a great place for shopping, as it caters both to tourists and to the local population, so you can find anything from haute couture to ridiculously cheap, and most of the shopping possibilities are located in the centre.

One notable area for dining may be what is locally known as the Fressgass (a literal translation would be \"munching alley\"). The correct name of this street is Gro\u00dfe Bockenheimer Stra\u00dfe. As the nickname implies, the Fressgass features many caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and deli food stores. It is a popular area to dine after going shopping. Take the subway to station Hauptwache  U1  U2  U3  U6  U7  U8  or Alte Oper  U6  U7 .

Traditional Italian Restaurant close by to the Alte Oper and Deutsche Bank in Westend. (updated Jan 2023)\n\n\nDrink\nFrankfurt is a young city where socialising and parties are always high on the agenda. Sachsenhausen, Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and the city centre are the main areas of action.\nDue to Frankfurt's large financial industry and business travellers, parts of its nightlife cater to a more upscale audience. At some such venues, sneakers may not be acceptable. However, there are also plenty of bars and clubs for other kinds of audiences, including for students, hipsters, fans of R&B and Hip Hop, or of alternative rock music.\nFor a quick beverage on the go, there are also small shops all over the town called Trinkhalle, which are usually open well into the night. Most of the times one orders and buys directly from the street. Drinking alcohol on the street is legal in Germany.\nNear the central train station there is a rather seedy red light district \u2013 heavily patrolled by police/Ordnungsamt \u2013 with large brothels, porn cinemas and bars. Strip clubs like the Golden Gate Frankfurt are popular for bachelor/bachelorette parties at the weekend and similar joints are in walking distance. Check pricing upfront to avoid problems with bouncers afterwards.\n\n\nBars\nWhile mostly associated with Sachsenhausen, you will find good bars all over the city.\n\n1 22nd Lounge and Bar, Neue Mainzer Str. 66-68 (Alte Oper  U6  U7  / Taunusanlage).

Don't mind a long queue, the crew is dedicated and you will never wait more than five minutes for your coffee \u20ac2. \n\n\nClubs\nThere are many clubs in Frankfurt that cater to business people and organise corporate events. The German favour for electronic music results in a wide variation of clubs that offer this music. Alternative music is a niche market that cater the roots of the migrants in Frankfurt.\n\n13 Batschkapp (Nachtleben), Gwinnerstra\u00dfe 5 (Gwinnerstra\u00dfe  U4  U7 ), \u260f +49 69 952 184 10.

Most locals drink their ebbelwoi with a dash of sparkling water. Just order a glass by asking for a \"Sauergespritzte\" or simply a \"Sauer\". People who are not used to the taste may also prefer to order a sweeter version, a \"S\u00fc\u00dfgespritzte\", which is ebbelwoi with a dash of lemonade, though this might earn you some disapproving looks from locals. If you are in a group you can also order a Bembel. This is a traditional clay jug that comes in different sizes and keeps the apple wine cool (this is also a good souvenir that you can buy in some stores). Possmann is a well-known brand of ebbelwoi, while the \"Frau Rauscher\" edition has a pleasant natural taste with some yeast left into it.\nMispelchen are another more recent local specialty and tend to be available in the same kinds of traditional restaurants and taverns that serve ebbelwoi. A Mispelchen is served in a small glass and consists of apple brandy and a whole loquat fruit on a tooth pick as well as optionally some loquat syrup.\nAlt-Sachsenhausen, a part of the suburb Sachsenhausen south of the Main river, is particularly famous for its bars and Kneipen (a German type of pub) serving ebbelwoi. However, these days, some parts of Sachsenhausen are mostly for tourists. Good options in Alt-Sachsenhausen are Dauth-Schneider, Struwwelpeter and Lorsbacher Thal. Another option in Sachsenhausen is along Textorstra\u00dfe, a two minute walk south, where you can still find a row of authentic places catering to locals (Germania, Kanonensteppel, Feuerr\u0101dchen).\nNot as famous as Alt-Sachsenhause, but also well known, is Bornheim (located in the north) which also some biergarden-like ebbelwoi establishments on 'Berger Stra\u00dfe' and the surrounding area. Some of the popular traditional ebbelwoi places in Bornheim are Solzer, Zur Sonne and Zur Schoenen M\u00fcllerin.\n\n\nSleep\nFrankfurt has plenty of accommodation but during major trade fairs, prices at even the cheapest hotels will suddenly skyrocket with charges of over \u20ac300/night quite common. Plan well ahead and alternatively, consider staying in nearby cities like Darmstadt, Neu-Isenburg, Bad Homburg, Mainz or Wiesbaden which are under an hour away by S-Bahn. If none of these works then Mannheim might be a last resort as it is 30mins by ICE high-speed train (but the train ticket is rather expensive unless bought in advance).\nFrankfurt is the banking capital of Germany so most people are business travellers with an expense account. If you intend to stay for longer periods, ask for discounts or corporate rates. If you need to depart early or arrive very late then hotels around the main station are a valid alternative to expensive airport hotels as it is just a 10-minute ride from Terminal 1 by local train. See the Frankfurt Airport article for accommodation options in the vicinity of the airport.\nMany of the hotels in Frankfurt are located around the Hauptbahnhof, but this is also the red light district in Frankfurt and is also known for the many beggars and druggies who hang around. Although the area is well policed and quite safe, many tourists are often left with a somewhat negative impression of Frankfurt after staying in this area.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Five Elements Hostel, Moselstr. 40 (5 min walk from main station), \u260f +49 69 2400-5885, welcome@5elementshostel.de.

Dorms, family and single rooms. \n\n\nMid-range\nThe mid-range segment is the main battle ground between privately owned/run hotels and the major chain hotels (Mercure, Courtyard, Meininger etc.). During the weekends and at non trade fair dates substantial discounts are possible but vice-versa during trade fairs prices at least triple!\n\n6 Hotel Ambassador, Moselstra\u00dfe 12 (Near the central station), \u260f +49 69 256110. Rooms are okay, proximity to the train station a plus (about 5 minutes on foot). Near the red light district which is a minus (you don't have to actually walk through the red light district to get to the hotel though). \n7 Hotel am Berg, Grethenweg 23 (Frankfurt S\u00fcd  U1  U2  U3  U8  S5  S6 ), \u260f +49 69 660537-0, hotelamberg@aol.com. The place is decorated kind of old-style. 20 minutes walk to the centre. It is an old half-timbered style mansion, giving more the feeling of a B&B than a hotel and each room has its own eccentric d\u00e9cor. \u20ac49-. \n8 Hotel Concorde, Karlstra\u00dfe 9 (main station), \u260f +49 69-2424220.

Small and clean hotel opposite main station, so perfect for early departures and/or late arrivals. Free WLAN and good buffet breakfast with multilingual staff. Rooms are good but avoid rooms facing the street as the area is busy late at night \n12 Novotel Frankfurt City, Lise-Meitner-Stra\u00dfe 2 (next to trade fair ground), \u260f +49 69-793030. 235+ rooms in a solid business traveller hotel.

Splendid views from upper floors as most other towers are some distance away. \u20ac109. \n16 MGallery Hotel Savigny Fankfurt (formerly Sofitel). The former Sofitel started to age badly and rather than update it, Accor downgraded it to an MGallery. A taste of erstwhile luxury can be had at really reasonable rates outside of trade fair dates. You will, however, have to contend with worn furniture and fixtures and partially indifferent staff. The Savigny is at the border of a quiet residential lowrise district and the highrise quarter, so you can enjoy the best of both worlds - but not much in terms of views from your room. \n17 NH Frankfurt City, Vilbeler Stra\u00dfe 2. A typical example of the NH chain in Germany, with gemuetlich interior fixtures and subdued yet clashing colours that perhaps only Germans find appealing. Large windows with an openable section, good breakfast as always from NH and a location close to the old town. \n18 Mercure Frankfurt City Messe, D\u00fcsseldorfer Stra\u00dfe 20. This Mercure thrives only on its very convenient location, as its rooms have been outdated for far too long and other areas leave much to be desired at well. \n19 NH Frankfurt Messe, Friedrich- Ebert - Anlage 38. The other NH in Frankfurt is a more contemporary affair, with rooms featuring fresh green accents in line with NH's latest interior design guidelines. \n20 Radisson BLU Hotel, Franklinstra\u00dfe 65 (Tram 17 An der Dammheide), \u260f +49 69 770 1550.

It is just located at the border of R\u00f6delheim and Bockenheim. \n21 Hilton Garden Inn Frankfurt Airport (inside the Squaire building), \u260f +49 69 4500 2500, info.frankfurtairport@hilton.com.

(updated Oct 2020)\n\n\nNiederrad\nMany hotels billed as \"Frankfurt Airport\" are in the district of Frankfurt-Niederrad between the airport and city proper. The Frankfurt-Niederrad  S7  S8  S9  S-Bahn is just one station away from the airport station. The hotels are within walking distance of the train station, but most at a distance you would not want to drag a suitcase.\n\n22 Dorint Hotel Frankfurt Niederrad, Hahnstra\u00dfe 9, \u260f +49 69 663060, Info.Frankfurt-Niederrad@dorint.com. 4-star hotel. from \u20ac64 per room/night.

Furthermore if you count crime per person, you don't include a good chunk of people working but not living in Frankfurt.\nPhysical crime is in general concentrated in the red-light district around the central train station, which is also the hangout of many drug dealers/junkies, although even there you are usually safe during the day and moderate evening hours. Frankfurt is safe and it is highly unlikely that you will face armed robbery or other violent crimes. Use your common sense and avoid drunken or aggressive people at night. In general, firearms are an uncommon sight in Germany and the police have a very no-nonsense approach to people wielding guns or even knives. If shots are fired, the police are never far away, as this very rarely happens.\nIf you have a problem or are being harassed, ask the police for help. The German police and the Frankfurt Ordnungsamt (City Enforcement Officers) are clean, competent and willing to help. Germany is very bureaucratic but structured; as long as you behave respectfully toward the police, you should have no problem. Don't consider buying and smuggling drugs, these are major offences with dire consequences. Lately, bogus police officers have been an issue. All real officers have a green card with photograph and number, and no officer will check cash. Ring 110 if you get in any trouble.\n\n\nDrugs and beggars\nThe central station area (Hauptbahnhof) is known for being a centre for homeless people and drug users. The situation has improved, but you will still occasionally be bothered by beggars. The drug addicts generally don't bother people, and the beggars will ask for Kleingeld (small change), which by their definition is anything between \u20ac0.20 and two euro.  One way to fend off beggars is just to say you do not speak German (and this might just be true for you anyway!). They will often switch to English then, so just pretend you can not speak that either (just shake your head, or say \"No English\").\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nInternet\nThere are a number of Internet caf\u00e9s in Frankfurt of varying prices and quality. Free Wi-Fi at coffee shops is getting more and more common but most businesses require some purchases of food or the likes to get the code. La maison du pain offers Wi-Fi. Various other hotels offer Internet access but usually at a charge.\nBurger King (corner Liebfrauenstra\u00dfe / Holzgraben) near Hauptwache  U1  U2  U3  U6  U7  U8  offers free Wi-Fi in its restaurant, as does Starbucks near Hauptwache (B\u00f6rsenplatz).\n\n\nPhone\nBesides public pay phones and mobile phone services, a large number of stores sell prepaid telephone cards. This is especially useful for international calls. The PTT multi-media store - 65 Baseler Stra\u00dfe, offers competitive rates for international calls (10 cents per min to the UK) Some other stores also offer in house phone services. Another easy to reach store that seems reliable is in the Hauptwache  U1  U2  U3  U6  U7  U8  subway station.\nYou may also visit one of the plenty Internet caf\u00e9s, since they almost all offer cheap phone calls via Internet.\n\n\nPost offices\nThe postal service in Germany is Deutsche Post. The four easiest-to-reach full-service postal offices are easy to locate:\n\nInside Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (central station) by the long-distance ICE/IC trains; near McDonalds.\nOn Goetheplatz\nAt Frankfurt S\u00fcd  U1  U2  U3  U8  S5  S6  (i.e., S\u00fcdbahnhof, Southern Station), take exit Diesterwegplatz and cross the square; the post office is to the left.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nConsulates\n  Indonesia, Zeppelinallee 23, \u260f +49-69 247-0980, kjriffm@kjriffm.de.
