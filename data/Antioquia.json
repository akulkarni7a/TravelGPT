  "extract": "Antioquia is a department in the Andino region of Colombia. It is famous for its many coffee plantations.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Medell\u00edn - Considered by many as the best city in Colombia. Medell\u00edn is home to the famous yearly \"Flower Festival\" in August and the first (and still only) metro system in the country: \"Metro de Medell\u00edn\". Home City of Juanes, Fernando Botero and Ren\u00e9 Higuita.  The metropolitan area is surrounded by many small towns which have become virtual suburbs of the city.  These include Envigado, Itagu\u00ed, Sabaneta and Caldas (south); Bello, Copacabana and Girardota (north).  The spread of the city east and west is limited by topography.\n2 Apartad\u00f3   town and municipality in Urab\u00e1 subregion\n3 Capurgan\u00e1 even though outside of Antioquia it is easier to get there from Medell\u00edn by plane or by boat from Turbo. A great, quiet beach destination in the Atlantic, near Panam\u00e1.\n4 Granada  - is a town in the east of Antioquia. It's a zone of water, cool weather, but hot people. In this place you can  say \"Home, sweet home\". It was the cradle of Bishop Tiberio de J. Salazar y Herrera.\n5 Guatape \u2013 A pretty lakeside town with hostels available.\n6 Jard\u00edn is a beautiful little town 2 hours south of Medell\u00edn, with incredible tourist attractions: a gorgeous main plaza, distinctive local architecture amd many country-side activities. Look for the locally produced rainbow trout and coffee to please your senses. There are hostels.\n7 Jerico is a small town a few hours south of Medell\u00edn, a quieter and less touristy option to nearby Jardin which has had a huge increase in visitors in the 2020s.\n8 Marinilla, Rionegro, Guarne and La Ceja these are small towns east of Medell\u00edn and a popular day trip destination.\n9 Necocl\u00ed - small town on the Gulf of Uraba, home of a large Afro-Colombian population\n10 Santa Fe de Antioquia , the oldest capital. A quaint colonial town, 50 km northwest of Medell\u00edn.\n11 Turbo - The small city on the Caribbean coast itself doesn't have a lot to offer, and its primary interest to travelers is its role as the place to get a boat to Capurgan\u00e1, from where it is possible to get a boat to Puerto Obaldia in Panama.\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are 6 operational airports with daily commercial flights in Antioquia.\n\n\nInternational Airport\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova (MDE IATA) in Rionegro, serves Medell\u00edn.\n\n\nNational Airports\nOlaya Herrera (EOH IATA) in Medell\u00edn.\nAntonio Rold\u00e1n Betancourt (APO IATA), Formerly Los Cedros.

The metro runs largely along the north-south axis of the city.\n\n\nBy cable car\nAntioquia is mountainous hence Cable Cars have sprawled in the last 2 decades and are becoming popular for both commuting and tourist transportation.  You can ride the Metrocables in Medell\u00edn which are additional lines of the Metro system or the countryside cable-cars in many small towns in Antioquia: Jard\u00edn, Jeric\u00f3, Sopetr\u00e1n, San Andr\u00e9s de Cuerquia, etc.\n\n\nSee\n\n . Also by rental cars and trucks. \n\n\nItineraries\nSan Jeronimo, Sopetran and Santa Fe de Antioquia - Going north-west from downtown Medell\u00edn, you arrive at the longest and newest South American tunnel: 4.7 km. After you pass through that tunnel, you start descending mountains and a few minutes later, you are in San Jeronimo, Antioquia. Cruise it on motorcycle, the fun way, don't be scared because it's an awesome experience! Weather here is 25 degrees during the whole year. Very close you will find Sopetran, the Antioquias fruits lovely capital. Finally, you get to Santa Fe de Antioquia, one of the five colonial destinations in Colombia, and the way to the Caribbean. This road will take you to Turbo and to the Panama frontier line - the road is more safe now and is not frequented by guerrillas and paramilitaries anymore.\nFrontino further to the west, is a nice town.\n\n\nDo\n\nThe Holy Week in many towns of Antioquia is colorful and passionate.\n\n\nEat\nBandeja Paisa\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\nAct as you would in any large, and potentially unsafe metropolitan area such as Chicago or S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nAs of 2010 there were plenty of landmines in the countryside, making much of Antioquia out of bounds for tourists.\nThere are guerrillas of ELN active in many rural locations of this department. They will kidnap for ransom and hold little sympathy for tourists.\nDue to the high amounts of violence in the region the Australian Foreign Office advises against travelling to Antioquia. This travel warning was issued in December of 2010 [1]\nDon't buy drugs, or even ask about them.\nDo not get in a taxi if there is someone other than the driver in it\nAvoid downtown and Parque Berrio at night.\nAvoid walking around like you're lost, as this may be noticed by the wrong sort of people; if you are lost step in to a cafe or \"tienda\", restaurant, ask someone there.\nIt's best to use ATMs located in Exito, Carrefour, Carulla or Pomona (supermarkets in the Medell\u00edn area) or to use the ones inside the banks,\nAlways  be aware that you might be followed from ATMs and banks.\n\n\nGo next",
