  "extract": "Estonia (Estonian: Eesti) is a Baltic gem offering visitors the chance to see a tiny dynamic land on the shores of the sea. The northernmost and smallest of the Baltic states, Estonia has charming old towns and heritage back to the Hanseatic League. Tallinn's old town was built in the Middle Ages, but is in magnificent condition, with the city walls and towers almost completely intact, and it rates as one of Europe's best medieval old towns. Visitors can also experience an ex-Soviet republic that is now part of the European Union. Traces of the Soviet era are still there to be seen, e.g. Paldiski, a deserted Soviet army base that was once off-limits to Estonians themselves, can easily be visited on a day trip from the capital, Tallinn. Estonia is renowned for its bucolic islands and extensive bogs that are now national parks with easy access for tourists. Glorious beaches pepper the extensive coastline, although the swimming season is short \u2014 after all, the Baltics are not renowned for warm weather.\n\n\nRegions\nEstonia is divided into 15 counties (maakond). To bring out the unique characteristics of Estonia, this guide uses four regions. As the country is small, most destinations can be reached within a couple of hours from Tallinn.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Tallinn \u2013 The cosmopolitan capital is also the financial centre of Estonia. With its medieval old town, Tallinn is beautiful and, compared to other Estonian towns, expensive.\n2 Tartu \u2013 This museum-rich Hanseatic city on the banks of the Emaj\u00f5gi River is Estonia's second-largest and oldest city, an intellectual hub famous for its universities and lively student atmosphere.\n3 Narva \u2013 Estonia's easternmost and third largest city, on the Narva River, which is the border with Russia. Famous for the Hermann Castle, right opposite Ivangorod's castle, and the Kreenholm factories.\n4 P\u00e4rnu \u2013 Estonia's fourth largest city and summer capital, popular for its balneotherapy complexes and spa centres, surrounded by numerous beaches.\n5 Rakvere \u2013 Estonia's fifth largest city, east of Tallinn, famous for its punk and rock festivals and spirit.\n6 Haapsalu \u2013 the \"Venice of the north\" is a major seaside resort and port city, good for visiting spas, taking mud baths, sailing, and swimming. It also has interesting landmarks, like the cathedral, the castle ruins, and the picturesque railway museum.\n7 Viljandi \u2013 A beautiful, ancient and hilly city, known for its annual folk music festival, old town, and scenic park around the ruined castle.\n8 Kuressaare \u2013 The only town on the island of Saaremaa, the location of Kuressaare Castle. It also has many spas, water parks, and a beach.\n9 Valga \u2013 A town on the border with Latvia, where it literally grows into the Latvian town of Valka.\n\n\nOther destinations\n\nEstonians have a special love for nature, and many will tell you that they would rather sit under a tree in an empty forest or hike in a national park than almost anything else. Estonia's tranquil, laidback and unspoiled Baltic Sea islands provide a splendid getaway to nature.\n\n\nNational parks\n1 Lahemaa National Park \u2013 On the coast within an hour east (50 km) of Tallinn. Given its size it is the largest park in Estonia and one of Europe's biggest national parks, with 1,000 km2 of bogs, trails, and forests.\n2 Soomaa National Park \u2013 the second largest national park in Estonia, famous for its \"fifth season\". A peat bog formed from a glacier melt from around 11,000 years ago.\n3 Matsalu National Park \u2013 one of the largest and most important autumn stopping grounds for migratory birds in Europe. Excellent for birdwatchers, due it is rich ornithological species.\n4 Vilsandi National Park \u2013 rich in marine fauna, and international bird sanctuary with over 250 recorded bird species, on the west coast of Saaremaa. Covers 238 km2, including 163 km2 of sea and 75 km2 of land, plus 160 islands and islets.\n5 Karula National Park \u2013 the hilly landscapes of Southern Estonia. Estonian\u2019s smallest national park between Valga and V\u00f5ru.\n6 Alutaguse National Park \u2013 the newest national park that covers a sparsly populated area in Northeastern Estonia that is south from towns like J\u00f5hvi and Narva. This park was created in order to protect last few habitats of flying squirrels in Estonia itself.\n7 Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Nature Park and Lake P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve \u2013 Part of the Otep\u00e4\u00e4 recreational region with an area beyond 3,000 km\u00b2. Trails along the lake and paths in the hilly forests.\n Meenikunno Nature Park \u2013 A 5 km hike and wooden trail with an observation platform in the middle of the swamps.\n\n\nIslands\n8 Saaremaa \u2013 The largest Estonian and wild seaside character island with castles and fortresses, one perfectly preserved, a beach, a spa and famous mills. Saaremaa is even sometimes called Sparemaa. Furthermore, the island is surrounded by a myriad of tiny islands including Abruka with its nudist camps.\n9 Hiiumaa \u2013 The second largest Estonian island. Popular for its lighthouses, ancient churches, historical values and the sense of humour of its inhabitants, but scarcely populated. In winter, it can sometimes be reached by car via an ice bridge on the Baltic Sea.\n10 Kihnu \u2013 The southernmost group of islands, Kihnu, is on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Cosy and warm yet exotic \u2013 folk costumes are worn here every day and the handicraft of older generations remains highly valued.\n11 Muhu \u2013 The third largest Estonian island, and a rural municipality connected to the nearby Saaremaa by an artificial embankment, where ferries to the harbour of Virtsu arrive. Has an open air museum, and its locals are known for still sewing woollen clothes. Sleepy fishing villages, working windmills, thatched cottages, plenty of deer, moose and birds.\n12 Ruhnu \u2013 The communal territory corresponds to that of the homonymous island, formerly known as Run\u00f6.\n13 Vormsi \u2013 The fourth largest Estonian island, very close to the mainland. Vormsi is a small island covered with forests and a Swedish community. A unique blend of Soviet and Swedish history mixed with unspoilt nature.\nOsmussaare \u2013 A small and mostly inaccessible island in the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, 7.5 km off the mainland, and part of the Noarootsi Parish.\nPakri \u2013 Two islands in the Gulf of Finland: Suur-Pakri and V\u00e4ike-Pakri (Swedish: Stora R\u00e5g\u00f6 and Lilla R\u00e5g\u00f6), administratively part of Paldiski.\nNaissaar \u2013 An island mostly covered by forest northwest of Tallinn with about 35 residents.\nPrangli \u2013 A small island with, harbour (for ferries to Leppneeme on the mainland), mainly fir trees, and a lighthouse from 1923.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSome visitors tend to see the Baltic states as being similar countries with regional differences. They share a common recent history: the three countries declared independence in 1918 at the collapse of the Russian Empire, were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, by Nazi Germany in 1941, and again by the Soviet Union from 1944 until independence was restored in 1991. However, there are differences between the countries' languages (Estonians speak a Finnic language unlike Latvia or Lithuania) and religion (Estonians are irreligious, Latvians are mostly Lutherans, and Lithuanians are Catholics). Also, Estonia is more oriented towards Northern Europe, while Lithuania is oriented towards Central Europe.\nTourism to Estonia has been growing, with statistics showing a jump from 1.8 million to 6 million foreign visitors between 2005 and 2015.\n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Nordic history, Russian Empire, Soviet Union\nAfter seven centuries of German, Danish, Swedish, Polish and Russian rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Occupied and forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1940, it re-gained independence in 1991 through its \"Singing Revolution\", a non-violent movement that overthrew an initially violent occupation. Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia moved to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. It is now one of the more prosperous former Communist states, enjoying a high-tech environment, an open and liberal economy and a transparent government system. On the other hand, it is faced with a fairly low (but growing) GDP per capita and modest long-term population decline. In 2011, the euro was adopted as the official currency.\n\n\nPeople\nEstonia is bigger than the Netherlands or Denmark by area, but is one of the least densely populated countries in the EU, with 1.3 million people. Ethnic Estonians make up 69% of the population, and Russians 26%. The heaviest concentrations of Russians are in the north-east (Ida-Viru County) and Tallinn. Most of Estonia's ethnic Russians are stateless permanent residents, being allowed to remain in Estonia, but not eligible to vote in elections or work in government jobs, as the Estonian government requires them to pass tests that prove their fluency in the Estonian language to be eligible for naturalisation. Due to its close cultural and linguistic ties with Finland, many ethnic Estonians consider themselves Nordic, as they are not Balts, and regard Estonia's classification as a Baltic state as mainly a geographical convenience.\nEstonia has the least religious population in the European Union: 14% are Lutherans (mostly ethnic Estonians) and 13% are Eastern Orthodox (mostly ethnic Russians, although there is a small Estonian Orthodox population). The native Estonian attitude towards Christianity may differ from the other Europeans attitude (Finns and Russians are good example) since Christianity was forced on native Estonians in 13th century by German crusader conquest and used to consolidate the German nobility's power over native Estonians for the next 700 years.\n\n\nGeography\n\nClimate\nMaritime, wet, moderate winters, short and cool summers.\nTerrain\nMarshy, lowlands; flat in the north, hilly in the south\nHighest point\nSuur Munam\u00e4gi (literally Big Egg Mountain) 318 m above sea level, in the south east, 20 km north of the main highway that runs from Riga in Latvia to Russia, close to the borders with both countries. It is the highest point in the Baltic states.\nGeography\nThe mainland terrain is flat, boggy, and partly wooded; offshore lie more than 1,500 islands and islets.\nNature\nWorld War II and the subsequent occupation were devastating on humans, but the destruction and the closure of large areas for military use actually increased Estonia's forest coverage from about 25% before the war to more than 50% by 1991. Wolves, bears, lynx, elk and deer as well as some rare bird and plant species are abundant. Wild animals are exported to some EU countries for forest re-population programmes. Most animals can be hunted, subject to annual quotas.\n\n\nHolidays\n\nNational holiday : Independence Day, 24 February; this day in 1918 was the first date of independence from Soviet Russia (20 August 1991 was the date of re-independence from the Soviet Union). Each 24 February, a grand ball is held by the president for the prominent and important members of society and foreign dignitaries. If you happen to be traveling in Tallinn on that particular day, make sure you get to witness the national flag raising ceremony at the Pikk Hermann Tower in the morning and admire the traditional military parade.\nJaanip\u00e4ev : St John's Day or Midsummer Day held on the night of 23\u201324 June. The evening of the 23rd and well into the morning of the 24th is celebrated with bonfires and a traditional festive menu concentrating on barbeques and drinking.\nV\u00f5idup\u00fcha (Victory Day) :  23 June is celebrated to commemorate the decisive victory over Baltic German forces in 1919 during the War of Independence.\nTaasiseseisvumisp\u00e4ev (Day of Restoration of Independence) : 20 August is celebrated about Estonia's separation from the Soviet Union and the country's restoration of independence in 1991.\nChristmas or J\u00f5ulud : Celebrated strictly as a family event.\nNew Year's Eve : As a Soviet province, the authorities sought to promote the New Year holiday, as Christmas was all but forbidden for its alleged \"religious\" and \"nationalist\" character. After the restoration of independence, the significance of the New Year decreased, but it is still a day off and celebrated. This day is used by the leaders of the country to address the nation.\n\n\nTourist information\nVisit Estonia\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Estonian phrasebook\nThe official language is Estonian. Unlike most other European languages, Estonian is part of the Finno-Ugric language family, which includes languages such as Finnish and Hungarian. Estonian is unrelated to almost every language between Iceland and India, making it a challenging language to master.\nEnglish is widely spoken and understood among the younger generation who were schooled after 1990. Older generations, however, typically do not speak any English.\nRussian is spoken by a significant portion of the population (about 30%) in Estonia, and is the native language of the ethnic Russian minority. During the Soviet era, Russian was compulsory in schools, which means that many older people are able to speak it to one degree or another. Certain neighborhoods of Tallinn and towns near the Russian border, such as Narva and Kohtla-J\u00e4rve in Ida-Virumaa, have ethnic Russian majorities, where Russian is commonly spoken. Over 95% of the population of Narva are native Russian speakers, and over 85% are ethnic Russians, so if you are heading towards Narva, it would be advisable to have some basics of the Russian language; English proficiency is significantly lower in Narva.\nGiven the difficult, complex relationship between Russia and Estonia, some ethnic Estonians may find it offensive if you try to talk to them in Russian, as it may be seen as an attempt to undermine their national identity and culture. Conversely, many ethnic Russians in Estonia, particularly the older generation, do not speak Estonian well or at all.  \nWith regards to other foreign languages, Finnish is also spoken quite well by many people in Tallinn and major tourist spots, thanks to heavy tourism and TV broadcasts from the other side of the gulf during the 1990s. Finnish language knowledge in Estonia is on a decline because most Finns can communicate in English, reducing the need for Estonians to speak it, and Finnish-language TV has not been available for over a decade as it was in 1990s. As both languages are similar, it can be possible to hold a basic conversation if you speak slowly and be aware one may not understand everything 100% or even 50%. German was once a popular language to learn at school in Estonia, and a large number of people (estimates vary from 10% to 25% of the population) can speak some. However, this is increasingly debatable. According to the Goethe institute branch in Estonia, German language education is declining, despite heavy tourism from Germany and important trade between the two countries. Though still rather uncommon, French and Spanish have gained popularity in the 2010s, especially among Tallinn's upper class.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nVisa\nEstonia is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\n\n\nBy plane\nTallinn (TLL IATA) is Estonia's main international gateway. In addition to direct daily flights to/from all major Scandinavian (Stockholm Arlanda, Copenhagen Airport, and Oslo) and Baltic cities (Riga and Vilnius), there are direct flights from many major European hubs like London, Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport, Brussels and Amsterdam Schiphol, and Warsaw. Eastward connections are from Kyiv (temporarily suspended). AirBaltic provides the majority of the service, with the rest being provided by Finnair, SAS, Lufthansa, LOT and others. Easyjet, Ryanair, and Wizzair provide low-cost options to Tallinn, albeit from far fewer places than most international airports in neighbouring countries.\nClose proximity and excellent ferry services with Helsinki allow for combination of open-jaw air travel. Riga is only 2-3 hr bus ride from southern Estonia and may be another good option.\nOther Estonian airports are mostly used for domestic services, although Tartu has a daily connection to Helsinki, whereas P\u00e4rnu and Kuressaare may have sporadic flights to Stockholm.\n\n\nBy car\n\nGood road connections are to the south (Via Baltica routing Tallinn-Riga-Kaunas-Warsaw) and east (Tallinn-Saint Petersburg, Tallinn-Pskov). Any car travel to Russia involves unpredictable delays at the border. The Narva/Ivangorod border crossing is notorious for its half-day-long queues, so use the southern crossing in Pechory whenever possible and pay special attention to the ticketing system that books you a place in the queue on the Estonian side. Baltic Sea ferries often also take cars.\n\n\nBy bus\nLots of good and cheap connections from Riga and Saint Petersburg to Tallinn. Long-distance service from Vilnius, Kaunas, Kaliningrad, and even Warsaw or Kyiv is also available. The most popular regular service provider is Luxexpress Group, others include Ecolines and FlixBus.\nSince, the available bus companies might change over time, use bus comparison sites like this one: https://www.busradar.com\n\n\nBy boat\nFerry lines connect Tallinn with Sweden (Stockholm) and Finland (Helsinki, Mariehamn). Tallinn-Helsinki is one of the busiest sea routes in Europe and has daily 11 ferry crossings and 6-7 different fast-boat crossings (not during the winter) in each direction. Ferries are operated by Tallink, Viking Line and Ecker\u00f6 Line. Ferry tickets can be as low as \u20ac19 for a single or return (usually the return is free if returning the same day; they want day cruisers who supposedly spend more on board).\nMinor international ferry connections include Paldiski - Kapellsk\u00e4r (Sweden) and Paldiski - Hanko (Finland). They are operated by DFDS Seaways.\nFor information regarding entering Estonia with your own boat, visit State Port Register and the Estonian Maritime Administration webpage for Recreational Craft.\n\n\nBy train\nInternational train services between Tallinn on the one hand and Moscow and Saint Petersburg in Russia on the other have been suspended several times in the past. The Russian Railways (RZD) runs the connection Moscow-Tallinn (via St. Petersburg) with daily night trains. Trains depart from Moscow at 21:20 and arrive in Tallinn at 13.38. Services from Tallinn depart at 15:20 and arrive in Moscow at 09:32. As of 2023, the train service to Russia is suspended. The widely (and somewhat blatantly) advertised Riga-to-Tallinn train connection is anything but reasonable, because it makes a long detour and takes you nearly a whole day for a simple trip between the neighbouring Baltic capitals. However, local trains from northern Latvia to southern Estonia (connection in Valka/Valga) may be useful. Valka/Valga is also the only railway border crossing between Latvia and Estonia. The trains at the border crossing do not connect very well, so be prepared to spend a couple of hours there.\n\n\nGet around\nIn Estonia, the public transport system is well-developed.\nAs of July 1, 2018, Estonia will have created the largest 24/7 free public transit zone in the world for local residents.\n\n\nBy bus\nEstonia has a comprehensive bus network all over the country. Nearly every city can be accessed by a direct bus from Tallinn or Tartu. Other big cities have their own bus routes, such as Narva\u2013P\u00e4rnu. Beside that, most of the towns and villages have regular bus connections to the nearby larger cities and towns. Smaller places are often only served in the morning or noon, and late afternoon (17:00/18:00). City connections generally operate up to 21:00. Make sure not to miss the last bus, or not to get stuck during daytime in a smaller town or village.\nAll connections are available online through Tpilet.ee (for long distance connections) and Peatus.ee (for short distances and local connections \u2013 enter/choose the exact station name to get meaningful results; e.g. \"Tallinna bussijaam\" and not \"Tallinn\"). Load a pilet.ee mobile app to buy local bus tickets. The websites and apps are mostly available in Estonian, English, and Russian. You can always buy tickets from the driver, except in Tallinn public transport.\nYou can also buy tickets for many connections online with Tpilet.ee or Tpilet bussipiletid app. Sometimes the mobile site does not show the purchase option, and you might want to switch your smartphone web browser to \"Desktop mode\". It is sometimes more preferable to buy a bus ticket online, especially with Simple Express or Eesti Buss buses. So check ahead, and if there is still time, buy right before the trip, or even in advance if you have a specific plan. This even applies to short distances, where instead of \u20ac2.50 the online price is \u20ac1.50 (or so) with Simple Express. If the purchase is not displayed with Tpilet.ee, check directly with Eesti Buss or Lux Express.\nNevertheless, tickets bought online are only cheaper with certain companies, like Simple Express, which also allows e-tickets on your mobile. For other companies, online tickets need to be printed and cannot be used on your mobile (like for Go Bus). But there are self-service terminals in the city bus terminal to print out such tickets. Some buses do not have power, in case you want to charge your phone (Simple Express has, Go Bus does not).\nRegarding finding the right bus stop, especially for longer distances, buses do not go into each and every town but rather stop at the nearest point along the highway. These stops are denoted with \"... tee\", like \"Loksa tee\" instead of Loksa the town. Make sure you know where to enter and where to get off the bus, considering this. Also, an online search for a connection might not come up with any connection because you simple chose the wrong bus stops.\n\n\nBy train\n\nEstonia's train network does not cover the whole country. The quality of railway tracks and services is steadily improving, thanks to substantial EU funding. The old Soviet diesel machines have been replaced with modern European trains.\nSince 2014 all domestic passenger rail operations have been taken over by Elron, whose website does offer timetables, journey planner and prices.\nTickets are sold on board. You can buy your ticket after boarding the train from the ticket machines in the train lobbies by paying by debit card (-10% off) or from the conductor. You can also buy them online, at major stations, or in one of the rare ticket machines, but this makes sense mostly for 1st class tickets that are limited in number and may be sold out. All ticket prices are discounted -10% when purchased from the Internet. \nFor first class numbered seats, you will need an advance ticket purchased online (other passengers can see your reservation by the red seat number instead of the green one above the seat on the edge of the hat rack). A standard fare (2nd class) ticket does not guarantee a seat at peak times (which are usually Friday and Sunday evenings).\nTrain connection and price information is also available through Peatus.ee.\nTicket prices are fairly low \u2013 1st class travel from Tallinn to Tartu costs \u20ac12.60-15.00 one-way.\n\n\nBy car\nMost roads have two lanes, but some national highways (Tallinn-Tartu, Tallinn-P\u00e4rnu, Tallinn-Narva and Tallinn ring road) have 4 lanes in some segments (mainly closer to Tallinn). All national highways are of very good road quality (wide 1+1 roads with lane markings). The road quality on other roads varies. As of 2019, out of 16,600 km of highways in Estonia, 4,900 km were paved and another 3,600 km were chipsealed.\nThe speed limit is 90 km/h in the countryside and 50 km/h in cities, unless specified otherwise.\n\nOnly in summer is 110 km/h introduced on selected highways (generally dual carriageways with at least 2 lanes in each direction), and the scope is reconsidered every summer. Motorway signs are not present in winter.\nStationary speed cameras are frequent on major highways. Waze mobile app has a decent coverage of speed limits and stationary cameras, which is most helpful on long drives.\n\nUnlike Russia and some other countries, urban areas are always marked with an \"urban area\" sign. Conversely, a road sign with a settlement name on blue blackground is not necessarily an indicator of an urban area.\nFines for exceeding the limit by 20 km/h is up to \u20ac120, for +21-40 km/h up to \u20ac400 and risk of license withdrawn; up to \u20ac1200 for more. Ignoring red traffic signal is up to \u20ac800. Violating the no-overtaking is up to \u20ac800.\nDrunk driving is not tolerated and has hefty fines. Driving under the influence of alcohol is fined up to \u20ac800 for exceeding 0.2\u2030. Beware of drunk pedestrians, as they are not uncommon.\nLights must always be switched on. All passengers are expected to wear seat belts.\nParking should be paid for in the central areas of bigger cities. In central Tallinn paid parking applies 24/7. Parking is normally paid over phone, either in app (the most convenient method) or by a text message (may not be available on international phone numbers). There is a limited number of pay and display machines available. Prepare coins in advance, as credit cards and paper money are only accepted by parking machines in large indoor parkings, while breaking money can be difficult to find nearby.\nEstonia has lots of car rental companies, and the level of English spoken by their representatives is generally very high. Rental is somewhat cheaper than in Western Europe. Smartphone app based car rental services include Bolt Drive and CityBee. ELMO Rent offers minute based car rental.\n\nDriving in Estonia is fairly easy. Drivers are generally polite (with some exceptions so stay alert), and obeying speed limits and other traffic rules.\nThere isn't very much traffic on the Estonian highways compared to Western Europe or for example Poland. Traffic jams with minimal delays may occur in Tallinn during rush hours.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaksod.net is a portal about taxis in Estonia.\nRide-hailing is popular in Estonia and the following are the most anticipated providers:\n\n Bolt. Popular in Estonia and includes many towns. (updated Jul 2020)\n Uber. Works only in the region in and around Tallinn. (updated Jul 2020)\nForus Taxi (smartphone app)\n\n\nBy thumb\nHitchhiking in Estonia is generally possible. Where in the past it was more common, people are quite reserved nowadays, especially when seeing tourists that they expect to only speak English, which middle aged or older Estonians may not understand.\nHence, success is very volatile. You might be lucky within 10 min, or you might just wait 1\u00bd hr without anyone stopping, especially in remote areas with less traffic. Do not count on getting picked up eventually, but be sure to know when the last bus departs.\n\nSee also: Hitchhiking\n\n\nBy plane\nEstonia has several domestic flights, mainly between the mainland and islands. Three of the islands have airports: Hiiumaa, Ruhnu & Kuressaare.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nThe international bicycle project BaltiCCycle may provide you with a lot of information and help.\n\n\nOn foot and navigation\nEstonia has many picturesque 1-3 day hiking trails, like in and around the Lahemaa National Park. For reliable and comprehensive (offline) maps of these trails and full map information, consult OpenStreetMap, which is also used by this travel guide, and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd (complex with many add-ons) and MAPS.ME (easy but limited).\n\n\nSee\n\n\nEstonia's top tourist attractions\nTallinn's Medieval Old Town, Tallinn, Architecture and History\nKadrioru Park, Tallinn, Architecture\nLahemaa National Park, North Estonia, Nature\nTartu Jaani (St. John's) Church, Tartu, Architecture\nP\u00e4rnu Beach, P\u00e4rnu, Recreational\nLighthouses, Hiiumaa, Architecture\nNarva Hermann Castle, Narva, Museum\nThe Kaali meteorite craters, Saaremaa, Nature\nSetomaa, South Estonia, Culture\nOtep\u00e4\u00e4 Winter Centre, Otep\u00e4\u00e4, Sports\n\n\nMedieval history and manors\n\nThe Old Town of Tallinn is the most intact and best protected medieval city in Europe, and is Estonia's premi\u00e8re attraction. Its unique value is its well-preserved (intact) medieval milieu and structure, which has been lost in most of the capitals of northern Europe. Since 1997, the Old Town has been on UNESCO's World Heritage list.\nLiving under the rule of Scandinavian kings, Russian empire and Teutonic Knights has left Estonia with unique and rich blend of historic landmarks. Over one thousand manors were built across Estonia from the 13th century onwards. Some of the manors have perished or fallen into ruins but a lot have been reconstructed and are favourite attractions with tourists. There are about 200 manor houses under state protection as architectural monuments and 100 in active use.\n\n\nIslands and coastline\n\nEstonia has over 1,500 islands. The nature is essentially untouched and offers quite a different beach experience with their remoter rustic feel. Most of the public beaches are sandy and the average water temperature is 18\u00b0C in summer. Inland waters and some shallow bays' waters are even warmer.\nThe largest island is Saaremaa with an intact and well-restored medieval castle in its only city, Kuressaare. Stone fences, thatched roofs, working windmills and home-made beer are all distinctive to Saaremaa. Hiiumaa, on the other hand, is well known for its lighthouses, unspoilt nature, the Hill of Crosses and the sense of humour of its inhabitants. Both islands have an airport and so can be quickly reached from Tallinn.\nOther important islands include Kihnu, Ruhnu (with its \"singing sand\" beach), Muhu and Vormsi, each with its own unique characteristics. Most of the other tiny Estonian islands don't carry much cultural significance, but can be appealing for bird watching, canoeing, sailing or fishing etc.\nIn July and August, P\u00e4rnu, Estonia's summer capital, is the main attraction. The coastline itself has loads of untouched beaches and a tour from Narva-J\u00f5esuu (in the east) towards Tallinn is great for exploring the coastline. Some of the well known places include Toila, V\u00f5su, K\u00e4smu and Kaberneeme.\nThe Tenet tour is a showcase of the sets of the 2020 film Tenet, most of them being in and around Tallinn.\n\n\nDo\nFrisbee \u2014 Frisbee seems to be the secret sport of Estonians. You will find many places, especially in rural areas, where the disc golf baskets can be found. So, bring a Frisbee.\nHiking \u2014 There are at least three national parks in Estonia worth a day or two of hiking. Check them out. Otherwise, there are many areas where hiking and putting up a tent near the sea can be worthwhile. The forest administration has marked several hiking trails spanning north to south and east to west. Much like in the Nordic countries, in Estonia you can freely roam in the nature, but the rules are slightly more strict here. For instance camping outside designated camping areas always requires permission from the landowner (private land) or local forest surveillance officer (public land).

July. Come and experience the medieval atmosphere of the historic Hanseatic City! You can find workshops and market with traders, participate in tours and witness exciting tournaments. \n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nEstonia uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\nThe Estonian kroon (EEK) ceased to be legal tender on 15 Jan 2011, but any kroons you have left over can be changed into euro at the Bank of Estonia at a fixed rate of 15.6466 kroon to \u20ac1.\n\n\nBanking and cards\nATMs and currency exchange offices (valuutavahetus) are widely available. You will get the best rates by exchanging only after arrival in Estonia. Avoid changing money in the airport or port as the rates are lower.\nCredit cards and debit cards are accepted most of the time, exception are limited with parking machines and rural farms. Contactless payment with credit cards and debit cards are supported by half of card terminals in use.\n\n\nTipping\nTipping has been common in Estonia only after the restoration of independence, and therefore isn't always requested. A 10% tip is usually added to the price in restaurants and taxi drivers often keep the change. Some restaurants and pubs have a jar or box on the counter labelled 'Tip' on it, where customers can put their change.\n\n\nCosts\nEstonia is overall much cheaper than Western Europe, but it is no longer the bargain it used to be in 1990s; in touristy areas (like Tallinn's Old Town), prices are comparable to those found in Germany and Scandinavia. It is still possible to spend less when you go off the beaten track.\nHere are some prices of regular goods: 1 kg of apples \u2013 \u20ac0.80, regional dish in a caf\u00e9 \u2013 \u20ac3-5, 30 km (19 mi) by bus \u2013 \u20ac2, hostel \u2013 \u20ac10+, local beer at the shop \u2013 \u20ac1.20. But when it comes to touristy places, suddenly prices sky-rocket: Rakvere Castle \u2013 \u20ac9, tour to National Park Lahemaa from Tallinn \u2013 \u20ac55, beer at a touristy bar \u2013 \u20ac3-4.5. Try to avoid this touristy ripoff \u2013 there is enough to see and do even without a big budget.\n\n\nEat\n\nEstonian food draws heavily from German, Russian and Nordic cuisine: traditional dishes are heavy meat-cabbage-and-potatoes fare, with lashings of dairy and fish.\nThe closest thing to a national dish is verivorst pig's blood sausage, similar to English black pudding and Finnish mustamakkara, a common winter dish particularly popular around Christmas.  It's always accompanied by lingonberry jam and often served with mulgikapsad, which is basically sauerkraut stew.\nMany types of food are similar to Russian dishes and have their equivalents almost exclusively in the former USSR, such as hapukoor, (lit. \"sour cream\", smetana in Russian), a sour 20%-fat milk dressing for salads, especially \nkartulisalat potato salad.\nAs Estonia used to be a food mass-production powerhouse in the times of the USSR, some of its foods, unknown to Westerners, are still well-recognized in the former Soviet Union. This is also true the other way around; in Estonian grocery stores products from countries of the former Soviet Union like Georgian mineral water are widely available.\nAmong other everyday food, some game products are offered in food stores in Estonia, mostly wild boar, elk sausages and deer. Some restaurants also offer bear meat.\nFor those with a sweet tooth, the national chocolate manufacturer is Kalev, with many specialist stores around the country as well as supermarkets retailing the product. The more adventurous may want to try kohuke, a flavoured milk-curd sweet covered with chocolate, available at every supermarket.\n\n\nDrink\n\nTap water is drinkable everywhere except where it says it isn\u2019t.\nEstonians know their alcohol.  Favorite tipples include the local beer Saku,  or A. Le Coq, the local vodka brands Viru Valge (Vironian White) and Saaremaa Vodka and the surprisingly smooth and tasty rum-like herbal liquor Vana Tallinn (Old Tallinn), famous in the countries of former USSR.  Public drinking is illegal.\nKali is the Estonian equivalent of the Russian kvass, a very mildly alcoholic (~1%) drink made from fermented brown bread.  Many locals also swear by keefir, a yogurt-like fermented milk drink similar to buttermilk.\n\n\nSleep\nThe number of hotels has exploded from a few to tens and hundreds after the reestablishment of Estonian independence. In 2004, Tallinn achieved first place among the Baltic Sea cities in the number of overnight stays in hotels, though still behind Stockholm and Helsinki in the number of total overnight stays.\nAs Soviet collective farms were disbanded, many farmers switched to running \"turismitalud\" or tourism farms, which are inexpensive and indispensable places for spending holidays in the nature, usually in a former farm house. Estonian Rural Tourism provides information on the tourism farms in Estonia. Hostels are another popular option for budget-sensitive travellers; see the website of the Estonian Youth Hostel Association.\nOften accommodations give a discount if you book with them directly (e.g. phone) instead of using one of the monopolistic online middle men. This is due to the reason that most accommodations in Estonia can be booked without credit card anyhow. So, there is no real guarantee that someone does turn up. Just that via phone owners are at least not stuck with an online fee without receiving the room rent.\nCamping is allowed virtually anywhere, except on private property. Some tourists have even camped in the city parks of Tartu because locals told them so. Otherwise, if you do not have a tent, some national parks (like Lahemaa) have observation towers with roof and space for up to 10 people at night.\n\n\nLearn\n\nEstonia has a fair amount of foreign students studying in its universities, especially from Nordic countries, as Estonian diplomas are recognized throughout the EU.  See the articles for university town Tartu and capital Tallinn for details.\nEducation is highly valued and taken very seriously in Estonia, and it is considered a key factor in the country's economic success. The Estonian educational system is often lauded as one of the best educational systems in the world. As a small nation without significant natural resources, Estonia recognises that its most valuable resource is its people and their knowledge.\nHowever, as a result of the high value placed on education, there is an oversupply of highly educated individuals in Estonia, which can create a challenge for the labour market. Many jobs that require minimal education are left unfilled due to the high number of qualified applicants seeking higher-level positions.\n\n\nWork\nNo obstacles exist to citizens of EU countries to come to invest and work in Estonia. Citizens of developed non-EU countries are exempt from short-term tourist visas. Swedes and Finns have by far the largest working community of post-Soviet foreigners in Estonia. Estonia may have had rocket-like growth from 2001 to 2008, but it was from a very low base as a former Soviet republic, and according to Statistics Estonia the average local monthly salary was around \u20ac1220 in 2017.\nConsiderable investments and some workers are constantly coming from CIS countries, though significant legal restrictions are imposed.\nPolice and Border Guard Board is the authority responsible for dealing with the paperwork.\nCV Keskus.ee is the most popular job portal in Estonia that holds the biggest number of job ads.\nCV Online is one of the oldest Estonian recruitment and HR services operating in 9 countries (as of 2005).\n\n\nStay safe\nEstonia has managed to avoid much of the crime and insecurity that has plagued many former Soviet Republics following the collapse of the USSR, and today it is among the safest European countries. Criminal activities are distributed unevenly across the territory with almost no crime in the island areas, modest petty crime in urban areas, and a considerable rate of drug dealing in the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial area of North-East.\nIn Tallinn, petty crime is a problem and there are some incidents involving tourists, mainly pickpocketing (especially in the markets). However, nowadays Tallinn's Old City and other main tourist attractions are closely watched by local police and private security companies.\nMany Estonians are careless, reckless drivers. The number of deaths in traffic related accidents per 100,000 people are similar to South-European countries like Portugal or Italy. Estonia has strict drink-driving laws with a policy of zero tolerance, but accidents involving intoxicated drivers are nevertheless a major problem. Estonian traffic laws requires headlights to be used at all times while driving and use of seat belts by all passengers is mandatory.\nEstonian law requires pedestrians to wear small reflectors, which people generally pin to their coats or handbags. Although this law is rarely enforced in cities, reflectors are very important in rural areas where it may be difficult for motorists to see pedestrians, especially in winter months. Violators of this law may be subject to a fine of around \u20ac30-50, or a higher fine up to around \u20ac400-500 if the pedestrian is under the influence of alcohol. Reflectors are inexpensive and you should be able to find them at many supermarkets, kiosks, and other shops.\nAs in many countries around the EU, the police are very effective at their jobs and they are not corrupt. Attempting to bribe the police may result in legal ramifications. \nThe main advice to anyone worried about personal security is to stay reasonably sober despite tempting alcohol prices. When driving, make sure you have had absolutely no alcohol beforehand.\nThe single emergency number 112 is valid all over Estonia for rescue and ambulance outcalls.\nIt has been mentioned that ordinary Estonians are unlikely to approach a complete stranger or a tourist on their own. If somebody suddenly turns to you in the street (with questions or matters of small business) keeping a cautious eye on your belongings would be wise. As it is a rather homogeneous country, Estonians may look intrigued if you are not white. With that said, racist acts are not common.\nPublic displays of affection between partners of the same gender may be met with stares, although violence is very unlikely.\n\n\nStay healthy\n\nFor an Estonian, it is considered mauvais ton not to criticize the Estonian healthcare system. EU studies have shown, however, that Estonia occupies a healthy 4th place in the block by the basic public health service indicators, on the same level as Sweden. Around 1998-2000, the Estonian healthcare system was remodelled from the obsolete USSR model, directed to coping with disastrous consequences of large-scale war and made more up-to-date by the experts from Sweden. Estonia has harmonized its rules on travellers' health insurance with EU requirements. Information about health care in Estonia is provided by the government agency Eesti Haigekassa.\nFor fast aid or rescue, dial 112.\nEstonia had Europe's second highest rate of adult HIV/AIDS infections, over 1.3% or 1 in 77 adults (2013), 28 adults per year 2019 . Generally, the rate is much higher in Russian-speaking regions like Narva or Sillam\u00e4e. Don't make the situation worse by not protecting yourself and others.\nTicks spread diseases like viral encephalitis and Lyme disease, which can be transmitted to humans, their season usually starts in April and lasts till October.\nBeware of poisonous plants like Sosnowsky's Hogweed and Giant Hogweed. Wear protective clothes and goggles. If burned, clean your skin with water and soap and protect it from the sun for at least 48 hours.\nTap water is usually drinkable, though some people prefer bottled water.\n\n\nRespect\nEstonians can be mistaken as somewhat unwelcoming at first. This is just a matter of culture; Estonians generally do not open up to people they don't know that well.\nAs in most places around the former USSR, smiling is traditionally reserved for friends; smile at a stranger and they will either think you're making fun of them and/or there's something wrong with their clothes or hairdo. Furthermore, an automatic Western smile is often regarded as insincere.\nEstonians tend to keep their physical distance. If there is a \"long time - no see\" situation, then a hug may be suitable. Standing too close to someone can make someone feel uncomfortable. \nA decent, quiet conversation is the Estonian way of doing business; a loud conversation is not. Don't be surprised if an Estonian takes time to formulate a response to whatever you've said; Estonians prefer to think before they act and they expect you to do the same. \nBe genuine and authentic; accountability and responsibility are pillars of Estonian culture. Don't say \"next time\" if there isn't going to be a \"next time\". \nEstonians tend to value their privacy and personal space, and they may not be as forthcoming or interested in discussing personal matters with strangers or acquaintances. This can sometimes be perceived as cold or distant, but it is simply a reflection of the cultural emphasis on privacy and personal boundaries.\nLike Lithuania and Latvia, Estonians are usually very proud of their nation and their country, and nationalism forms an important part of the country's identity.\nAfter decades of Soviet domination, there is still some resentment and distrust towards Russia and Russian people. The Soviet occupation of Estonia from 1940 to 1991 and the subsequent domination of Russian language and culture have left lasting scars on the country's national identity and cultural heritage. Even if you're the most ardent Russophile in the world, avoid being overly enthusiastic about Russia as it can very quickly arouse some strong emotions. Many Estonians feel that Russia has not done enough to acknowledge the harm that was done to Estonia and its people during Soviet rule. \nThe legal status of ethnic Russians in Estonia is a sensitive issue. Most ethnic Russians in Estonia are stateless permanent residents, and the Estonian government requires them to pass a test in the Estonian language to be eligible for citizenship. While many ethnic Russians regard this as discriminatory, the ethnic Estonian majority regards them as illegal immigrants who moved to Estonia under what they regard as the illegal Soviet occupation, and insists that the Estonian government is being exceedingly generous in allowing them to even remain in Estonia in the first place.\nA large amount (50\u201360%) of Estonians view their country as a Nordic country due to their close cultural and linguistic ties with Finland. The idea of Estonia as a Nordic country is not universally accepted, and there is debate and discussion around what exactly constitutes a Nordic country. Nonetheless, the concept of Estonia as a Nordic country has become more popular.  \nAs a small nation, its souvenir shops are often filled with characteristic items from neighbouring countries, for example with Russian matryoshka (nesting) dolls or Baltic amber. While both of them are popular among tourists, it is worthwhile to understand that neither of them have any historical or cultural connection with Estonia.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nInternet\nAccess to wireless, free internet is widespread in Tallinn and Tartu.\nOn the open road you will often find petrol stations which offer wireless internet access too\nIf you do not have a laptop, public libraries offer free computers\nThe number of internet cafes is dropping but you will find several open almost all night in Tallinn and Tartu (expect to pay around \u20ac2-3 per hour)\nMost hotels also have a computer with internet access available\nThe departure lounge at Tallinn airport has several free internet access points for passengers\n\n\nLandlines\nFor local calls, dial the 7 or 8 digit number given.  There is no \"0\" dialled before local numbers\nFor international calls from Estonia, dial \"00\" then the country code and number\nFor international calls to Estonia, dial \"00\" from most countries or consult your operator, the country code \"372\" and the 7 or 8 digit number\nFor emergencies and police dial \"112\"\n\n\nMobile phones\n\"Everyone\" has a mobile phone in Estonia\nTo ring Estonia from abroad, dial +372 before the number\nMobile access is available everywhere, even on the smaller islands and at sea\nPrepaid (pay-as-you-go) SIM cards and their top up cards can be bought from R-kiosks (ask for a \"k\u00f5nekaart\" - calling card in English). Popular brands are Super or Simpel on the Telia network, Zen on the Elisa network, or Smart/Tele2. Start-up packages are in a range of \u20ac1.55-10. 1GB is typically \u20ac1, cheaper in prepaid packages, but Tele2 goes even further by offering truly unlimited data for \u20ac20. Note that if you are continuing to another EU/EEA country after Estonia, all Estonian carriers have been exempted from \"roam at home\" and are thus allowed to charge extra for EU roaming. The only SIM with a surcharge-free roaming allowance in all of its data plans is Simpel. Super requires the Super X plan and charges by usage (\u20ac0.002 per MB per day capped at \u20ac1for 500MB), while Elisa/Zen and Tele2/Smart offer separate EU/EEA roaming add-ons (Elisa and Zen's EU/EEA roaming packages include the UK and Faroe Islands, which none of the other operators do).\n\n\nPostal service\nWithin Estonia, the postage cost for a letter up to 250 g (8.8 oz) is \u20ac0.65. You can send a letter in a convenient way electronically in the e-service also, in case you have ID-card or Mobile-ID or contract with a Bank (Swedbank, SEB, Danske or Nordea).\nTo other EU countries, Norway, Switzerland, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine the cost is \u20ac1.40 and to the rest of the world \u20ac1.50.\nBe sure to mark all air mail pieces with \"Prioritaire/Par Avion\" stickers available at the post office, or clearly print it on the mail if needed.\nStamps are sold at post offices usually open during normal shopping hours, and also at news stands.\nPost offices open on Saturday but for shorter hours than during the week, and are closed on Sundays; locations and opening hours of post offices and parcel machines.\n\n\nNewspapers\nPostimees\nEesti Prevalent\n\u00d5htuleht\n\u00c4rip\u00e4ev\nEesti Ekspress\nMaaleht\n\n\nRadio / TV\nETV\nETV2\nETV+\nVikerraadio\n\n\nGo next\none of the less-obvious destinations is having a day cruise to Stockholm or Helsinki, see Baltic Sea ferries.",
