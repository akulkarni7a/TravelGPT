  "extract": "Switzerland (German: Schweiz, French: Suisse, Italian: Svizzera, Romansch: Svizra), is a mountainous country known globally for its neutrality, democracy, and its almost-legendary affluence: Switzerland has one of the highest standards of living in the world, and prices to match.\nSwitzerland is known for its mountains (Alps in the south, Jura in the northwest) but it also has a central plateau of rolling hills, plains, and large lakes. The highest point is Dufourspitze at 4,634 m (15,203 ft) while Lake Maggiore is only 195 m (636 ft) above sea level, and the temperate climate varies greatly with altitude.\nSwitzerland is intrinsically more culturally diverse than perhaps any other European country. It has four national languages which have historically been dominant in various regions, or cantons. German, French and Italian are spoken in the regions bordering the respective country, and Romansch \u2014 a Romance language of Swiss origin \u2014 is spoken in the mountainous area of Graub\u00fcnden. \nSwitzerland also has one of the proportionally largest expat/immigrant populations \u2013 literally every fourth resident of the almost 8.5 million inhabitants is a foreign national \u2013 consisting of almost all of the world's nationalities and ethnic groups. \nSwitzerland can be a glorious whirlwind trip whether you've packed your hiking boots, snowboard, or just a good book and a pair of sunglasses.\n\n\nRegions\nPolitically, Switzerland is divided into 26 cantons, but the traveler will find the following regions more useful:\n\n\nCities\n1 Berne (Bern) \u2014 as close as the nation gets to having a capital, with an amazingly well-preserved old-town and arcades along almost every street; great restaurants and bars abound\n2 Basel \u2014 has an exceptional medieval centre, on the orthogonal bend of the river Rhine arriving from the east and leaving towards the north. Can also be used as a gateway to the Black Forest (Germany) and Alsace (France).\n3 Geneva (Gen\u00e8ve) \u2014 this centre of arts and culture is an international city home to around 200 governmental and non-governmental organisations, and is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web at CERN and the International Red Cross\n4 Interlaken \u2014 the outdoor and action sports capital of Switzerland, with everything from skydiving and bungee jumping, to hiking, white-water rafting, and canyoning\n5 Lausanne \u2014 scenery, dining, dancing, boating and the Swiss wine country are the draws\n6 Lucerne (Luzern) \u2014 main city of the central region with direct water links to all of the sites of early Swiss history\n7 Lugano \u2014 a gorgeous old-town on a pretty lake; much Italianat\u00e0 combined with Swiss seriousness\n8 Saint Gallen \u2014 main city of north-eastern Switzerland, renowned for the Abbey of St. Gall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it also functions as the gate to the very special Appenzell region\n9 Zurich (Z\u00fcrich) \u2014 Switzerland's largest city is a major centre of banking and culture, with numerous restaurants, a thriving nightlife, and a lakeside setting.\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Davos \u2014 large ski resort where the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum takes place\n2 Grindelwald \u2014 the classic resort at the foot of the Eiger\n3 Lavaux \u2014 a region of terraced vineyards on the shore of Lake Geneva and a UNESCO cultural heritage site\n4 St. Moritz \u2014 glitzy ski resort in the Engadine valley in south-eastern Switzerland\n5  Jungfrau-Aletsch \u2014 a protected area around the largest glaciated area in the Alps; this high Alpine park offers stunning views and is also a UNESCO natural heritage site\n6 Zermatt \u2014 famous mountain resort at the base of the mighty Matterhorn\nThe Swiss Alps stretch through the regions of the eastern part of Lake Geneva, Valais, Bernese Highlands, the southern part of Central Switzerland, almost the entirety of Ticino except for the most southern part, the southern part of Northeastern Switzerland, and Graub\u00fcnden.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nA landlocked country with an area of 41,285 km\u00b2, Switzerland is a land of picture-perfect Alpine ranges and verdant greenery. The country offers a range of old towns, diverse cultures and outdoor adventure-related activities.\nIt sits at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe. It has borders with France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Liechtenstein. \nIt is officially known as the Swiss Confederation in English. Its abbreviation \"CH\" comes from Latin, Confoederatio Helvetica, which is often used internally to avoid giving preference to any of the country's official languages. \n\n\nHistory\nSwitzerland has a history reaching far back into the Roman Empire times, when the tribes inhabiting it were called \"Helvetians\" by Roman sources. You can find many references to \"Helvetia\" or \"Helvetic\" in the naming of Swiss organisations and companies, and on postage stamps. A quarrel between Julius Caesar and the Helvetians is one of the first things to be described in detail in Caesar's De Bello Gallico, which is still read by Latin students all over the world.\nThe Helvetians and their successors have adopted various forms of democracy and devolution to govern their lands, rather than feudalism or autocracy prevalent in the rest of Europe, thus conserving and in a sense modernising Germanic traditions otherwise only found in the Nordic countries. Functioning as a (initially very loose) confederation for centuries, the country has grown to become one of the most diverse in Europe, while also vividly celebrating their national and local identity and the direct democracy employed to make a wide range of civic decisions. Swiss independence was a gradual process and for a long time the only document all cantons had signed was an alliance with France, but by 1648 after the Westphalian Peace, the Holy Roman Empire officially acknowledged that it had lost any right to sovereignty over the territory of the Swiss Confederacy (as well as that of the Dutch Republic), and Swiss fortunes started to diverge from those of other Alemannic states in southwestern Germany or Alsace. Swiss romantic nationalism of the 19th century would project a unity only really achieved after the 1848 Sonderbundskrieg backwards and mythologize the \"R\u00fctlischwur\" an oath of mutual aid supposedly sworn on the R\u00fctli meadow by representatives of the first three cantons: Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. While the exact date is not known, tradition associates it with a document from 1291 which supposedly documents this first act of Swiss unification. The tale of Wilhelm Tell (also converted into a stage play by German playwright Schiller) who rebelled against Habsburg overlordship is also dated to this era.\nSwitzerland's independence and neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers and Switzerland has not been involved in any international war since Napoleonic times and has been at peace internally since the 1850s. The political and economic integration of Europe over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international organizations has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its neighbours. However, the country did not become a UN member until 2002 and maintains a more or less neutral position in foreign relations. Unlike all of its neighbours (bar Liechtenstein), Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, but is strongly integrated with it, in particular by being part of the Schengen Area.\n\n\nClimate\nThe Swiss climate  is temperate, but varies significantly with altitude in the Alps \u2013 in average about 6.5\u00b0 C every 1000 m \u2013 and among the four major climatic regions : the northeastern and western parts of the Central Plateau, southern Switzerland, and within the Alps.\nThere are four clearly defined seasons which bring changes mainly in temperature and time of sunshine: rainy or snowy cold winters with short days from December till February, snow-melting and flower-blowing springs from March till May, moderately warm to sometimes hot, but also occasionally quite rainy summers with long days from June till August, and colourful and often quite dry, sometimes still astonishingly warm, but sometimes also already quite cold and foggy Autumns from September till November with days getting shorter and shorter. And each season or month can be quite different year by year .\nSwitzerland has cold, on the low Central Plateau often cloudy, rainy or snowy winters, and moderate to warm summers with very changeable weather which can change quite quickly, especially on hot summer days and in the mountains; in extreme cases within minutes. In some years you can experience cloudy, rainy, humid summer days, however on other days or even the next year very sunny, or sometimes even hot summer days with only occasional showers. Approximately every third day throughout the entire year is a rainy day with either a short shower, or constantly drizzling rain throughout the whole day. And a rainy period can endure from less than one hour to three weeks whatever season. Weather forecasts for more than six days ahead are scientifically fundamentally unreliable.\nThe most convenient and therefore the most visited months are from late May till early October with a particular, often overcrowded high from July to August. You can enjoy its fabulous landscapes either on a hike, a cruise, a train, or a bike ride. You will be able to discover the High Alps, its blacknose sheep, and glaciers. The summer season allows to combine the supposed incompatible, namely beach holidays on the lakes and some, though limited summer skiing. In winter, tourists and locals extensively enjoy many kinds of winter sport, and an enchanting Christmas atmosphere before, and a funny carneval season after the end of the year.\n\n\nDiversity\nSwitzerland showcases three of Europe's most distinct cultures. To the northeast is the clean and correct, 8-to-6-working, more stiff Swiss-German-speaking Switzerland; to the southwest you find the wine drinking and laissez-faire style known from the French; in the southeast, south of the Alps, the sun warms cappuccino-sippers loitering in Italian-style piazzas; and in the center: classic Swiss alphorns and mountain landscapes. Binding it all together is a distinct Swiss mentality. Switzerland is sometimes called a \"nation of choosing\" as the Swiss are one nation not because of ethnicity or language, but because they want to be a nation and want to be distinct from the Germans, Italians and French around them. Even though conflict sometimes arises between the different groups, the common Swiss identity is usually stronger than the dividing factors.\nWhile most of the cantons, save for the small Romansch-speaking regions, use languages in common with neighbouring countries, the language spoken there is not necessarily just the same as across the national border. In particular, Swiss German is very different from any of the variations of German spoken in Germany or Austria, with its own peculiar pronunciation and vocabulary. Even fluent speakers of standard German (Hochdeutsch) may have a hard time understanding the regular Swiss-German spoken on the street or in mass media. Fortunately for visitors, most German-speaking Swiss are perfectly capable of speaking Hochdeutsch, English, and at least one other national language (e.g. French). Even in its written form, Swiss Standard German differs notably from its German and Austrian counterparts, though most differences are minor and the one you are most likely to notice is the fact that Switzerland doesn't use the letter \"\u00df\", replacing it with \"ss\", which however doesn't affect pronunciation. Swiss French and Swiss Italian differ only lexically from their counterparts spoken in other countries. Romansch is, however, only spoken in remote Alpine communities, where most people speak at least one other Swiss language as well.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nSwitzerland is a peaceful, prosperous, and stable modern market economy with low unemployment, a highly skilled labour force, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most of the big European economies. The Swiss, long recognised for financial expertise, have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's to enhance their international competitiveness, and ensure smooth trade with their biggest trading partner, the EU. Switzerland remains a safe haven for investors, because it has maintained a degree of bank secrecy and has kept up the franc's long-term external value. Both of these have been called into question, as the Swiss franc has risen to almost parity with the euro due to being seen as a \"safe haven\" and the famous Swiss bank secrecy is more and more under attack from fiscal offices in America, Germany and elsewhere, with many high profile cases of tax evasion via Swiss banks ending up in court. Even so, unemployment has remained at less than half the EU average. This together with the exchange rate (especially to the euro) make Switzerland one of the priciest destinations in the world.\nSwitzerland is also known for its relatively low income tax rates, making it a popular tax haven for the world's richest people.\n\n\nPublic holidays\nPublic Holidays are regulated on a cantonal level (except for the First of August) and may vary greatly. However, these are the ones observed (almost) everywhere (excluding the ones always taking place on Sundays):\n\nNew Year's Day (1 January)\nGood Friday (2 days before Easter, not a public holiday in the cantons of Ticino and Valais)\nEaster Monday (1 day after Easter, legally not recognized holiday in Valais)\nAscension (39 days after Easter)\nWhit Monday (1 day after Pentecost, legally not recognized holiday in Valais)\nSwiss National Day (1 August)\nChristmas Day (25 December)\nSt Stephen's Day (26 December, not a public holiday in the cantons of Geneva, Jura, Valais, Vaud  and parts of the canton of Solothurn)\nGeneral Holidays observed by timetables by public transportation companies, in particular by SBB CFF FFS and PostBus, are: 1 and 2 January, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Ascension, Whit Monday, 1st August, 25 and 26 December. Business times of local offices and timetables of local transportation companies will sometimes also follow local holidays.\n\n\nPolitics\n\nSwitzerland has a federal system of government, and is divided into 26 cantons, with each canton having its own constitution, government and police force. The federal government is in its federal city, Bern.\nThe Federal Assembly serves as Switzerland's federal legislature, with each canton also having its own legislature. The Federal Council with its seven members is Switzerland's federal executive branch. Unlike other countries, Switzerland does not have a single person as head of state or head of government; rather, the entire Federal Council fulfills both roles collectively. The position of President of the Swiss Confederation rotates among the seven councillors on a yearly basis, with the year's vice president becoming next year's president. Apart from being the ceremonial chair of Federal Council meetings, though, he or she is a primus inter pares, having no power above and beyond the other six councillors.\nSwiss citizens normally vote four times a year on many different issues on each of three different political levels: federal, cantonal, and municipal. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times on federal only issues, to answer 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums). The populace can request any issue, including constitutional laws, or contradict any parliamentary decision. The most frequent themes are social issues (e.g. welfare, healthcare, and drug policy), public infrastructure (e.g. public transport and construction projects) and environmental issues (e.g. environmental and nature protection), economics, public finances (including taxes), immigration, asylum, and education, but also about culture and media, state systems, foreign affairs, and military issues \u2014 again on any of the three political levels! Perhaps not surprisingly for a country called to the polls so often, turnout is not always all that high by Central European standards.\nSome major instruments of this system known as popular rights include the right to submit a federal initiative (initiated by private people, public groups, or political parties) and raise constitutional or legislative referendums on any issue, both of which may overturn any parliamentary decisions. The results are always binding on the governments \u2014 \"The populace has the final decision!\" This gives Switzerland a very high degree of popular input on all political levels leading to some calling it \"the world's only direct democracy\". However, more than once an initiative which was later seen as an embarrassment even by some of those who voted for it was \"creatively interpreted\" or even outright revoked by a later referendum. There are some sub-national jurisdictions that have similar levels of \"popular legislation\" to Switzerland, and Switzerland, while not an EU member, is bound by many bilateral treaties with the EU, which are however subject to the same possibility of referendum as any other law.\nThe richness of Swiss democracy is also expressed in its many, more than thirty political parties, of which 12 parties delegate members to the two federal parliament chambers, the National Council and the Council of States, and the four largest parties collaboratively executing the seven-head Federal Council. Swiss politics has been free of Putsch (originally a Swiss-German word) and political violence since 1848 when the conservative-catholic cantons forming a \"Sonderbund\" lost a short civil war against the liberal majority. Since that time, there has been a tendency to make political decisions not by mere majority vote but by compromise. For example the composition of the federal government \u2014 for decades made up of the same parties \u2014 is determined by a \"magical formula\" which did not change from the 1950s to the early 21st century.\n\n\nTourist information\n My Switzerland website. (updated Feb 2024)\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Swiss-German phrasebook, German phrasebook, French phrasebook, Italian phrasebook, Romansh phrasebook\n\nSwitzerland has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansch. Many Swiss people are multilingual. \nGerman is spoken by almost two-thirds of the population and you can find a German speaker almost everywhere; it has official status in 21 cantons, making it the most useful language of the country's four official languages. Swiss German (Schweizerdeutsch), which is used in most formal and informal contexts, is not one language, but rather a group of Alemannic dialects spoken in Switzerland. Although picking up Swiss German is rather easy for speakers of German or another Germanic language, mastering Swiss German can be difficult. Some dialects of Swiss German \u2013 for example, Zurich German (Z\u00fcrit\u00fc\u00fctsch) \u2013 differ markedly from standard German so much that even native speakers of German have a hard time understanding them. If you don't know any of the local Swiss German dialects, do not worry: all Swiss-Germans learn Standard German in school and it is widely used in spheres such as commerce, media, government, and writing. \n\nFrench is spoken by almost a quarter of the population and you are likely to encounter a French speaker in Western Switzerland, Berne, or Valais. The language has official status in 7 cantons. Swiss French (fran\u00e7ais de Suisse) is similar to Standard French, although there are a few vocabulary differences. For instance, the Swiss French word for \"70\" is septante, not soixante-dix. Speakers of French should have no difficulties with speaking to French-speaking Swiss. \nItalian is the primary language of nearly 10% of the population and it has official status in 2 cantons: Ticino and Graubunden. Swiss Italian (italiano svizzero) is very similar to Standard Italian, although there are a few vocabulary differences. Speakers of Italian should have no difficulties with speaking to Italian-speaking Swiss. \nRomansh has official status in one canton: Graubunden. You're unlikely to come across a speaker of Romansh, as most Romansh people are also fluent in German and are outnumbered by native speakers of languages such as English, Portuguese, Albanian, and Serbo-Croatian.\nEnglish is widely spoken and studied in Swiss schools. The number of English-speakers in the country has grown since 2000. One national survey conducted in 2020 revealed that English is the primary language of nearly 6% of the population. English often serves as a \"lingua franca\" to communicate with people from different linguistic backgrounds. As a general rule, younger Swiss are more competent in the language than their seniors.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nEntry requirements\n\nSwitzerland is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\nSwitzerland is not a member of the EU, however. Therefore, travellers entering Switzerland from the EU are subject to customs controls even if there are no immigration controls, and persons travelling elsewhere in the Schengen Area will also have to clear customs. On the other hand, Switzerland maintains a customs union with Liechtenstein, and there are no customs controls when travelling between the two countries.\nAs a tourist: Personal goods worth a total of more than  Fr.5,000 and cash and all cash equivalents in excess of Fr. 10,000 have to be declared. Also some amounts of foodstuffs, alcohol and tobacco. The importation of animal products coming from countries other than EU states and Norway is prohibited. When you enter Switzerland, personal effects, travelling provisions and fuel in the tank of your vehicle are tax and duty-free. For other goods being carried, VAT and duty will be levied depending on their total value (over Fr. 300) and according to the quantity. Also take care if you want to travel with your pets. And generally comply with bans, restrictions and authorisations regarding protected species, plants, cash, foreign currency, securities, weapons, pyrotechnic articles (fireworks), narcotics and drugs, transfer of cultural property, product piracy, counterfeits, medicines (medicinal products) and doping, radar warning devices, and citizens' band radio (CB radio).\nUnaccompanied minors (travellers under the age of 18 years) are strongly advised to have a note of consent from their parents/guardian, as well as a copy of the parents' or guardian's valid passport or ID card. For more information, visit the FAQ section of the website of the State Secretariat for Migration (under the 'Border-crossing/Travel documents' heading).\n\n\nBy plane\n\nMajor international airports are in Zurich ZRH IATA, Geneva GVA IATA and Basel (for the Swiss part: BSL IATA) , with smaller airports in Lugano LUG IATA and Berne BRN IATA. Some airlines fly to Friedrichshafen, Germany which is just across Lake Constance (the Bodensee) from Romanshorn, not too far from Zurich.\nBasel airport is a peculiar case, as it also serves neighbouring Mulhouse and Freiburg and has three different IATA codes, as well as different customs procedure (and sometimes even airfares) depending on whether you fly to \"Basel\" or \"Mulhouse\". The airport also has an area code for the \"metro-area\" EAP IATA that should get you flights for both destinations.\nAlmost all major European airlines fly to at least one Swiss airport. The flag carrier of Switzerland is Swiss International Airlines, a member of Star Alliance and the Lufthansa Group. Together with their subsidiaries, charter/holiday airline Edelweiss Air, they offer connections to most major airports across Europe, as well as many intercontinental destinations.\nAdditionally, some smaller Swiss-based airlines also offer connections to Switzerland: Etihad Regional mainly from Geneva and Lugano, Helvetic Airways from Zurich and Berne.\nThe major European low-fare airlines, however, have very limited presence in Switzerland, usually offering a single flight from their home hub to either Zurich or Geneva. The exception is EasyJet, which has a dedicated subsidiary, EasyJet Switzerland, and offers flights to Basel, Geneva and Zurich within its usual low-fare business model. Ryanair flies to Basel.\nIn the winter season, many airlines specialising in charter and holiday flights offer connections to Swiss airports to cater to the skiing and winter sport markets.\nDepending on where you want to go to in Switzerland, it can make sense to fly to an alternative airport:\n\nTo the north: Friedrichshafen (FMM IATA), Memmingen (FMM IATA), Munich Airport (MUC IATA), Stuttgart (STR IATA), Strasbourg (SXB IATA) and Baden-Baden (FKB IATA)\nTo the west: Lyon (LYS IATA), Chamb\u00e9ry (CMF IATA) and Grenoble (GNB IATA)\nTo the south: Milan airports and Turin (TRN IATA)\nTo the east: Bolzano (BZO IATA) and Innsbruck (INN IATA)\nDue to the excellent train connections (see below) you might also conceivably fly into Frankfurt Airport (FRA IATA) and take the train from there.\n\n\nBy train\nSwitzerland boasts the world's densest public transportation system. The Swiss Travel System features a rail network of 29,000 km, including several popular rail lines. Trains arrive from all parts of Europe. Some major routes include:\n\nThe TGV Lyria (Train \u00e0 grande vitesse, French/Swiss high-speed railway connection), with several trains daily from/to Paris, Dijon, Lyon, Valence, Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille, Toulon, Cannes, Antibes, and Nice.\nExamples of travel time: Paris-Geneva 3 hr, -Lausanne 3\u00bd hr, -Basel 3 hr, -Bern 4 hr, -Zurich 4 hr;\nand Geneva-Lyon 2 hr, -Avignon 3 hr, -Marseille 3\u00bd hr, -Nice 6\u00bd hr;\nand Basel-Marseille 5 hr\nHourly EuroCity (EC) trains to/from Milan with connections to all parts of Italy.\nExamples of travel time: Milan-Bern 3 hr 12 min, -Basel 4 hr, -Geneva 4 hr, -Zurich 3 hr 36 min;\nonce a day: Milano Centrale-(Simplon Tunnel)-Brig 2 hr, -(L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel)-Spiez 2\u00bd hr, -Bern 3 hr 25 min, -Basel 4 hr 25 min,  -Freiburg i.B. 5 hr, -Karlsruhe 6 hr, -Mannheim 6 hr 45 min, -Frankfurt a.M.

(main railway station or airport) in Germany, many continuing toward Cologne and Dortmund, or Hannover and Hamburg, or Berlin, or Amsterdam.\nExamples of travel time: Frankfurt Airport-Basel 3 hr; Frankfurt a.M. Hbf-Berne 4 hr, -Interlaken 5 hr, -Zurich 4 hr, -Chur 5 hr 24 min;\nor Interlaken Ost-Bern 52 min, -Basel 2 hr, -Freiburg .i.B. 3 hr, -Frankfurt a.M. Hbf 5 hr, -Berlin Hbf 9\u00bd hr (twice a day)\n2-hourly IC trains between Zurich and Stuttgart, travel time 3 hr\nRegular EuroCity (EC) trains between Zurich and Munich, travel time 4 hr\nRegular RailJet (RJ) trains between Zurich and Innsbruck (3\u00bd hr), Salzburg (5\u00bd hr), Vienna (8 hr) in Austria, and further to the east\nSleeper trains operated by \u00d6BB under the brand name Night Jet\n\n\nBy bus\nFlixbus, which have all but cornered the German domestic market, also provide service to Switzerland as well as through Switzerland to neighboring countries. Flixbus is prohibited by law from carrying passengers domestically in Switzerland and you cannot book domestic routes with them or alight inside Switzerland when you board inside Switzerland.\nThere are several bus companies serving the Bosnian diaspora, which provide a cheap way of getting here from the Balkans. Turistik Pro\u0161i\u0107 runs from various destinations in the Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina to Switzerland.\n\n\nBy car\nAny Swiss city and many common tourist destinations within Switzerland are quite easily reachable by car, e.g. Geneva from central eastern France, and Zurich from southern Germany. However, some tourist destinations, especially some smaller, quintessentially Alpine villages such as Zermatt or Wengen are car-free.\nAlthough Switzerland is now part of the Schengen agreement, it is not part of the EU customs/tariff union. Therefore EU/Swiss border posts will focus on smuggling, etc., and checks on roads on or after the border stay in place. Delays are usually short but cars may be stopped and no reason needs to be given, even for searches inside Switzerland.\n\nSome delay may be caused by congestion at busy times and there are often queues lasting hours to use the tunnels under the Alps from Italy such as Mont Blanc, St. Gotthard etc. Swiss motorway vignettes (40 Swiss Francs) can and should be purchased at the border if your car does not already have a valid one for the current year and you intend to use the Swiss motorways which is almost unavoidable. Most cities do not have free parking; expect to spend Fr. 25-40 for a day's parking. Some cities are entirely off-limits to cars but easily reachable by public transport, so strongly consider arriving by train instead if your final destination is one of these places.\nWhen using mountain roads, bear in mind that they are also used by buses \u2013 most relevant on hairpin bends, which they will occupy entirely in order to get around. And most mountain roads are frequently used by the yellow Swiss PostAuto bus. If you see a postal bus, or hear it approaching a bend by its distinctive three tone horn, hold right back (before the bend!) and let it pass, they always have priority and their drivers count on your cooperative driving (see also mountain road hints)!\nFrom Italy: There are two main routes:\n\nDirection Zurich / Lucerne / Basel / Bern: A8 Milano-Chiasso, then A2 towards Gotthard\nDirection Lausanne / Geneva: A5 Aosta-San Bernardo Tunnel, then cantonal road to Martigny and A9 motorway\nThere is a third possibility that serves the Canton of Valais and passes from the A26 to Gravellona Toce, then along the Statale 33 and the Simplon Pass to Brig. The pass is always open and is a wide three-lane road. From Iselle there is a shuttle service with the train that takes you directly to Brig. \n\n\nBy tram\nThe Basel tramway system extends across the border into Germany (Weil am Rhein) as well as into France (Saint-Louis). The lines are popular with locals who shop across the border, and as Switzerland is not part of the EU customs area, there may be customs spot checks, so don't carry anything in excess of allowed imports. Similarly the Geneva tram system also extends into neighbouring France. There are plans for further cross border extensions of both tram networks, including a possible link to EuroAirport from Basel.\n\n\nGet around\nGetting around Switzerland is quick and easy albeit sometimes on the expensive side, no matter which mode you choose. The country has had a love affair with railways for over a century now, despite having been something of a late bloomer in railway construction. The few places not served by trains are served by the \"Postauto\" bus system and everything is seamlessly integrated, meaning you'll never have to wait long. Should you wish to drive a car, there are excellent highways throughout the country and many mountains are bypassed with tunnels. Hiking paths across the Alps have existed for centuries and are usually well blazed and maintained. Switzerland is also making an effort of marketing itself as bicycle friendly under the slogan \"Veloland Schweiz\".\n\n\nBy plane\nAs Switzerland has probably the most well-developed public transportation system in the world, and the country's airports are not that far apart anyway, there is very limited domestic air traffic. The connections offered by Swiss International Airlines and Etihad Regional include Zurich-Geneva, Zurich-Lugano and Geneva-Lugano. In most cases taking the train, sometimes combined with bus or other means, will be a cheaper option, and often it may prove just as fast and convenient as flying. If you arrive on an international flight to Flughafen Z\u00fcrich (in Kloten) or Gen\u00e8ve A\u00e9roport (in Cointrin), you may take a direct train or bus from stations integrated into the airport terminals. From there, easy connection with several means of transportation including only one or two swift transfers will bring you to many destinations\n\n\nPublic transport\nMain article: Rail travel in Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss will spoil you with fantastic transport \u2013 swift, disturbingly punctual trains, clean buses, and a half dozen different kinds of mountain transport systems, integrated into a coherent system. The discount options and variety of tickets can be bewildering, from half-fare cards to multi-day, multi-use tickets good for buses, boats, trains, and even bike rentals. In general there's at least one train or bus per hour on every route; on many routes trains and buses run every 30 or even 15 minutes. Inner-city transit often runs every 5-7 minutes during rush hour, but less frequently during weekends, particularly on Sundays and public holidays in more sparsely populated areas.\nAuthoritative information, routes, fares and schedules for almost all public transport can be found online on Swiss Federal Railway's (SBB CFF FFS) nation-wide coherently integrated timetable, or from posters and screens at any stop, or from a ticket window in any railway station. This timetable is also available as a free smart phone app. At any railway station of any provider you can get information and tickets (at manned ticket counters) for any of the many members of the railway network of Switzerland and most bus systems, in particular PostBus Switzerland which provides online timetable as well with the same data.\nBus and train are legally not allowed to compete each other in Switzerland, rather quite the opposite, they are complementary to each other \u2013 besides being coordinated timetable-wise. That way, almost all inhabited village and town in Switzerland can be reached by public transport. This is actually constitutionally demanded by the Public Service regulations of the Swiss Confederation; Public Service is a particular Swiss term loosely referring to all kinds of laws, acts, and ordinances, which define the basic supply of public services and infrastructure in particular concerning postal services, telecommunication, electronic media, public transport and road infrastructure.\nThere are about twenty regional fare networks throughout the country, which incorporate many kinds of public transport (city bus, tram, metro, any kind of train, PostBus, boats, funiculars and others) by many different providers around urban centers into one single fare system, such as ZVV in the canton of Zurich, or unireso  (see also: Geneva's tpg) in the canton of Geneva and its French adjacent area, or mobilis around Lausanne in the canton of Vaud at the northern shore of Lake Geneva, passepartout in the cantons of Lucerne, Nid- and Obwalden (keyword: Titlis). Usually these networks sell zone-based tickets valid for a particular time frame (instead of point-to-point tickets) for journeys within their fare network borders. Many of these networks and transit operators provide their own free smartphone apps; sometimes to be found at the major city's transit company website.\nEven if there is no train or city transit available, the comprehensive PostAuto/CarPostale/AutoPostale network gets you there. Where applicable, PostBus Switzerland is part of regional fare networks. You find all timetable information on SBB's online timetable, but PostBus Switzerland also provides their own free app with the same information as by SBB as well as many additional features.\nFurther information about the railway network in Switzerland and the Switzerland-wide countryside bus network is also available.\n\n\nHiking and cycling\n\n\nHiking\nAs good as the Swiss train system is, if you have a little time, and you only want to travel 1-320 km, you could try downloading the free swisstopo-App with the world's best footpath maps (paper copies can also be purchased) and walk 16-31 km a day over some of the most wonderful and clearly-marked paths, whether it is in a valley, through a forest, or over mountain passes. There are more than 60,000 km of well maintained and documented hiking trails and cycling routes.\nThe trails are well-planned (after a number of centuries, why not?), easy to follow, and the yellow trail signs are actually accurate in their estimate as to how far away the next hamlet, village, town or city is \u2014 usually given in terms of time, not distance. Once you've figured out how many kilometres per hour you walk (easy to determine after a day of hiking), you can adjust these estimates up and down for your speed.\nThere are plenty of places to sleep in a tent; but don't pitch one on a seemingly pleasant, flat piece of ground covered by straw \u2013 that's where the cows end up sleeping after a lazy day of eating, and they'll gnaw at your tent string supports and lean against your tent sides. And definitely don't do this during a rainstorm!, lots of huts on mountain tops, B&Bs on valley floors, or hotels in towns and cities. You could even send your luggage ahead to the next abode and travel very lightly, with the necessary water and Swiss chocolate!\n\n\nBy bicycle\nMain article: Cycling in Switzerland\nCycling is a popular, everyday means of transport in Switzerland. \nSince there is a network of straightforward cycling routes around Switzerland, it is a good place for cycling whether you're going cross-country or travelling around one of the cities. You can get information about cycling routes from Swiss Singletrail Maps and Veloland Schweiz.\nCycling in cities is safe and very common, and includes plenty of options like electric vehicles and free \"rentals\". If you decide to cycle in a city, understand that you will share the road with public transport. Beware of tram tracks which can get your wheel stuck and send you flying into traffic, and of course keep an eye out for the trams themselves and the buses, which make frequent stops in the rightmost lane and always have right of way.\nAccording to Swiss traffic law, a bicycle is considered as a road vehicle, therefore it is prohibited to cycle on sidewalks and foot paths, except for when explicitely indicated otherwise! As a bicycler you have to follow the same rules (and rights) as any other traffic member, such as cars and lorries. Therefore make sure you know the extensive Swiss traffic rules and traffic signs.\n\n\nInline skating\nBesides the main types of transport, the adventurous person can see Switzerland by in-line skating. There are three routes, measuring over a combined 600 km (350 mi) designed specifically for in-line skating throughout the country. They are the Rhine route, the Rhone route, and the Mittelland route. These are also scenic tours. Most of the routes are flat, with slight ascents and descents. The Mittelland route runs from Zurich airport to Neuenburg in the northwest; the Rhine route runs from Bad Ragaz to Schaffhausen in the northeastern section of the country. Finally, the Rhone route extends from Brig to Geneva. This is a great way to see both the countryside and cityscapes of this beautiful nation. Information about the routes can be found in the skating section of SwitzerlandMobility\n\n\nBy car\nMain article: Driving in Switzerland\nIf you like cars, Switzerland can seem like a bit of a tease. It offers some of the greatest driving roads in the world, but you can literally end up in jail for speeding, even on highways. Traffic rules are strictly enforced. If you stick to the road rules and especially the speed limits, the back roads/mountain roads will still be a blast to drive on, while making sure you are not fined or arrested. Driving can be a good way of seeing the country and the vista from some mountain roads makes it worth the cost and hassle.\nDriving on mountain roads requires special skill: be sure to read the in the \"mountain road tips\" in the Driving in Switzerland article.\n\nThe usual speed limits in Switzerland are 120 km/h (75 mph) on motorways, 100 km/h on expressways, 80 km/h (50 mph) on main roads outside towns and in tunnels, and 50 km/h (31 mph) limit in villages and towns. You may see different speed limits signposted, including 30 km/h (19 mph) and 20 km/h (12 mph) in built-up areas.\nMost drivers will need to buy a vignette, a sticker which costs Fr. 40 that allows you to use motorways and expressways as much as you like for the entire year.\nMotorists in Switzerland are required to switch on their headlights or daytime running lights at all times while driving or risk a Fr. 40 fine.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nThe seven wonders\n\nThe 1 Ch\u00e2teau Chillon : a castle near Montreux\nThe 2 Lavaux vineyards: on the shore of Lake Geneva\nThe 3 Castles of Bellinzona: in the southern canton of Ticino\nThe 4 Abbey of St. Gallen \nThe 5 Top of Europe and the Sphinx observatory : a \"village\" with a post office on the 3,500-metre-high Jungfraujoch above Wengen\nThe 6 Grande Dixence : a 285-metre-high dam, south of Sion\nThe 7 Landwasser viaduct : on the railway between Chur and St. Moritz\n\n\nThe seven natural wonders\n\nThe 8 Matterhorn: seen from Schwarzsee, the Gornergrat or simply from the village of Zermatt\nThe  northern walls of the Jungfrau and Eiger: two of the most celebrated mountains in the Alps, they can be seen from the valley of Lauterbrunnen or from one of the many surrounding summits that can be reached by train or cable car\nThe 9 Aletsch Glacier: the longest in Europe.

Mountain climbing from easy to very hard can also be found in Switzerland and there is hardly a place with a longer tradition for it. Some routes, like the North face of the Eiger (\"Eiger-Nordwand\" in German) have become near-mythical due to the hardships, sacrifice and even deaths suffered by the first people to climb them. And because of the breathtaking views, travelling from one place to another by car, bus, train or bike along Alpine roads and railroads is often an experience in itself.\nTour de Suisse is an on-road cycle race over nine days, regarded as a proving event for the Tour de France. The next is 12-19 July 2022 visiting Aesch, Quinto, Brunnen, Moosalp, Novazzano, Visp and Vaduz.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nSwitzerland's currency is the Swiss franc (or Franken, or franc, or franco, depending in which language area you are), denoted by the symbol \"Fr.\" or sometimes \"SFr.\" (ISO code: CHF) It is divided into 100 Rappen, centimes, or centesimi. However, some places \u2013 such as supermarkets, restaurants, tourist attraction ticket counters, hotels and the railways or ticket machines \u2013 accept euro bills (but no coins) and will give you change in Swiss francs or in euro if they have it in cash.\nSince Switzerland is surrounded on all sides by the eurozone and cross-border commuting is common, euros are also widely accepted and many price lists contain prices both in francs and in euros. Usually in such cases the exchange-rate is the same as or very close to official exchange-rates, but if it differs significantly you will be notified in advance. Money can be exchanged at all train stations and most banks throughout the country, and all ATMs accept foreign cards, so getting cash should not be a problem.\nSwitzerland is more cash-oriented than most other European countries, but credit card payments are common and you can easily travel for days without ever needing cash. If you do opt for cash, it is perfectly acceptable to use Fr. 200 and even Fr. 1000 banknotes.\nBanknotes are found in denominations of 10 (yellow), 20 (red), 50 (green), 100 (blue), 200 (brown), and 1000 francs (purple). They are all the same width.\n\n\tNinth series\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nAs of April 2021, only the ninth series banknotes (pictured above) are legal tender.  If you have older notes, they can be exchanged at face value at the Swiss National Bank head offices in Zurich and Berne as well as designated cantonal bank agencies in major cities.\nCoins are issued in denominations 5- (brass coloured), 10-, and 20-Rappen/centimes, \u00bd-, 1-, 2- and 5-francs (all silver coloured). One-Rappen/centime coins are no longer legal tender, but may be exchanged until 2027 for face value. Two-Rappen/centime coins have not been legal tender since the 1970s and are, consequently, worthless. Most exchange offices do not accept coins and the biggest coin (5 francs) is worth roughly about US$5 or \u20ac5, so spend them, give them to charity before leaving or keep them as a souvenir.\nQuite a few Swiss establishments will print your entire credit card number onto the receipt, raising identity theft concerns. Using your credit card you should check this and discard the receipts safely.\n\n\nBanking\nSwitzerland has been renowned for its banking sector since the Middle Ages. Due to its historical policy of banking secrecy and anonymity, Switzerland has long been a favourite place for many of the world's richest people to stash their assets, sometimes earned through questionable means. Although current banking secrecy laws are not as strict as they used to be, and anonymous bank accounts are no longer allowed, Switzerland remains one of the largest banking centres in Europe. Opening a bank account in Switzerland is straightforward, and there are no restrictions on foreigners owning Swiss bank accounts \u2013 except for US citizens. Since the latest sanctions by the US, many Swiss banks refuse to open a bank account to US citizens or anyone having connections to the US (e.g. US residents). In some cases, even existing accounts have been closed.\nThe largest banks in Switzerland are UBS and Credit Suisse (since June 2023 a brand of UBS).\n\n\nTipping\nSwiss service personnel enjoy a relatively highly set minimum wage compared to other countries, so tips are rather modest. By law, a service charge is included in the bill. Nevertheless, if you feel satisfied, especially in restaurants, you may round up the bill and add a few francs with a maximum of 5\u201320 francs depending on the kind of establishment, regardless of bill size. If you were not happy with the service, you needn't tip at all. If you just drink a coffee, it is common to round up the bill to the nearest franc, but some people are still quite generous. Tipping is always your personal contribution and never legally requested.\n\n\nCosts\nSwitzerland is an expensive country with prices comparable to Norway. Apart from soft drinks, electronics and car fuel, many things cost more than in the neighbouring countries, particularly groceries, souvenirs, train tickets and accommodation. In fact, many Swiss people living near the borders drive into neighbouring countries to purchase fuel and groceries, as it is usually significantly cheaper, a trend that has only increased with the franc soaring in exchange rate compared to the euro. Whilst there are no systematic immigration controls thanks to the Schengen agreement, there are random custom checks, even inside the country, since Switzerland is not part of EU Customs Union, so you must clear customs. Therefore make sure you comply with Swiss custom regulations for importing goods.\n\n\n\"Swiss-made\": souvenirs and luxury goods\n\nSwitzerland is famous for a few key goods: watches, chocolate, cheese, and Swiss Army knives.\n\nWatches \u2014 Switzerland is the watch-making capital of the world, and \"Swiss Made\" on a watch face has long been a mark of quality. While the French-speaking regions of Switzerland are usually associated with Swiss watchmakers (like Richard Mille, Rolex, Omega, and Patek Philippe), some fine watches are made in the Swiss-German-speaking region, such as IWC in Schaffhausen. Every large town will have quite a few horologists and jewellers with a vast selection of fancy watches displayed in their windows, ranging from the fashionable Swatch for Fr. 60 to the handmade chronometer with the huge price tag. For fun, try to spot the most expensive of these mechanical creations and the ones with the most \"bedazzle!\"\nChocolate \u2014 Switzerland may always have a rivalry with Belgium for the world's best chocolate, but there's no doubting that the Swiss variety is amazingly good. Switzerland is also home to the huge Nestl\u00e9 food company. If you have a fine palate (and a fat wallet) \u2013 you can find two of the finest Swiss chocolatiers in Zurich: Teuscher (try the champagne truffles) and Spr\u00fcngli. For the rest of us, even the generic grocery store brand chocolates in Switzerland still blow away the Hershey bars. For good value, try the Frey brand chocolates sold at Migros. If you want to try some real good and exclusive Swiss chocolate, go for the Pamaco chocolates, derived from the noble Criollo beans and accomplished through the original, complex process of refinement that requires 72 hours. These are quite expensive, though: a bar of 125 g (4 oz) costs about Fr. 8. For Lindt fans, it is possible to get them as cheaply as half the supermarket price by going to the Lindt factory store in Kilchberg (near Zurich). Factory visits are also possible at Frey near Aarau, L\u00e4derach in Bilten and Cailler in Broc.\n\nCheese \u2014 many regions of Switzerland have their own regional cheese speciality. Of these, the most well-known are Gruy\u00e8re and Emmentaler (what Americans know as \"Swiss cheese\"). Be sure to sample the wide variety of cheeses sold in markets, and of course try the cheese fondue! Fondue is basically melted cheese and is used as a dip with other food such as bread. The original mixture consists of half Vacherin cheese and half Gruy\u00e8re but many different combinations have been developed since. If you're hiking, you will often come across farms and village shops selling the local mountain cheese (German: Bergk\u00e4se) from the pastures you are walking across. These cheeses are often not sold elsewhere, so don't miss the chance to sample part of Switzerland's culinary heritage.\nSwiss Army knives \u2014 Switzerland is the official home of the Swiss Army knife. There are two brands: Victorinox and Wenger, but both brands are now manufactured by Victorinox since the Wenger business went bankrupt and Victorinox purchased it in 2005. Collectors agree Victorinox knives are superior in terms of design, quality, and functionality. The most popular Victorinox knife is the Swiss Champ which has 33 functions and costs about Fr. 78. Most tourists will purchase this knife. The \"biggest\" Victorinox knife is the Swiss Champ 1.6795.XAVT- This has 80 functions and is supplied in a case. This knife costs Fr. 364 and may be a collector's model in years to come. Most shops throughout Switzerland stock Victorinox knives, including some newsagents, and they make excellent gifts and souvenirs. Unlike the tourists' knife, the actual \"Swiss Army Knife\" is not red with a white cross, but gray with a small Swiss flag. The Swiss Army issue knife is also produced by Victorinox. It is distinguished by having the production year engraved on the base of the biggest blade, and no cork-screw because the Swiss soldier must not drink wine on duty. Swiss Army Knives cannot be carried on board commercial flights and must be packed in your hold baggage.\nSki and tourist areas will sell many other kinds of touristy items: cowbells, clothing embroidered with white Edelweiss flowers, and Heidi-related stuff. Swiss people love cows in all shapes and sizes, and you can find cow-related goods everywhere, from stuffed toy cows to fake cow-hide jackets. If you have a generous souvenir budget, look for fine traditional handcrafted items such as hand-carved wooden figures in Brienz, and lace and fine linens in St. Gallen. If you have really deep pockets, or just wish you did, be sure to shop on Zurich's famed Bahnhofstrasse, one of the most exclusive shopping streets in the world. If you're looking for hip shops and thrift stores, head for the Niederdorf or the Stauffacher areas of Zurich.\n\n\nEat\n\nWhile Switzerland has had long culinary exchange with the cuisine of its neighbours, it has several iconic dishes of its own.\nSwitzerland is famous for many kinds of cheese like Gruy\u00e8re, Emmentaler (known simply as \"Swiss cheese\" in the U.S.), and Appenzeller, just to name a very few of the about 450 kinds of cheese of Swiss origin. Two of the best known Swiss dishes, fondue and raclette, are cheese based. Fondue is a pot of melted cheese that you dip pieces of bread into using long forks. Usually fondue is not made of one single type of cheese, but instead two or three different cheeses are blended together with white wine, garlic and kirsch liqueur with regional variations. The most popular blend of cheese varieties is called moiti\u00e9-moiti\u00e9 and consists of equal parts Gruy\u00e8re AOP and Vacherin Fribourgeois AOP. Traditionally fondue is eaten during cold periods at altitude with one pot for the whole table, served with hot black tea and hardly any additional side dishes - not surprising, since it used to be a cheap and often the only dish for a herdsman high up in the mountains far away from civilization with only basic equipment. However you can now get fondue for one person during the summer time in tourist-oriented restaurants. Another cheese dish, raclette, is made by heating a large piece of cheese and scraping off the melted cheese, which is then eaten together with boiled potatoes and pickled vegetables. Cheese-lovers should also try \u00c4lplermakkaronen, Alpine herdsmen's macaroni with melted cheese and potato served with apple compote which is another very simple but very tasty dish originally from central Switzerland.\nAnother typically Swiss dish is R\u00f6sti, a potato dish quite similar to hash browns, but usually with some Emmentaler cheese added into the mix. Originally from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, it gives its name to the colloquial political term R\u00f6stigraben (lit.: R\u00f6sti ditch), which refers to the quite different political preferences and voting habits of the German-speaking and the French-speaking parts of Switzerland.\n\nProbably the best known meat dishes are the incredibly common sausage known as Cervelat, usually grilled on a stick over an open camp fire, and the speciality of region around Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrcher Geschnetzeltes (or in the local dialect: Z\u00fcri Gschn\u00e4tzlets), sliced veal in a mushroom sauce usually accompanied by R\u00f6sti. Very typical for Lucerne is the Luzerner Kugelpasteten (or in the local dialect: Loz\u00e4rner Ch\u00fcgelipastete), is Br\u00e4t (less expensive meat, minced, mixed with water and egg) formed as small balls, served in puff-pastry baskets, and poured with a ragout made of meat, agaricus mushrooms and raisins. In French-speaking Switzerland you will find the saucisse aux choux and saucisson vaudois and around Basel the liver dish Basler Leber(li) (or in the local dialect: Baasler L\u00e4\u00e4berli). Bern is known for the Berner Platte (lit.: Bernese Plate), a dish comprising various pork products, boiled potatoes, Sauerkraut (cabbage), and dried beans, besides others. This was traditionally an autumn dish, since the slaughter historically used to happen when weather was cold enough again to prevent any spoiling of the meat. The slaughter season and their dishes are called Metzgete in the German part of Switzerland and are still prominent on the menus of rural restaurants during this season.\nIf you instead prefer fish to meat, Swiss restaurants often serve the freshwater fish found in the many rivers and lakes. The most common fish dishes among the 55 kinds of Swiss fish include trout, European perch, or the whitefish known as (Blau-)Felchen, cor\u00e9gone/f\u00e9ra, or coregone blaufelchen respectively, cooked in a variety of ways. However, you will also find many imported fish on Swiss menus, since the domestic business (fished or bred) can never fulfill the strong demand for fish. Also, because the fish haul has become about a third smaller than 30 years ago, exclusively due to the much better quality of water nowadays; from this point of view, Swiss water is too clean!\nIn autumn, after hunting season, you will find many fabulous game and mushroom dishes. Many traditional game dishes come with Chn\u00f6pfli (lit.: diminutive of knobs; a soft egg noodle), red cabbage or Brussel sprouts, cooked pears and are topped with mountain cranberry jam. However, nowadays the game (venison, roe, chamois, boar, rabbit) mainly originates from farms in order to fulfill the high demand.\n\nThe mountain region of Graub\u00fcnden has a distinctive culinary repertoire, including capuns (rolls of Swiss chard filled with dough and other ingredients), pizokel dumplings, the rich and creamy barley soup Gerstensuppe, and a sweet dense nut pie called B\u00fcndner Nusstorte. Also from this region is a thinly-sliced cured meat known as B\u00fcndnerfleisch. Most mountain areas in Switzerland produce their own cured and air-dried meats and salamis which are highly recommended.\nThe canton of Appenzell in eastern Switzerland is known for various sausage dishes, including Appenzeller Siedwurst and Appenzeller Bauernsch\u00fcblig. Another favorite meat delicacy are Appenzeller Mostbr\u00f6ckli, a type of spiced, cured and smoked beef. The local cheese is branded as Appenzeller K\u00e4se and is supposedly made from a secret recipe. On the sweet end of the spectrum, Appenzeller B\u00e4rli-Biber is a soft gingerbread with an almond filling, and Landsgmendchrempfli is a sugar and egg based pastry filled with hazelnut paste.\n\nIt is very easy to come by high-quality Italian cuisine in Switzerland, but when in Italian-speaking Ticino be sure to try the local specialities based around polenta (a corn dish), risotto (the rice of the same name is exclusively cultivated in Ticino and northern Italy), and many kinds of marroni (chestnuts) dishes in autumn, either as part of a cooked meal, or simply roasted during very cold winter days in the streets, or as a special sweet dessert called vermicelles.\nSwiss chocolate is world famous and there is a large range of different chocolate brands.\nThe well-known breakfast dish M\u00fcesli, actually originally called  Bircherm\u00fcesli,  comes from Switzerland and is well worth trying \u2013 oats soaked in water, milk, or fruit juice and then mixed with yoghurt, fruits, nuts and apple shavings.\nOf course, there are many more local and traditional dishes and meals to be found, which can not all be listed. There is a whole site dedicated solely to the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland by canton, though it is only available in one of the official Swiss languages.\nLike most other things, eating out is expensive in Switzerland. One way to reduce food costs is to eat in the cafeterias of department stores such as Coop, Migros, and Manor. These cafeterias are usually considerably less expensive than stand-alone restaurants. Coop and Manor also offer beer and wine with meals while Migros does not. Smaller department store outlets might not have a cafeteria. Kebab shops and pizza restaurants abound in urban Switzerland, and these are often cheap options. In the major cities, more exotic fare is usually available - at a price.\n\n\nSupermarket chains\nSwiss employment law bans working on Sundays, so shops are closed. An exception is any business in a railway station, which is deemed to be serving travellers and so is exempt. If you want to find an open shop on a Sunday, go to the nearest big railway station. If a business is a family owned, hence small shops, such as bakeries namely, can also open on Sundays in most cantons.\nSwiss supermarkets can be hard to spot in big cities. They often have small entrances, but open out inside, or are in a basement, leaving the expensive street frontages for other shops. Look for the supermarket logos above entrances between other shops. Geneva is an exception and you usually don't have to go very far to find a Migros or Coop.\nThe most important supermarket brands are:\n\nMigros \u2014 This chain of supermarkets (a cooperative) provides average-to-good quality food and non-food products and homeware. However, they do not sell alcoholic beverages or cigarettes. Brand name products are rare as the chain does their own brands (quality is good). Migros stores can be spotted by a big, orange Helvetica letter \"M\" sign. The number of \"M\" letters indicates the size of the store and the different services available - \"M\" is usually a smaller grocery store, \"MM\" may be larger and sells other goods like clothing, and a \"MMM\" is a full department store with household goods and possibly electronics and sporting goods. Offers change weekly on Tuesdays.\nCoop \u2014 Also a cooperative. Emphasis on quality as well as multi-buy offers, points collection schemes and money off coupons. Sells many major brands. Come at the end of the day to get half-priced salads and sandwiches. Coop City is usually a department store with a Coop grocery store inside, a multi-floor layout provides space for clothing, electrical items, stationary, paperware as well as beauty products and perfume. Offers change weekly (some exceptions - fortnightly), on Tuesdays.\nDenner \u2014 A discount grocery store, noticeable for their red signs and store interiors. Relatively low priced. Offers change weekly, usually from Wednesday. Denner is owned by Migros.\nCoop Pronto \u2014 a convenience store branch of Coop, usually open late (at least 20:00) seven days a week. Usually has a petrol, filling-station forecourt.\nManor \u2014 the Manor department stores often have a grocery store on the underground level.\nGlobus \u2014 in the largest cities the Globus department stores have an upscale grocery store on the underground level.\nCoop offers a low-price-line (Coop Prix-Garantie) of various products, and in Migros you can find the corresponding \"M-Budget\" products. Sometimes it's exactly the same product, just for cheaper price. They also offer cheap prepaid mobiles some of the cheapest call rates.\nThe German discounters Aldi and Lidl are also present in Switzerland. The prices are a little lower than at the other supermarket chains, but still significantly higher than in Germany.\n\n\nDrink\n\nVirtually all tap water \u2013 including that in households or hotel rooms \u2013 is perfectly drinkable, thoroughly and frequently monitored, and of excellent quality. About 85% of Swiss residents drink tap water daily; there is no need to buy drinking water. There are many drinking water fountains to be found, especially in towns and villages, e.g. in Zurich more than 1200, or in Basel about 170. The few exceptions, such as in train toilets, are clearly signed with \"Kein Trinkwasser\" (German), \"Non potable\" (French), or \"Non potabile\" (Italian). Temporarily installed troughs on mountain meadows used to water the cattle are also not suitable for drinking.\nSoft drinks in supermarkets are one of the few things that aren't notably more expensive than elsewhere in Central Europe. Local specialties are the lactose-based soft drink Rivella and the lemon-flavoured Elmer Citro.\nThe drinking age for beer, wine and cider is 16, except in Ticino where the age is 18, while the age for any other alcohol (e.g. spirits, \"alcopops\", etc.) is 18. The public consumption of alcohol in Switzerland is legal, so do not be alarmed if you see a group of teenagers drinking a six-pack on public property or on public transport; this is by no means out of the ordinary and should not be interpreted as threatening.\nSwitzerland produces a surprisingly large amount of wine, with the climate and soil well-suited to many grape types. Very little of this wine is exported, and it is very reasonably priced in the supermarkets, so it is well worth trying! The Lake Geneva region is particularly famous for its wines, and the picturesque vineyards are worth visiting for their own right. However, wines are made throughout the country in Valais, Vaud, Ticino, Neuch\u00e2tel, the Lake Biel region, Graub\u00fcnden, Aargau, Thurgau, Schaffhausen and even on the hills around Zurich and Basel.\nBeer is also popular in Switzerland.  Mass-produced German-style lagers from Feldschl\u00f6sschen, Calanda and Cardinal are available throughout the country, but many locals prefer small, local breweries producing more interesting beers, and Brauerei-Kommpass (German only) is a good way to find these.\nKirsch is a clear, colorless and strong (typically 40-50% ABV) traditional Swiss liquor made by double-distilling cherries.  A relative of the German Schnapps, traditional kirsch is not sweet and in fact retains virtually no cherry taste.  It is typically drunk neat as a digestif after your meal.\nLast but not least, while absinthe is often thought of as a French drink, it actually originates from Neuch\u00e2tel and only liquors produced in the surrounding Val-de-Travers region are allowed to use the name.  Sickly green when poured, turning a milky white when water is added, this anise-flavored spirit flavored with wormwood is drunk with elaborate rituals involving slotted spoons and sugar cubes and was the favorite tipple of many artists including Vincent van Gogh.  Notorious for its reputed psychoactive properties, it was banned across Europe for years, but it became legal again in 2005, and K\u00fcbler Absinthe is the best-known local brand.\n\n\nSleep\n\nMost accommodation in Switzerland can now be found and booked through the major internet booking sites, even hotels and huts in remote areas. Even so, most tourist areas in Switzerland have a tourist office where you can call and have them book a hotel for you for a small fee. Each town usually has a comprehensive list of hotels on their web site, and it is often easier and cheaper to simply book directly with the hotel. Some hotels will request that you fax or email them your credit card information in order to secure a reservation. In general, hotel staff are helpful and competent, and speak English quite well.\nAs in most European countries, Switzerland offers a wide range of accommodation possibilities. These go from 5-star hotels to campgrounds, youth hostels or sleeping in the hay. Types of hotels in Switzerland include historic hotels, traditional hotels, inns located in the country, spas and bed and breakfasts.\nCompared to other European countries, accommodation in Switzerland is in general amongst the more expensive. Hotel rates in Switzerland can get quite expensive, especially in popular ski resort areas and major cities.\nThe following prices can be used as a rule of thumb:\n\n5-star-hotel: from Fr. 350 per person/night\n4-star-hotel: from Fr. 180 per person/night\n3-star-hotel: from Fr. 120 per person/night\n2-star-hotel: from Fr. 80 per person/night\nHostel: from Fr. 30 per person/night\nThe Swiss hotel stars are issued by the hotelleriesuisse Swiss Hotel Association. All members of hotelleriesuisse must undergo regular quality tests to obtain their hotel stars. On swisshotels.com you can find information on hotel stars, infrastructure and specialisations.\nTips are included with all services. For special efforts, a small tip, usually by rounding up the sum, is always welcome.\nThere is also a hostel network in Switzerland for students, the prices of Swiss Youth Hostels  are on the usual European level.\n\n\nLearn\nBear in mind that living costs are very high. The Swiss authorities expect that you are able to spend Fr. 21,000 per year, and usually require respective approval in order to accept a visa application. While this is a lot, you will still live a very moderate student's life with this amount only.\nSwitzerland has some universities of world renown, like ETH in Zurich, IHEID in Geneva, University of Lausanne or the University of St. Gallen (also known as the HSG). If you can't speak either French, German or Italian, take a language course first \u2014 many courses require a very good command of the local language. Although there are a few courses taught in English, particularly at the Masters level, Bachelor's degree courses are almost all taught in the local language. If you're a foreigner and you want to go for popular subjects, you may have to pass entry tests.\nIf you like cheaper learning, go to Migros Klubschule, who offer language courses in almost every language as well as a lot of different courses for many subjects. You may also want to try the different \"Volkshochschule\", which offer a large variety of subjects at very reasonable fees (such as the one in Z\u00fcrich).\nTo learn French in Switzerland, in addition to the above, ALPADIA Schools (formerly ESL Schools) and extensive network LSI] (Language Studies International) offer courses for adults and children.\n\n\nWork\nSwitzerland has long been regarded as a top destination for employment and career development. Foreign nationals make up a quarter of the population in Switzerland, and many of the world's most reputed companies and international organisations are based in the country. The Swiss government is keen to attract skilled immigrants and tackle staff shortages.\nAlthough all that sounds impressive, Swiss immigration laws are very strict and stress the importance of integration into Swiss society. You are expected to adhere to local laws and customs, demonstrate some involvement in the community, and work towards having a good knowledge of the official language(s) of the canton you're residing in. Swiss society tends to take a dim view of foreigners who don't try to integrate. Getting citizenship is hard.\nEU and EEA citizens have a legal right to work in Switzerland, and do not require any additional permits.\nGenerally speaking, it is difficult for a third country national \u2015 a citizen of a country that isn't a part of the EEA \u2015 to take up employment opportunities in Switzerland; a work permit will not be granted to them unless they can demonstrate that their background, skills, and professional experience can benefit the country's economic interests. Since Brexit, citizens of the United Kingdom are considered third country nationals. \nThe high level of Swiss salaries reflect the high costs of living; when you negotiate your salary, count on spending a lot on accommodation and food. In general, you nominally work 42 hours/week and have 4 weeks of paid holidays.\nSwitzerland has no general legal minimum salary. The salary depends on the industry you work in; e.g. the restaurant and hotel industry pays a minimum of Fr. 3134 gross for a full-time job (purchasing power parity US$2100, August 2016) per month. This is not far above the official poverty level. Overtime work is usually paid for low-level jobs, if not agreed otherwise in contract.\nSwiss employees are heavily organised in trade unions SGB and always keen to help you. Should you have a problem with your employer, the respective union is a good place to look for help. They can also be consulted beforehand, to check the average salaries by industry or make sure you get paid the right amount. \nIn February 2014, the Swiss people narrowly approved a referendum that requires the government to control immigration by use of quotas. Switzerland had previously made agreements with the European Union that allowed citizens of (almost all) EU states to work in the country. Following the referendum, Switzerland and the EU agreed to a scheme that allows for certain jobs in certain regions to be made available first to residents of the country, no matter whether they are Swiss or foreigners. Therefore little in practice has changed following the referendum.\n\n\nStay safe\nSwitzerland is one of the safest countries in the world as far as crime goes, but any place that attracts Rolex-wearing bankers and crowds of distracted tourists will also bring out a few pickpockets. Keep an eye on belongings, especially in the midst of summer crowds. Generally, you are safe anywhere at any time. If, for any reason, you feel threatened, seek a nearby restaurant or telephone booth. The emergency phone number in Switzerland is 112, and operators generally speak English.\nSwitzerland has a reputation for orderliness and adherence to rules. If you see a sign or if you encounter an authority figure telling you not to do something, it's in your best interest to comply. \nWomen travelling alone should have no serious problems. The younger Swiss tend to be very open with public displays of affection \u2013 sometimes too open, and some women may find people getting too friendly especially in the wee hours of the club and bar scene. Usually the international language of brush-offs or just walking away is enough.\nLGBT+ safety in public space is assumed, though explicit LGBT+ identifiers are not common outside of urban centres and dedicated spaces.\nSwiss police take on a relatively unobtrusive air; they prefer to remain behind the scenes as they consider their presence potentially threatening to the overall environment. Unlike some more highly policed countries, officers will rarely approach civilians to ask if they need help or merely mark their presence by patrolling. However, police are indeed serious about traffic violations. Jaywalking or crossing a red pedestrian light, for example, will be fined on the spot. The upside to stringent traffic rules is that car drivers are generally very well-disciplined, readily stopping for pedestrians at crossings. Football games are the only notable exception: due to the potential threat of hooligan violence, football games (especially in Basel or Zurich) are generally followed by a large contingent of police officers with riot gear, rubber bullets and tear gas.\nDo not attempt to bribe a Swiss police officer; bribery is an extremely serious offence that will land you in prison. Switzerland has a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption. \nSwitzerland has very strong Good Samaritan laws, making it a civic duty to help someone in need, although without unduly endangering oneself. People are therefore very willing and ready to help you if you appear to be in an emergency situation. The same applies to you if you witness anyone in danger. The refusal to help a person in need can be punishable by law as \"Verweigerung der Hilfeleistung\", i.e. refusal of aid. The general reservation of Americans to avoid entanglement with strangers due to possible future civil liability does not apply in Switzerland; it would be practically impossible to wage a civil suit against anyone providing aid.\nIn mountain areas, be sure to inquire about weather conditions at the tourist information office or local train station as you head out in the morning. They should be well-informed about severe weather conditions and will advise you about possible avalanche areas.\nThere have been problems with police assuming that any Black, East European or Arab person without an ID card or passport is an illegal immigrant, and treating them accordingly. That could be a considerable problem if you are travelling alone. Police have the legal right to ask you for your identification on any occasion, and, if you cannot show an ID card or passport, they are allowed to take you to the police station for identification purposes. So do as every Swiss does: have your ID card (or passport) with you, even though you are legally not obliged to.\n\n\nStay healthy\nGenerally there is no problem with food and water in Switzerland. Restaurants are controlled by strict rules. Water is drinkable everywhere, even out of every tap, especially so of public fountains, unless explicitly marked with \"Kein Trinkwasser\", \"Non potable\" or \"Non potabile\". Do not drink from temporarily installed trough on a meadow in order to water the cattle served by the close-by brook.\nThere are many organic food products available in virtually every grocery store, labelled as Bio, and it is illegal to import and sell any genetically modified food.\nSwitzerland has a dense network of hospitals and clinics, and public hospitals will admit you in an emergency. There are also some 24 hour \"permanence\" clinics at major railway stations including Zurich, Basel and Lucerne which can provide treatment for non-urgent illness without an appointment. Treatment costs may quickly mount up, so you will require a travel insurance with a good level of coverage if you cannot pay these fees out of pocket.\n\n\nRespect\n\nThe Swiss adhere to a robust set of values. They value and cherish cleanliness, integrity, world peace, organisation, and responsibility. \nCommunication styles vary from canton to canton, but generally speaking, the Swiss are comfortable with expressing their thoughts and ideas openly and clearly. German-speaking Swiss people tend to be more direct and formal than their French-speaking, Romansh-speaking, and Italian-speaking counterparts. \nThe Swiss are known for their privacy and the country has robust privacy laws. They are one of many reasons why many celebrities flock to Switzerland; their right to privacy is guaranteed.\nNosiness is not appreciated in Swiss culture. Do not ask a Swiss person about their background, personal convictions, or both unless you're well acquainted with them. Friendships and relationships are seen as serious affairs and the journey from acquaintanceship to friendship is often a long one.\nWhile Switzerland is brimming with dazzling, majestic sights, it is both impolite and illegal to record or take pictures of someone unless they have given you permission. Be mindful of where you point your camera, always. \nThe Swiss value transparency and clarity and they have little patience for words \"behind the lines\". To them, your word is your bond. Don't say something if you don't mean it. Don't make promises you will not keep. Try not to give evasive answers such as \"maybe\", \"later\", \"I'll see what I can do\", or variations thereof; this all demonstrates unreliability, which is frowned upon in Swiss culture. \nSunday is considered a \"rest day\" in Switzerland. On Sundays, many shops and businesses close down. Try not to be very noisy or disruptive. \nThe Swiss underscore the importance of rules, structure, and order. For instance, Swiss municipalities have designated quiet hours and Swiss condominiums often have detailed house rules (e.g. permitted noise levels) that must be meticulously followed. Showing respect to the community is something the Swiss value a lot, so try to follow suit. \nEnglish is widely spoken in Switzerland, but any attempt to speak the local language is appreciated, even if you are replied to in English. It is always polite to ask if they speak the language before starting a conversation in English. Make an effort to at least learn \"hello\", \"goodbye\", \"please\", and \"thank you\" in the language of the region you will be travelling in. \"I would like\u2026\" is also a phrase that will help you.\nGerman, French, and Italian all have formal and informal forms of the word you which change the conjugation of the verb you use, and sometimes phrases. For example, the informal phrase don't worry about it in French is ne t'en fais pas and the formal is ne vous en faites pas. The formal is used to show respect to someone who is considered to be a superior, or simply any non-acquaintance. The informal is used with children and close friends and relatives. As a general rule, you should not use the informal with someone you do not know well unless they ask you to, or you are talking to a small child.\nFriends kiss each other on the cheek three times \u2013 left, right, left \u2013 and it is a common custom when being introduced to someone in the French and German speaking parts. If it is a business related meeting, however, you just shake hands. Don't be shy \u2013 if you reject the advance it may appear awkward and rude on your part. You don't have to actually touch your lips to the skin after all, as a fake \"air\" kiss will do.\nLittering is seen as particularly anti-social. In some cantons, there are fines for littering (about Fr. 40 to 80), and there are plans to make littering generally illegal, including heftier fines. Make sure that you put your recyclable litter in the correctly labelled bin, as some have special containers for paper and PET plastic. Some municipal bins have restrictions on the times they should be used to avoid excess noise!\nBe punctual. That means no more than one minute late, if that! Unsurprisingly for a country that is known for making clocks, the Swiss have a near-obsession with being on time \u2013 the railway network even depends on a degree of punctuality some other countries would consider unachievable.\nGerman-speaking Swiss tend to have negative views of Germany and Germans. In Switzerland, Germans are seen as loud, arrogant, impatient, and unwilling to integrate into Swiss society. \nUse a polite circumlocution (for example, \"please\") when making a request; Swiss people consider it good manners.\nIt is disrespectful to assume a Swiss person's nationality based on their language or use terms that stereotype them. For example, do not call an Italian-speaking Swiss person an \"Italian\" or compare them to Italians in Italy.\n\n\nConnect\nMany of the internet cafes that have emerged in the 1990s have closed because Switzerland has one of the highest rates of high-speed internet connections in homes in the world, but there may be a few internet terminals in some large train stations. The tourist office should be able to direct you to the nearest one. The usual rate is Fr. 5 for 20 minutes. \nThe Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) are now offering free Wi-Fi in some of their stations (usually the bigger ones) but you will need to verify your identity by receiving an SMS on your phone, which will then authenticate you for 12 months. Some providers will not work but a local SIM card can be used instead. The access is for 60 minutes and resets every two hours. On long-range trains, there should either be Wi-Fi or an option to connect with an App called SBB FreeSurf, but it requires a data plan compatible only with some Swiss providers (inside trains, the 60 minutes restriction decays).\nAlso, you can send email, SMS (text messages to cell phones) or short text faxes from just about every public phone booth for less than one franc. Some public phone booths allow you to browse the internet. There are many shopping centers and cities (Lausanne and Vevey for example) that offer free wireless internet access: ask the young locals; maybe they know where to go. \nThe public phones are surprisingly cheap, and have no surcharge for credit cards. Some are even free to use (for example, in the city center in Z\u00fcrich)\nIf you stay for some time, it may be advisable to buy a pre-paid cell phone card that you can use in any phone that supports the GSM standard on the 900/1800 MHz bands - they usually cost around Fr. 10-40 and are obtainable in the shops of the mobile service providers Swisscom, Salt or Sunrise in most cities. Mobile network coverage is close to 100% by area, even in the mountainous, non-populated areas.\nThere are also a lot of cheap prepaid cards for local calls from other providers. The prepaid cards of the big supermarket chains Migros (M-Budget-Mobile) and Coop (Coop Mobile ) for example cost around Fr. 20 and include already Fr. 15 airtime. The cheapest prepaid card for calls within Switzerland is Aldi Mobile: Fr. 0.14/min Switzerland fixed and Aldi mobile, Fr. 0.34/min other mobiles. The cheapest prepaid card for international communication is Yallo: Fr. 0.39/min within Switzerland and to all European and many more countries (to the mobile and fixed networks). This includes the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. SMS cost Fr. 0.10. The prepaid cards can be bought online (30 Fr. with Fr. 30 airtime inclusive), in most post offices (Fr. 29 with Fr. 20 airtime inclusive) or Sunrise shops (Fr. 20 with Fr. 20 airtime inclusive). Another prepaid card with cheap rates offers Lebara Mobile (sister company of Sunrise). The prepaid card is available for Fr. 5 with an equivalent talk time and recharge vouchers offer the talktime equivalent to the price of the voucher.\nDue to a law introduced in 2018, a copy of an identity card/passport is required for buying or activating a local SIM card.",
