  "extract": "Saint-\u00c9milion is a small wine town located 35 km (22 mi) northeast of Bordeaux, between Libourne and Castillon-la-Bataille in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of Southwestern France. It is a medieval town in the Gironde department and stands magnificently on top of the hill overlooking the Dordogne valley. The town is an incredible open-air museum with a medieval atmosphere and has many bars, restaurants and wine shops to explore. The most surprising remains are probably its underground monuments: a unique monilithic church, and more than 70 hectares of underground excavations.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are flights to Bordeaux from other cities in France, and international flights from airports in Spain, Italy, Denmark, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Norway and Montreal, Canada.
