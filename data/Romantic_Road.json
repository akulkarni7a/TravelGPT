  "extract": "The Romantic Road (Romantische Stra\u00dfe in German) is a popular tourist route through historical towns in southern Germany, from W\u00fcrzburg to F\u00fcssen.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 W\u00fcrzburg \u2014 Most important sights are the Fortress Marienberg and the W\u00fcrzburg Residence.\n2 Rothenburg ob der Tauber, which is well known for its well-preserved medieval old town.\n3 Dinkelsb\u00fchl \u2014 St. George's Minster and St. Paul's\n4 N\u00f6rdlingen \u2014 surrounded by a wall, built in the 14th century, which follows the rim of the crater caused when a meteorite struck the earth 15 million years ago.\n5 Harburg \u2014  Harburg Castle, old town and old stone bridge over the river W\u00f6rnitz\n6 Donauw\u00f6rth \u2014  Liebfrauenm\u00fcnster church, Teutonic Order House, and the Reichsstra\u00dfe ensemble of bourgeois gabled houses.\n7 Augsburg \u2014 Town hall with the \"Der goldene Saal\"\n8 Halblech \u2014 Lovely little Bavarian Alpine village near Neuschwanstein, Germany's if not the world's most famous castle\n9 F\u00fcssen \u2014 A well-preserved old town and easy access to the castles of Schwangau, Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau\nThe towns of Dinkelsb\u00fchl, N\u00f6rdlingen and Rothenburg ob der Tauber are the only towns in Germany which still have a completely established city wall.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe term \"Romantic Road\" was first used in around the 1950s by travel agents in the American-occupied section of Germany. The name was known predominantly among American soldiers, who took their families on vacation there. The route is now popular with all nationalities, especially Americans and Japanese. Signs can nowadays even be seen in Chinese.\nThe places on the path show \"quintessentially German\" scenery and culture - however it also is quite touristy and may feel somewhat overrated to visitors looking for authenticity. As some say - \"it's like a minified Prague, but the number of people is the same\".\nWhile the whole route only passes through one federal state from north to south (Bayern or Bavaria) people in the northern part (W\u00fcrzburg, Rothenburg ob der Tauber) might consider themselves as Franconian rather than Bavarian and people in Augsburg might say they are from Schwaben (swabia) rather than Bavaria. Although getting this wrong shouldn't cause major offense, keep in mind that many Germans are prouder of their region than their country and don't want to be \"misidentified\".\nMore info can be obtained from the Touristik Arbeitsgemeinschaft Romantische Strasse, Waagg\u00e4sslein 1, D-91550 Dinkelsb\u00fchl, \u260f +49 9851 551387, (info@romantischestrasse.de).\nSome of the destinations on the road were part of the Grand Tour in early modern times.\n\n\nTalk\nGerman is spoken along the Romantic Road, though it may be strong on the Swabian dialect in the region around Donauw\u00f6rth.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe most logical major international airports to enter or exit the road are Frankfurt airport (direct ICE to W\u00fcrzburg) and Munich airport  (less frequent connections to F\u00fcssen). Nuremberg also has an airport with some international connections, although all are to Europe or Turkey.\n\n\nBy train\nWhile W\u00fcrzburg has excellent high-speed rail connections served by ICE, F\u00fcssen does not. Most intermediate towns along this road are surprisingly unconnected to major train routes, considering their touristic significance. A good deal for small groups or round trips is the \"Bayern-Ticket\" (\u20ac23 +\u20ac4 for any additional person up to five per group) valid from 09:00 to 03:00 of the following day valid on all regional trains (i.e. everything excluding ICE, IC or EC or to simplify: all red trains but none of the white trains) and many of the local transport systems (bus, streetcar, S-Bahn or U-Bahn)\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also: Intercity buses in Germany\nMany places along the Romantic road have long distance bus service at least daily. In addition to buses that mostly do the route itself, there are buses to places as far away as Berlin from e.g. Rothenburg ob der Tauber.\n\n\nBy organized tour\nOne of the preferred methods for many Japanese and American tourists, definitely cuts down on the stress while also limiting your possibility to \"explore\" on your own.\n\n\nGet around\n\nEuraide  operates along the Romantische Stra\u00dfe between April and October. \u20ac58.50 is the adult fare one way from W\u00fcrzburg to F\u00fcssen.\nThose with more time on their hands can travel at a more leisurely pace by bicycle along the 420-km stretch of road in about ten days. Guided tours are also available to take some of the stress out of the journey\u2014they will take care of your luggage and accommodation, and you can travel in their bus when it rains.\nMost of the destinations along the Romantic Road can also be reached by train.\n\n\nSee\nThe best-known places along the route are Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Baroque city of W\u00fcrzburg (a major wine region), F\u00fcssen (at the foot of the Alps), Augsburg, and the small but delightful town of Dinkelsb\u00fchl.\n\n\nDo\nWalk around the old town walls, visit the medieval torture museum and buy Christmas decorations in Rothenburg ob der Tauber.\nVisit the cathedral and sample wines in W\u00fcrzburg.\nVisit the Crater Museum near N\u00f6rdlingen. NASA trained here for the Apollo space program and as a gesture of gratitude actual rocks from the moon are on display here\nSee the fairy-tale castle of 1 Neuschwanstein  near F\u00fcssen.\n2 Harburg Castle \n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\nGerman beer. Try the Radler (beer mixed with lemonade) if you are cycling. Note, the limit for alcohol in your blood when you are driving a car is 0.05%, the limit for cyclists is 0.16% but is not enforced nearly as often).\nSample wine from the distinctive Bocksbeutel (a bottle whose name supposedly comes from being shaped like a ram's scrotum) in W\u00fcrzburg.\n\n\nStay safe\nObserve the road rules.\n\n\nGo next\nEscape to the Alps from F\u00fcssen",
