  "extract": "Brasilia (Portuguese: Bras\u00edlia), the capital of Brazil and the seat of government of the Distrito Federal, is a planned city in the Central Highlands of Brazil. Inaugurated in 1960, it is a masterpiece of modernist architecture listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and attracts architecture enthusiasts worldwide. Brasilia is also an important transportation hub for travel within Brazil.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe basic structure of Brasilia was completed in just four years, from 1956 to 1960, under the leadership of President Juscelino Kubitschek, with the slogan \"fifty years of progress in five\", and the city is in a sense a memorial to him. The cathedral has six columns representing two hands reaching up to almighty heaven.\nThe city is designed in the shape of a giant bird or airplane, with various separated zones assigned for specific functions such as housing, commerce, hospitals and banking. Running down the center of the \"airplane's\" fuselage is the thoroughfare called the Eixo Monumental (\"Monumental Axis\") and at one end lay the government buildings. The arched \"wings\" are residential zones, with several rows of medium-rise apartment blocks with small commercial districts. The intersection is the commercial and cultural hub, with stores, hotels, and the cathedral. A huge artificial lake serves the city as both a leisure area and to diminish the effects of low humidity in drier months (see Climate below).\nDecades after its creation, Brasilia is still developing a culture of its own. The city has often been criticized as a failed utopia where rationalized modernist planning has buried the human element. Yet Brazilians are quite proud of their capital, embodying a vision of a future when Brazil is no longer considered merely a \"developing\" country.\n\n\nOrientation and addresses\n\nGetting a grasp of Brasilia's addresses may be a little perplexing at first, as they are usually shortened to acronyms. Here are some useful tips:\nThe Monumental Axis divides the city into north and south sectors. Acronyms ended in N refer to sectors on the northern side, while those ended in S are on the south.\n\nSHS/SHN - Hotel sectors (Setor Hoteleiro)\nSCS/SCN - Commercial sectors (Setor Comercial)\nSQS/SQN - Residential sectors (Superquadras)\nCLS/CLN (or SCLS/SCLN) - Local commerce sectors (Com\u00e9rcio Local) along the wings.\nSES/SEN - Embassies sector (Setor de Embaixadas)\n\n\nClimate\n\nDue to its location, on a plateau at an altitude of 1,100 meters, temperatures in Bras\u00edlia seldom reach extremes during the year. 12\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C (63 to 82\u00b0F) are the average lows and highs, but it can get as low as 1\u00b0C (34\u00b0F) in winter and get as hot as 34\u00b0C (92\u00b0F) in September/October.\nIn Brasilia, there is two seasons: a rainy season, which runs from October to April, and a dry season, which runs from May to September.\nIn dry season (May\u2013September), rains are practically nonexistent. Between May and June, the relative humidity is around 50%. However, from the months of August and September, the peak of drought begins, with humidity below 20%. The city's landscape, normally very green, becomes desert-like and small forest fires can occur. At that time, it is common for locals to use a humidifier to minimize the effects of drought. If you visit Brasilia in the months of August and September, it is recommended to drink plenty of water to avoid the unpleasant effects of dehydration. Hot and dry air, along with dust, can cause burning eyes, dry skin, nose bleeds and difficulty breathing. On the other hand, during those months the city is blessed with a gorgeous sunset in spectacular shades of orange, pink and red.\nIn the rainy season (October-April), the rains gradually return in October and the lawns and trees turn green again. From November to January, the rains become more intense and with frequent thunderstorms. December is the rainiest month. In these months, flooding can occur in some parts of the city. Rains begin to decrease gradually from February to April.\nRegardless of the time of year, Bras\u00edlia has very high ultraviolet radiation. It is recommended to use sunscreen, especially during the late morning until late afternoon.\nBrasilia climate and weather information is available online at the National Institute of Meteorology (in Portuguese).\n\n\nTourist information\nOfficial tourist info can be obtained from State Secretariat of Tourism of the Distrito Federal   (in Portuguese).\nThere are also stands in the airport, the new rodoviaria and the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nDue to long distances and falling prices in air travel, flying has become a practical way of getting to Brasilia. The city is a national air travel hub, and there should be plenty of flights. In fact you may find your plane touching down at Brasilia airport even if you're not starting or ending anywhere near, such as Salvador to Bel\u00e9m. On the other hand, despite being a major international capital, getting in directly from abroad is difficult to impossible in most cases. Virtually all flights are domestic, and you will have to go through Brazilian customs and immigration elsewhere and re-board. There are non-stop flights from Lisbon (TAP Portugal), Lima (LATAM and Avianca), Bogot\u00e1 (Avianca), Miami (LATAM) and (American Airlines), Panam\u00e1 City (Copa Airlines), Montevideo (Pluna), Atlanta (Delta Air Lines) and Paris (Air France).\n\n1   Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (BSB  IATA) (11 km (6.8 mi) from the city center), \u260f +55 61 3364-9000, fax: +55 61 3364-9251. open M-F 11:00-16:00, departures area. Bras\u00edlia's airport has one of the few tourist information services in town (\u260f +55 61 3033 9488, from 07:30-22:30). It also has an exchange office at the arrivals area, another one at Banco do Brasil and several ATMs.   \nThere is an Executive Bus from airport to hotel zone and the central region for R$10.\nTaxis are another convenient means of getting from the airport into the city. They are relatively expensive for Brazilian standards for the 20-minute drive to the hotel zone. Regular buses number 102 and 102.1 are frequent and significantly cheaper. They link the airport to the main bus terminal at Rodovi\u00e1ria, from where you can catch buses or the subway to other parts of the city.\n\n\nBy bus\nDue to its central location, Brasilia is well served by a bus network that connects it with the rest of Brazil. Travel times are about 15 hours from S\u00e3o Paulo, 18 hours from Rio, 10 hours from Belo Horizonte and 3 hours from Goi\u00e2nia. Buses from other states arrive at a dedicated bus station called rodoferroviaria (\u260f +55 61 3363 4045), that is at the west end of the axis and is connected to the city center by bus (number 131, frequency each 10\u201320 minutes, from 05:00 to 00:00) and taxis.\n\n\nBy car\nDrivers coming from southern and Center-west states will arrive by the Sa\u00edda Sul entrance. From other states, you'll enter Brasilia by Sa\u00edda Norte. After you're inside the Federal District, keep following the Bras\u00edlia indicating traffic signs and Zona Central if you're staying at the hotel sector.\nThe Eixo Rodovi\u00e1rio Road, that crosses the city's south, central, and north sectors, can be identified by the characteristics double strip of yellow raised pavement markers (cat's eye) separating the two lanes of the road.\n\n\nGet around\n\nRent a car, ride the buses, take a cab, hitchhike, but whatever you do, don't plan on getting around Brasilia on foot. The city was designed under the assumption that every resident would own an automobile. Obviously things didn't turn out that way, and the city's public transport is a solution to an almost deliberately designed problem. Fortunately it works fairly well. Note that the roads have few crosswalks or traffic lights, so being a pedestrian also requires some caution and patience.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nNotable e-hailing services in the city are:\n\nUber\n99Taxi\nTeLevo (Brazilian service)\nIt's cheap and convenient.\n\n\nBy bus\nUse the app Moovit to find convenient connections.\nMost local buses start from or go through the rodovi\u00e1ria, at the precise center of the city, and run along the \"wings\" - serving the residential zones - or through the Monumental Axis.\nSome bus lines are very useful for moving around, as they link the central area of Brasilia (Setor Comercial, Setor de Divers\u00f5es etc.) to Esplanada dos Minist\u00e9rios, the airport and some of the main avenues (L2 and W3). These used to be stripped red-and-white buses called \"zebrinhas\" (little zebras) but now they are only distinguished from other bus lines by their numbers.\nUnlike many other Brazilian cities, passengers in Brasilia board buses by the front door. Buses must be flagged, otherwise they will only stop when a passenger requests to hop off.\nSingle fares are R$3.80-5.50 (Feb 2021) for travel within Bras\u00edlia. You can pay when you board the bus.\nIn January 2021 it worked to get a public transport card without a CPF. The card is prepaid. Within 3 hours you can use 3 means of public transport. For that you pay only R$5.50 (Feb 2021) altogether.\nYou can get the card at the BRB service center at the Rodoviaria Plano Piloto. Go downstairs in the direction of the Metro station Esta\u00e7io Central and then turn the next left. The BRB service center is at the end of the hallway.\nSemob Secretaria de Transporte e Mobilidade, the agency responsible for urban passenger transport in Bras\u00edlia, oversees bus operations ensuring efficient service across the city. For those looking to plan their journey, the DF no Ponto platform is the official tool for finding bus schedules and line itineraries. This platform offers detailed information on the various routes that traverse the city, making it a valuable resource for navigating Bras\u00edlia\u2019s extensive bus network.\nAdditionally, the website horariodeonibus.net is highly reliable and can provide an excellent experience for tourists and foreigners looking to travel around Bras\u00edlia. It complements the official platform by offering user-friendly access to bus times and routes, ensuring that all visitors have the information they need at their fingertips to explore the city conveniently and efficiently.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis usually cannot be hailed on the streets. Taxi stands, however, are close to all tourist attractions and any hotel will be able to call a cab or provide the phone number of the best known dispatch offices. All taxis must have taximeters and can start charging only after the passenger has boarded.\n\n\nBy subway\nThe Metr\u00f4 subway system's Y-shaped line starts in the main bus station (Rodovi\u00e1ria de Bras\u00edlia - \"Central\" station) and makes its first stop at Setor Comercial Sul (\"Galeria\" station), which is fairly near some hotels South of Monumental Axis. It runs along the south wing, stopping at blocks 102, 108, 112 and 114, then going through suburbs. The subway runs M-F 06:00-23:30 (some stations stop selling tickets at 22:30), and Sa Su holidays 07:00-19:00. There are different hours on some holidays, like New Year's Eve and the April 21st (city's anniversary).\nIt's not particularly useful for tourists, as it does not visit the main attractions but does stop at attractions such as the Buddhist Temple (EQS 115/116, access by \"114 Sul\" Station).\nBefore going on the subway remember to have pocket money in small bills or coins - the Metro doesn't accept credit cards and won't give change above R$20.\n\n\nBy car\nIf you are not using \"city tour\" services, it would be a good idea to have a car available. The urbanistic plan of Brasilia was highly based on individual motorized transportation, so it is not surprising that a visit to the city will be much more pleasing having a car.\nUnlike other Brazilian big cities, traffic in Brasilia is not a major problem, although there are some jams during rush hours.\nThere are public parking lots available at main sites, although it can be hard to find spots sometimes. As in other Brazilian towns, there usually are some \"watchers\", people that offers to watch your car (supposedly to protect it from robbers), expecting to get some money in return; they usually behave like beggars, although they can turn violent towards the cars if not paid, scratching or chipping the paint job, so it would avoid some trouble to just give a little money, something around R$2. If it bothers you, you can always park your car a little further from the main destinations, where there are no watchers, or in a paid garage, when available.\nAlso, drivers behave a little differently than in other places in Brazil:\n\nStop at pedestrian crossings - pedestrians will wave a hand before crossing or usually simply start walking. Keep an eye on the sidewalks at all times. Policemen enforce this rule and you can get fined if you disrespect it. Other cities are beginning to enforce this law as well.\nUse of horns - do not honk unless you really need to for safety reasons. Brasilienses hate it and really appreciate their driving to be as silent as possible.\nIt is paramount to have a detailed map in hand when driving through the city, especially in the central area. It is far more convenient to have a good GPS system, because the access of some streets can be confusing, as there are lots of elevated interchanges and ramps. Do not expect the signs to be clear and ubiquitous, there are no signs telling you on what avenue you are on and streets rarely intersect.  Smaller streets do not have names as they are defined by being between this and that square. This said, once you have understood the logic that rules ramps and intersections, theoretically you can throw your map away.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nCity center\n\n1 Three Powers Square (Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes) (at the eastern end of the Monumental Axis). Includes the seats of the country's 3 highest authorities: the Congress, the Presidential Palace (called Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto) and the Supreme Court. The axis itself is aligned such that on April 21 (Tiradentes Day, marking the death of the Brazilian independence martyr), the sun rises precisely between the two towers of Congress. The bronze statue of two abstract figures is named Os Candangos and represents the pioneering spirit of the workers who built the city. There's also a \"blind justice\" statue by the Supreme Court, a small museum about Juscelino Kubitschek, the Pantheon, the Eternal Flame monument, and a model, built to scale, of Brasilia itself, in an underground space.   \nThe fa\u00e7ade of the Palace of Justice has waterfalls that contrast with its stern geometrical beauty.\n2 Congresso Nacional, Pal\u00e1cio do Congresso Nacional - Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes, \u260f +55 61 3216-1771, visitas@camara.leg.br. 09:00-17:00.

With its 16 curved 90-ton concrete pillars and stained-glass panels, it is one of the world's most amazing modernist buildings.   \n5 Brasilia National Museum (Monumental axis. Near the Brasilia Cathedral). Brasilia's newest museum was built to be the city's home for renowned national and international exhibitions. As of 2012, the outside space has become a regular venue to free concerts and events, and very popular for skating, but its collections are temporary and severely lacking both in size and importance. However, give it a try, it's free.  \n\n6 Television Tower (in the middle of the Monumental axis). Tu-Su 08:00-20:00. This used to be the best place for a sweeping panorama of the city, until the opening of the new Digital Tower. It's the second best now.

A beautiful modern church built with concrete and blue stained glass. Bosco was a 19th-century Italian priest whose writings, some say, prophesied the creation of Brasilia. It's hard not to notice the huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the square church.  \n12 Little Church (Igrejinha), EQS 307/308. First one built inside Plano Piloto, was inaugurated in 1958 and looks somewhat like a nun's hat. Designed By Niemeyer and clad with Bulc\u00e3o tiles.  \n13 Universidade de Bras\u00edlia (UnB), big campus in North Wing. Very interesting modern architecture, from the 1960s until the 2010s. Its Olympic Center is by the lake; not much visited by tourists, but has some nice options for hiking/jogging/swimming.   \nCentro Cultural Banco do Brasil (CCBB) - SCES, Trecho 02, lote 22. Tel +55 61 33107087. Holds all kinds of exhibitions and cultural events. Russian paintings, musical concerts, documentaries, plays, thematic movie festivals, photography, you name it.

Pont\u00e3o has lakeside restaurants and a park while the Ermida Dom Bosco (near SHIS QI 29, bus line 100/123) chapel provides gorgeous views of the city from across the Lake, an excellent place to watch Brasilia's famous sunsets. You can swim in the lake at the Ecological Park next to the Ermida.   \n16 City Park (Parque da Cidade), South Wing. With 4.2 km\u00b2, it's slightly larger than New York City's Central Park. This wide green area is the city's hot spot for sports such as jogging, cycling, skating and even kart racing, as well as barbecues and other outdoor activities.  \n\n\nOutside the wings\n17 TV Digital Tower (Cerrado Flower), Colorado neighborhood. Newest TV tower that was inaugurated on April 21, 2012. Designed by Niemeyer, one of his last works. It's 180 m (590 ft) tall, from which 120 m are a concrete structure, and the rest the metallic structure of the TV antenna. Two glass observatories complete the structure. The highest one, 80 m above the floor, will contain a restaurant with a panoramic view. The other one will be used as an art gallery.   \nBrasilia National Park - Cerrado vegetation and fauna, plus natural swimming pools.\nPo\u00e7o Azul - A waterfall forming beautiful blue pools on a quartz rock.\n18 Ermida Dom Bosco (Next to QI 28 in Lago Sul).

Universo is well known for playing great games and drawing a big audience (for Brazilian standards). The season games happens in 'Clube da CEB' (CEB's club), at SGAS 904. If you want to play basketball, the city's park has plenty of courts available for public use. Your best chance to catch some locals playing is going on the weekends.\n Golf, \u260f +55 61 3224-2718. Brasilia Golf Club. SCES Trecho 2, lt 2. \nJogging - Brasilia's most popular sport by far. There are running tracks in the National Park and in the City's Park.

Expensive.\n\n\nBuy\nBrasilia's residential wings have many local shops such as groceries, drugstores, bakers, restaurants, hairdressers and so forth, and that is where townspeople do much of their daily shopping. The now somewhat decadent W3 avenue used to be the equivalent of a city's high street and still concentrates a large portion of the city's street commerce. Shopping malls, however, also play an important part when it comes to shopping in town.\n\nThe Setor de Divers\u00f5es is a fairly nice shopping area at the center of the city, very close to  Rodoviaria. The northern side, called Conjunto Nacional, is a bit more upscale, while the southern side has interesting small shops with books, music, and clothing that appeal to the local skateboard-riding youths. Notice that this southern side at night is very dangerous, being the favorite spot for hookers and drug dealers.\nOn Sundays there is a flea market at the base of the Television Tower.  Half of the stands are also open during the week and you can get local crafts and souvenirs hard to find in shopping malls.\nSome off-center places can also be of interest for travelers:\n\nThe imports market (popularly known as Feira do Paraguai) is the place to go for cheap electronics (cameras and replacement accessories, batteries etc.) and other travel items such as backpacks, flashlights and so forth. From Rodoviaria, take bus 124.2 (shorter trip) or bus 124.\nRecords and books - FNAC, at the Parkshopping mall has a good assortment of English-language travel guides and Brazilian music CDs. Livraria Cultura, at the Casa Park mall, has bilingual staff and an extensive collection of Brazilian CDs and foreign-language literature (especially in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German). Both malls are close to each other and can be easily reached by subway through the (almost self-explanatory named) Shopping station.\n Sebinho, CLN 406 Bloco C. A mid-range caf\u00e9, restaurant and bookstore known for its literary events and casual atmosphere in Asa Norte. (updated Aug 2017)\n1 Conjunto Nacional (Joint National Mall).   (updated Jul 2018)\n2 The ParkShopping.   (updated Jul 2018)\n\n\nEat\nBrasilia does not have a typical, regional cuisine. Nevertheless, restaurants serve food from many Brazilian states, as well as international fare.\nSelf-service (por quilo) restaurants are very common and usually cheaper than their \u00e0 la carte counterparts.\nMost of Brasilia's \"real\" (table service) restaurants are in the residential wings, usually a bus or taxi ride away from most tourist attractions. One of the most popular streets is the CLS 405 (from rodoviaria, take bus 114), with choices ranging from sushi to Brazilian, Mexican and French food.\nRegarding tips, visitors are expected to pay at least 10% of the bill. Such amount is commonly printed on the invoice and most of the time it's OK to include the tip in your credit/debit card since most of the restaurants share the total amount with all employees. Self-service restaurants usually don't charge tips.\n\n\nBudget\n\n\nMultiple locations\n Giraffas. Local chain with several locations around town. Rivals McDonalds in the fast food market by serving sandwiches and cheap beef/chicken + rice-and-beans set meals. (updated Aug 2022)\n Pizzaria Dom Bosco. The oldest active pizzeria in Brasilia.

Designed by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958, this hotel completes the Brasilia/Niemeyer experience. It was the first hotel in the city. In the 2000s, it was revamped maintaining the strict modernist 1960s style. \nAlways remember though, never show off any of your 'splurging'. Not only will this be considered as an insult to less fortunate citizens, you will be an advertising for a mugging.\n\n\nStay safe\nBrasilia is a safe city, but usual measures should be taken. At night, the area near the central bus station is not considered to be safe (prostitution and drugs). Avoid walking alone at night throughout the city.\nThere are an increasing number of cases of \"flash kidnap\". This consists of attacking people near or inside their own car, robbing and getting away with the car, and sometimes driving with the owner to make them withdraw money from automatic cash machines or even committing other kinds of violence. The local police give some advice  on how to avoid these crimes:\n\nTry to walk with company, avoiding deserted places or those with bad illumination. Be aware of people approaching to ask for information, especially during the night;\nWhen coming out of a bank, verify if you are being followed or if there are suspicious people near the vehicle;\nApproaching your car, have the keys ready, to make it easier to get into the car;\nGoing home (or to your hotel), do not park immediately. Watch the sides of the buildings and corners and only then stop the vehicle. Do not react to any kind of crime, as the criminals do not act alone.\nPolice officers are usually polite, but as they have to deal with considerable violence  they might appear harsh in situations when they have to be alert. Respect is the key for good interaction. In case of police intervention at a crime (i.e. when they withdraw their guns), lay down on the floor and put your hands on your head and don't make any subtle movement. Do not react if searched. Follow instructions and, as it is possible, inform someone of your situation by phone.\nTo get police assistance, dial 190 in any public or private phone. For medical emergency, dial 192.\nAlthough drug consumption does not lead to incarceration, it is still a crime in Brazil, and being caught with small amounts of illegal substances may lead to bureaucratic complications when leaving the country. Selling or transporting drugs for use of others is considered trafficking, a very serious crime, and will lead to severe consequences. So, do not use or carry drugs of any kind.\n\n\nConnect\nThe area code to Brasilia and region is 61 (also add Brazil's 55 if dialing from abroad). All 7-digit telephone numbers have been converted to 8-digit by adding a 3 before the number. To reach a number like 241-0000 from abroad, dial +55 61 3241-0000.\n\n\nBy web\nNeon Lights cybercafe, SRTVS, Patio Brasil mall - 2nd Floor, \u260f +55 61 3322-8060, webmaster@neonlights.com.br- inside a large shopping mall next to the South Hotel Sector.
