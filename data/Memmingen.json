  "extract": "Memmingen is a city of about 44,000 people (2019) in the German Federal State of Bavaria. The numerous courtyards, patricians' houses and fortification in its old town are well worth seeing. Due to its proximity to the Allg\u00e4u region it is also a popular base for tourists who are planning to visit the Bavarian Alps or Lake Constance. Memmingen is however mostly known by foreign travellers due to Allg\u00e4u Airport Memmingen being nearby.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nMemmingen is a small town with central functions in a rural area of Bavaria. Tourism was once widely limited to guests from places around. With the opening of the Allg\u00e4u Airport increasingly more international guests, discover the charm of the town for trips to the tourism regions around as well as to the popular destinations Ulm, Augsburg and Munich.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n\n1 Allg\u00e4u Airport Memmingen (FMM  IATA) (4 km east of Memmingen in the village of Memmingerberg). This minor international airport serves budget and leisure flights. Low-cost airlines sometimes sell it as \"Munich West\", which makes as much sense as calling it Stuttgart South or Z\u00fcrich North - it however can be an alternative to the often significantly more expensive Munich Airport due to its practical ground transportation connections. Ryanair and Wizz Air fly from over three dozen cities and leisure destinations with a focus on south-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean such as Alicante, Dublin, London-Stansted, Palma de Mallorca, Porto, Sofia, Tel Aviv, Belgrade, Pristina or Skopje, but also rather unusual destinations like Kutaisi. The airport is small so it can get congested, but is normally clean and spacious, with cafes, car hire and free WiFi available. The Starfighter F104 by the entrance recalls bygone days as a military airfield. It became a commercial airport in 2004 but stuttered for years without regular flights until Ryanair and Wizz established routes and has since expanded to serve nearly 2 million passengers per year.   (updated Dec 2022)\nBusses 2 and 810 shuttle daily approx. half-hourly between 05:00-23:00 from the terminal to the bus station (ZOB), which is next to Memmingen railway station and central in town. The ride takes 10-15 min and costs \u20ac3.50 (exact change preferred, card payment not always available) - with a railway ticket it may be included in the price, check when booking if the destination says \"Memmingerberg, Allg\u00e4u Airport\"; Bayern-Tickets are also valid on the busses. A taxi to town might be \u20ac15. From the station you can easily reach Munich (see below), or for that matter Stuttgart or Z\u00fcrich. There are multiple daily direct coach services (Allg\u00e4u Airport Express) from Memmingen Airport to Munich city centre as well which can be booked online or at a counter next to the arrivals area.\n\n\nBy train\nRegional trains operated by Deutsche Bahn (DB) and Go-Ahead run at least hourly from Munich (60-90 min, line RE96 being the fastest) and from Stuttgart via Ulm. Every two hours there are semi-high-speed long-distance trains (EuroCity-Express) from Z\u00fcrich via Winterthur, St Gallen and Bregenz and onwards to Munich as well.\nThe railway station is about a 5-minute walk away from the town center. There are luggage lockers next to the building. If all lockers are in use it is suggested to ask at the DB booking office for alternatives.\nRemember there are special train tickets for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg-Ticket) and Bavaria (Bayern-Ticket). With these ticket up to five people can use all regional trains for a whole day for \u20ac21 - 38 (all together). Both ticket types are valid for travelling to Memmingen. The Bayern-Ticket also covers the costs for the local public bus transport. More information about these tickets can be obtained from the Deutsche Bahn.\n\n2 Memmingen railway station (Bahnhof Memmingen).   (updated Jun 2021)\n\n\nBy car\nMemmingen is at the intersection of the A7 (Hamburg - Hanover - Ulm - Memmingen - F\u00fcssen) and A96 (to Austria and Munich) autobahns.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy foot\nThe town center is small enough to walk to all places of interest in the city. You can get a free map at the tourist office (\"Stadtinformation\") at the market square.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nGoing by bike is a fast way to get around in Memmingen. This way you get around independently from the rather poor public transport and moreover this way you might even visit some attractions in and around Memmingen which are not easy to reach by foot. Special signs for cyclists point the direction to regional bicycle routes. The Iller-Radweg is a long-distance route leading to Ulm in the north and to Oberstdorf in the south. The Kneipp-Radweg leads to the spas Bad Gr\u00f6nenbach and Bad W\u00f6rishofen. Bicycles can be hired at:\n\n Rad- und Rollercenter Heiss, Wernher-von-Braun-Str. 18, \u260f +49 8331 9255000. \n Memmingen Airport, \u260f +49 8331 9842000. \n Radl-Stadl, Unterdorfstr. 29 - 33, \u260f +49 8331 82537. E-bikes only. \n\n\nBy bus\nHowever, if you plan to visit nearby attractions out of town taking a bus  might be the right choice. The bus station is next to the train station. Tickets can be bought when entering the bus. Please check the return times in advance. After 19:00 there is no regular bus service but a so called \"Anrufsammeltaxi\" (hailed shared taxi), where a telephone notification in advance is necessary. Connections for public transport (within Bavaria) can be looked up at www.bayern-fahrplan.de.\n\n\nBy car\nIf you choose to discover the countryside around Memmingen, smaller villages in the Allg\u00e4u region or if you want to follow the tourist route \"Oberschw\u00e4bische Barockstra\u00dfe\" you may decide to hire a car. At the airport you will find the car hire agencies Sixt, Hertz and Europcar. Another car hire service by Europcar is near the train station. A local car hire service called \"Auto Greif\" is located at Colmarerstr. 34.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nMedieval old town\nThe medieval old town center consists of several attractions:\n\n Market place. This is one of the most picturesque sites in the town. It is surrounded by the town hall, the Gro\u00dfzunft(Guildhouse) and the Steuerhaus (tax house).

Former monastery.  \n\n\nMunicipal parks\nAround the old town walls where the moats used to be in the Middle Ages public park areas have been created. The moats have been filled up with exception of the \"hohe Wacht\" in the south of the old town and a part of the \"K\u00f6nigsgraben\" south of the \"Westertorplatz\". One of the parks is the Zollergarten a short walk north of the market place.\nIn the north outside the old town there is a wider-ranging park named \"Neue Welt\". Although it is a 10-minute walk away from the center it is a popular place for relaxation. A beer garden, Kneipp facility, volleyball field, streetball court and a skate park are a part of it.\n\n\nDo\nWalk along the tourist routes \"Roter Weg\" (red route) and \"Gr\u00fcner Weg\" (green route).
