  "extract": "A Coru\u00f1a (Spanish: La Coru\u00f1a) is the second most populous city in Galicia, and capital of its own province. It is home to a very busy port as well as the main industrial and administrative centre of the area.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nOrientation\nA Coru\u00f1a is located on a peninsula on the northwestern corner of Spain. Originally, it was just a tiny strip of land, but over time, sand and rock built up to form the area we see today. In A Coru\u00f1a, autumn and winter are usually unpredictable, with everything from overcast to snow. Summers are mostly sunny, and rain is rare. Spring is the most stable season in the city, with cool temperatures and calm weather.\nA Coru\u00f1a has a ring road that runs around the edge of the coast. The city is divided up into five parishes.\nA Coru\u00f1a is also known for its characteristic glazed window balconies, called galer\u00edas. These balconies were first designed as a naval solution for bad weather and rainy days. However, in the 18th century, workers at the Royal Dockyards had the idea of putting these balconies on modern buildings: and the fashion was born.\nMost of A Coru\u00f1a's historic sights can be found in its Old Town, or Cidade Vella. Notable buildings in the Old Town are the Royal Galician Academy, the churches of Santiago and Saint Mary, As B\u00e1rbaras Monastery, and the headquarters of the Operational Logistics Force of the Spanish Army. Each year in July, a Medieval Fair also takes place in the Old Town.\n\n\nClimate\nBeing exposed to Atlantic winds and low-pressure systems bringing plenty of rainfall for most of the year, it has the coolest summers of Spain's major urban areas, but likewise has very mild winters for its latitude.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 A Coru\u00f1a Airport (Alvedro airport LCG  IATA) (located in the Culleredo municipal limits, 8 km (5 mi) from A Coru\u00f1a). It has national and international connections and is used by Iberia, Vueling, Air Europa and TAP Air Portugal. There are some international connections (from London Heathrow, Amsterdam Schiphol, and Lisbon) and frequent national connections (mainly from Madrid and Barcelona, several flights a day, but also from Seville, Bilbao and the Canary Islands). You can get from the airport into town by local bus (departing every 30 min) or taxi.   \nThe (larger) airport of Santiago de Compostela (Labacolla) SCQ IATA is an alternative, 50 km (31 mi) from A Coru\u00f1a.\n\n1 Santiago de Compostela Airport (Santiago-Rosal\u00eda de Castro Airport, SCQ), Aeropuerto Avenue, 15820, Santiago de Compostela, \u260f +34 902 404 704. The 2nd busiest airport in northern Spain after Bilbao Airport   \n\n\nBy train\nSan Crist\u00f3bal is the city's main railway station. It receives long distance RENFE trains from destinations within Spain. Two railway lines terminate at this station. They begin in Le\u00f3n and Zamora and connect A Coru\u00f1a with central Spain. High-speed trains connect the city with Santiago de Compostela, Ourense-Empalme, Pontevedra and Vigo-Guixar. Regional lines also connect the city with Lugo, Monforte de Lemos and Ferrol. Intercity trains arrive from Madrid, Barcelona, and the Basque Country, passing through many other important northern Spanish cities.\n\n2 A Coru\u00f1a-San Crist\u00f3bal railway station, Av. Ferrocarril, 2.   (updated Jun 2021)\n\n\nBy bus\nThe bus station has numerous connections both international (operated mainly by ALSA) and local, operated by (among others) Arriva Noroeste, Autos Cal Pita or Monbus. Some local connections include the immediate metropolitan area (municipalities of Oleiros, Culleredo, Sada, Betanzos...), as well as most of the Costa da Morte area, Ferrol/R\u00edas Altas. There are relatively frequent connections with the Lugo coast (Ribadeo, Viveiro, Foz).\n\n\nGet around\nIf you want to go along the seafront promenade (paseo mar\u00edtimo), you can use the tram for \u20ac2, which will carry you from the football stadium (Riazor) to the other side of the city, near the town hall.\nTaxis are white in color. If they have a green light on the top, this shows they are available for hire. A ride from the centre within the city might cost you around \u20ac5-7, depending on the traffic.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nCidade Vella\nIn the Cidade Vella (old town), you can find (among others):\n\n1 Castelo de San Ant\u00f3n.
