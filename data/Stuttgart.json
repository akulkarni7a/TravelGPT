  "extract": "Stuttgart is known as a centre of mechanical and automobile engineering with the headquarters of the world-famous Bosch, Mercedes and Porsche within its metropolitan area. It does not, however, resemble most other industry hubs, as it is a rather sparse city spread over many hills and valleys, with forests, parks, mineral springs and even vineyards within the city. \n\n\nUnderstand\n\nStuttgart is the capital of the Bundesland of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany. With a population of approximately 632,000 in the immediate city (2017) and more than 5.2 million people in the metropolitan area (2013), Stuttgart is the 6th largest city in Germany. Stuttgart  forms the centre of Region Stuttgart, a densely populated and idustrialised area that is closely interwoven and shares the same public transport system consisting of 179 cities and municipalities with a rich history to discover.\nStuttgart consists of 23 districts (Stadtbezirke), which are further divided into 152 localities (Stadtteile). The five inner districts are named Mitte, Nord, Ost, S\u00fcd and West (\"centre\", \"North\", \"East\", \"South\" and \"West\", respectively). The outer districts are mostly former towns with their own names - of note are Zuffenhausen (Porsche headquarters and museum), Untert\u00fcrkheim (headquarters of Daimler-Benz and Mercedes-Welt, as well as sports arenas sponsored by Porsche and Mercedes), and Bad Cannstatt (nice old centre, mineral water and lots of vineyards).\nDespite being smaller and most densely populated among major German cities (when looking at the statistics), Stuttgart appears anything but that. This is because the population is not concentrated in the relatively small and hardly \"metropolitan\" centre, but is evenly spread over the hills contained within the city area, with multiple population centres stemming from the small towns that were incorporated into the present-day Stuttgart. Therefore, you will find many points of interest quite far away from each other, and the use of Stuttgart's very convenient public transport system quite necessary. Stuttgart is a big city with a small-town atmosphere.\n\n\nTalk\nIf you do speak German well: beware that some people still speak the local Schw\u00e4bisch dialect natively, which may somewhat affect their standard German. They love to practise other languages (especially English) and will try to help you. \n\n\n==Tourist information\nStuttgart Tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n\n1 Stuttgart Airport (STR  IATA), \u260f +49 711 948-0. The 6th busiest airport in Germany, reflecting the city's size and importance. It is on the southern outskirts of the city and connected via local rail (S-Bahn) and will eventually be connected to mainline high-speed railway.   \n\n\nAirlines and destinations\nThe airport is a base for Lufthansa's low-fare subsidiary Eurowings. Moreover, most major European carriers have connections to Stuttgart from their main hubs, so there is a wide choice of direct flights to other German and European cities, and even if there is no direct flight from your origin, you will easily find a connection through any of the hubs. Stuttgart has a direct connection to Atlanta.\nMoreover, Stuttgart's main railway station (Hauptbahnhof) is just an hour away by high-speed train (ICE) from Frankfurt Airport, which is one of Europe's major aviation hubs. Many airlines offer flights to Frankfurt with a connecting train to Stuttgart instead of direct flights to Stuttgart, and as this is very quick and convenient (landing you in the very city centre), you should consider this option as well.\nThere is a significant charter/holiday traffic between Stuttgart and the popular holiday destinations in southern Europe and North Africa, mostly served by dedicated carriers such as TUIfly. There is growing low-fare traffic to Stuttgart as well, with easyJet and Vueling all serving the airport from their bases across Europe.\n\n\nGround transportation\nThe best way to get from Stuttgart airport to the city centre is by using public transport which is clean, cheap and safe.\n\nThe S-Bahn line S2 or S3 will bring you in its red or gray vehicles to Stuttgart's centre (\u20ac3.70) within 27 minutes (see Timetable from station 'Flughafen' to station 'Hauptbahnhof'). Tickets can be purchased at vending machines at the level below the airport and above the platform (follow the symbol with a white S on a green background). Tickets should be validated at orange boxes on the platform before boarding the train. Alternatively, the VVS app can be used. The airport is not in Stuttgart, but in zone 2. You can use all public transport within the zones with this ticket.\nThe Stadtbahn line U6 will bring you to the airport from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof in 32 min. Its yellow and black vehicles are especially designed to climb up and down the steep hills of Stuttgart. All axles of the vehicles are driven. It manages a steep slope of up to 8.5% which is the steepest regular-lane friction track in Europe that is used in local public transport. The airport U-Bahn stop is located outside of the airport building right next to the M\u00f6venpick hotel (follow the symbol with a white U on a blue background).\nSeveral bus lines head for other destinations (e.g. T\u00fcbingen (828) and Reutlingen (X3)). For early flights during the week, the night bus N8 will bring you from Schlossplatz to the airport. The scheduled arrival at the airport is at 04:24. All buses will stop at the Stuttgart bus terminal (SAB) outside of the airport building just across the street.\nTaxis will be waiting at the airport. The airport's taxi service number is 0711/948 4409; Stuttgart's Taxi-Auto-Zentrale is 0711/55 10 000. Expect to pay around \u20ac30 to get to the city centre.\nIn the basement there are several car rental companies and outside at car park P4 there are parking lots reserved and used by ShareNow (Car2Go). If you only want to visit the city centre it is probably not the best option to rent a car.\n\n\nTerminals and orientation\nStuttgart Airport has four terminals (numbered 1 to 4), but Terminals 1 to 3 share a common airside \u2014 the number of the terminal indicates in which concourse the check-in and luggage drop-off is in the main hall (1 is the westernmost concourse area, the 3 is the eastern one and the 2 is between the main concourse). Terminal 4 is separate, although connected by a walkway on the landside (not on the airside, so you have to make sure you go through security there if you are flying from Terminal 4).\n\nTerminal 1 serves mainly Lufthansa and most other Star Alliance carriers (Austrian, SAS, Swiss, Turkish)\nTerminal 2 serves Vueling and KLM.\nTerminal 3 serves intercontinental flights (Delta, United), Eurowings, Aegean Airlines and other non Star-Alliance airlines, including Condor and Tuifly\nTerminal 4 is used mainly for charter and holiday flights\nDepartures are one level above arrivals and two levels above the S-Bahn station. See the airport's terminal guide for detailed floor plans.\n\n\nHotels\nThere is a Moevenpick and a Wyndham Hotel at the airport. For nearby hotels, some with shuttle service (for a fee) see Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt, B\u00f6blingen and Sindelfingen.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in Germany\n\n2 Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (city centre). Timetables for trains and booking are available on the webpages of Deutsche Bahn AG. Stuttgart main station is being redesigned (while still running) for the somewhat controversial \"Stuttgart 21\" project (see infobox). Once the project is completed Stuttgart main station will have transformed from a terminus to a through station with faster connections in most directions. Meanwhile, plan more time to reach the platform. For getting on from Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof and around in the city of Stuttgart, see Public Transportation below. Stuttgart is also served by  Flixtrain. They run one train each way daily on their Stuttgart-Berlin route. Trains have a lower top speed than the ICE and are thus a bit slower, but tickets are significantly cheaper. When booking via Flixbus, make sure to book a departure labeled \"train\" as you'll otherwise be sitting on a bus.   (updated Apr 2023)\n\n\nBy bus\nThe long-distance bus market has been exploding in Germany since 2013. There are dozens of daily services from most major cities, which are often significantly cheaper than trains. Most buses offer amenities like Wi-Fi and power outlets and some can even transport bicycles. The best resource for checking connections is this German website. As of 2018 there is no public central bus station and all of those listed below are well outside the city centre. While they are all connected to public transit, plan some extra time getting to/from your station and remember to figure in the price of the S-Bahn when comparing bus and train tickets. For intercity bus stops in Germany, the Stuttgart area is actually better than the often quite disappointing average in terms of facilities and modernity.\n\n3 ZOB Obert\u00fcrkheim, Hafenbahnstra\u00dfe 15 (S1).

Flixbus. Roadjet. (updated Sep 2021)\n7 Flixbus Stop Kornwestheim, Bahnhofstra\u00dfe 80, 70806 Kornwestheim (outside of Stuttgart). (updated Nov 2023)\n\n\nBy car\nStuttgart is among Germany's cities with most traffic jams, so try to avoid the rush-hour as car traffic can easily break down. Also parking is definitely a problem in most inner city areas. Expect a lack of parking facilities and high parking fees. Stuttgart is connected by the two major autobahns, the west/east-highway A8 to the south and the north/south-highway A81 to the west as well as smaller autobahn-like highways B10, B14, B27. However, Stuttgart has no motorway connection in the north east forcing commuters in this area to pass the city centre. Generally, follow the sign \"Stuttgart Zentrum\" to get to the centre of Stuttgart. Use park and ride facilities if possible. The most accessible are the park and ride facilities in Degerloch Albstra\u00dfe and \u00d6sterfeld. Stuttgart is low emission zone. Be sure that your car has the green sticker, but you are allowed to access those park and ride facilities with cars that do not meet the standards.\n\n\nGet around\n\n \n \nStuttgart has a very compact city centre with most destinations within walking distance. Nearly all visitors arrive at the main train station (Hauptbahnhof). From there the remarkable 1.2-km-long pedestrian shopping street called \u201cK\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe\u201d leads through the heart of the city, passing the Schlossplatz with the amazing New Palace, to the Roteb\u00fchlplatz (Stadtmitte). Other main sights (e.g. museums, opera) are just around the corner.\n\n\nBy public transport\nStuttgart's public transportation system comprises two light rail system - the Stadtbahn (or U-Bahn) and Schnellbahn (S-Bahn), as well as a city bus system. It is managed by VVS and is fully integrated in that there is one fare and ticketing system for all forms of transit, so that a single ticket can be used on any mixture of buses and trains that may be required to complete the journey. The VVS's network called is divided in zones. The city of Stuttgart is only Zone 1. Most lines will lead via Hauptbahnhof, ending in a layout that is pretty centralised: If you want to go somewhere, chances are, you have to ride via Hauptbahnhof. The following Stadtbahn or S-Bahn stations are in the heart of the city: Hauptbahnhof, Schlossplatz, Charlottenplatz, Stadtmitte (Roteb\u00fchlplatz), Feuersee, Rathaus, Staatsgalerie and Berliner Platz (Liederhalle). For a complete description see the official map of VVS-network.\nFrom Sunday to Wednesday public transportation stops around 01:00. On the weekend the S-Bahn is running hourly the whole night on all lines. So the inner city route from Hauptbahnhof to Schwabstra\u00dfe is connected frequently. Additionally there are several night buses running, all starting from the Schlossplatz. On Thursdays there are night buses at 01:20, 02:30, 03:40. Be careful if you have a very early airplane since there are no S-Bahn connections weekdays to the airport in the early morning between 01:00 and 05:00. The only option is a night bus from Schlossplatz. \n\n\nU-Bahn (Stadtbahn)\nStuttgart's Stadtbahn is a combination of suburban light rail, tramway/streetcar system and underground metro (subway). In the very centre of the city, the tracks run underground, and the overground sections run along city streets, partially grade-separated and partially integrated into city streets like tramways. That way, the yellow carriages of the Stadtbahn can travel all the way from the suburban hillsides to the central hub by the Hauptbahnhof, allowing convenient commuting with minimal changeovers.\nTo distinguish the Stadtbahn from the suburban trains of the Schnellbahn, it is referred to as  U-Bahn, and its lines numbered from U1 to U16. U-Bahn stands for underground/metro/subway in most other cities in German-speaking countries, even though in Stuttgart it runs underground over only a small portion of the network.\nMost of the U-Bahn lines go through the underground section in the city centre, stopping at either the Hauptbahnhof, Charlottenplatz or both - with the exception of line U3, U 8 and U13 which go to their destinations without crossing the city centre. See map for details. The numbers U11 and U19 are reserved for special lines only operating during major events in the Neckarpark. The U10 moniker is reserved for the Zahnradbahn (see below)., Since rebuilding the station Staatsgallerie is under way there are some temporary lines in effect. Check the map at your station for information about these temporary lines.\n\n\nS-Bahn (Schnellbahn)\nThe Schnellbahn (or  S-Bahn), literally meaning \"fast railway\", is a system of regional trains operated by the Deutsche Bahn for VVS. They run over mainline and railway track sections separate from the Stadtbahn, with fewer stops/stations and reaching farther beyond the city that the Stadtbahn. As the S-Bahn is separate from the U-Bahn, not all stations are integrated - there are S-Bahn stations with no connections to the U-Bahn system. That said, they are covered by the same ticket/fare system and compliment itself well.\nYou will most probably find the S-Bahn most convenient to use when covering larger distances or getting to locations not served by the U-Bahn, like the airport or Porsche Museum in Zuffenhausen. The S-Bahn lines are numbered from S1 to S6, plus the extra line S60.\nAll of the lines travel through the so-called Stammstrecke (common track) in the city centre, between the Schwabstra\u00dfe station and the Hauptbahnhof. From there, the lines extend in all directions towards the extremities of Stuttgart. Of particular interest are the S2 and S3, which extend to the Airport. Both go through the city centre to Bad Cannstatt and split in Waiblingen towards their separate termini. While the airport station (Flughafen) is the terminus for S3, the S2 continues to Filderstadt beyond the airport.\n\n\nZahnradbahn and Seilbahn\n\nThere are two fascinating transportations in Stuttgart, which are worth riding just because of the vehicle. The rack-railway (Zahnradbahn, commonly called Die Zacke) is the only urban rack-railway in Germany and comes with an amazing view over Stuttgart. It has 8 stations and runs between its termini:\n\n1 Stuttgart-Marienplatz. There is an underground stop of U1 and U9 at the Marienplatz next to the Zahnradbahn's overground terminus. \n2 Stuttgart-Degerloch. An U-Bahn stop is parallel to the Degerloch Zahnradbahn terminus, served by U5, U6, U8 and U12 \nThe historic cable-car (Standseilbahn) line connects Stuttgart-Heslach with the Waldfriedhof cemetery on the hill. It only has two stations - one downhill and one uphill:\n\n3 Standseilbahn Talstation (Lower station) (Heslach). (updated Aug 2021)\n4 Standseilbahn Bergstation (Upper station). \nBoth rack-railway and cable-car do not require a special ticket, instead all normal tickets valid in Zone 10 (including day tickets) are valid.\n\n\nTickets and fares\nSeveral ticket option are available (as of Dec 2018):\n\n3-Day-Ticket - if you are staying for more than a day, for added mobility buy a special \"3-Tage-Ticket\" for unlimited rides throughout Stuttgart. These are available in hotels, at the airport and the tourist information at the end of K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe near Hauptbahnhof - but make sure you take proof that you're a tourist (e.g. hotel booking confirmation). There are two types of 3-day tickets available. One covers the main Stuttgart city including Fellbach and Korntal (zone 1, \u20ac16.20), and the other is valid for the entire VVS network, including Ludwigsburg (\u20ac22.50) - you'll need this pricier one to access the airport.\nSingle Day Ticket - called EinzelTagesTicket, are also good value for visitors (1\u20132 zones: \u20ac5.20, 3\u20134 zones: \u20ac8.60, entire network: \u20ac13.20) They allow as many journeys until the end of day.\nGroup Day Tickets - GruppenTagesTickets for up to 5 persons (1\u20132 zones: \u20ac12.30, 3\u20134 zones: \u20ac17.10. entire network: \u20ac19.90).\nSingle Ticket - A Single Ride Ticket entitles the rider to one ride in the same direction, but changing lines as well as ride interruptions are permitted. The tickets remain in effect for two hours from purchase (1 zone: \u20ac2.50, 2 zones: \u20ac2.90, 3 zones: 4.20....)\nStuttCard - provides free access to museums and a number discounts on purchase, can be combined with a 1-, 2- or 3-day travel pass.\nIn the Stadtbahn and the buses stamping machines are available inside the cars, while on the S-Bahn they are at the entrances of the stations and there is no possibility to stamp once you are in the train. (If you do forget to stamp your ticket in the S-Bahn, either get out at the next station, stamp and wait for the following train, or write the current time and location on the stamping field with a non-erasable pencil \u2013 this will also be accepted by the inspectors most of the time.)\nFare-dodging is severely frowned upon and plain-clothes inspectors are on constant patrol. Fines are steep, starting at \u20ac60 per person for the first offense.\n\n\nBy car\n\nIf you intend to drive by car inside Stuttgart, the only possibility to park are parking blocks at about \u20ac1.50 per hour. Some parking blocks are closed during late night, providing no way of getting your car out. The street layout and numerous tunnels in Stuttgart can be confusing for tourists. Driving by car is not recommended.\n\n\nBy e-hailing\nUber and Free Now cover the city.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis are expensive. For \u20ac10 you will get about 4 minutes of a taxi drive. With two or more people, getting a taxi together at night (when public transportation has stopped) can make sense. Call a taxi in Stuttgart: Phone Nr. 0711/55 10 000 - Taxi-Auto-Zentrale Stuttgart. There is a special offer for women travelling at night for more safety. If you are a woman or a group of only women travelling after 20:00, you can request a Frauen-Nacht-Taxi, which will have a female driver and the costs are reduced by \u20ac5. The Uber app can also be used in Stuttgart.\n\n\nSee\nStuttgart, which once had a reputation as the conservative capital of the south-west, has turned into a bustling metropolis with world-class culture, great shopping and night-life. The capital\u2019s architecture is an appealing mixture of historical and modern buildings with green parks and even vineyards throughout the city. The unique cauldron-shaped landscape offers plenty of scenic lookouts and formed a dense city centre where nowadays fortunately most of Stuttgart's main attractions are. In the heart of the city centre the Palace Square is a must for visitors and an ideal starting point for a tour.\n\n\nCity Centre\n\n1 Schlossplatz (Palace Square). The Schlossplatz is the largest square in Stuttgart, right in the middle of the Mitte in front of the Neues Schloss. It was created as parade grounds for the palace, and is now a public green area with lawns, flowerbeds, twin fountains and a decorative bandstand. It immediately adjoins the Koenigstra\u00dfe, and a number of key buildings can be accessed immediately from it. In warmer months, the Schlossplatz is always full of locals, students and tourists enjoying its relaxing atmosphere. It is also an event location.   (updated Aug 2021)\n2 Neues Schloss (New Palace). The arguably most recognizable symbol of Stuttgart was constructed between 1746 and 1807 when the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, Carl Eugen, found the Altes Schloss and the erstwhile ducal residence in Ludwigsburg to be insufficiently stately. The new palace was a grandiose undertaking that took many decades, architects and four successive Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg to complete, given the ever-changing tastes and plans, as well as constant scandalization within the Duchy regarding the costs of the lavish residence.The result is a palace inspired partially by Versailles and other grand royal residences, which gave the centre of Stuttgart an airy, garden park feel. The palace became a state museum in 1918 when the last King of W\u00fcrttemberg abdicated, and was almost completely destroyed in World War II. It was rebuilt in 1958-1964 to serve as a seat for the local government of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It now houses the Ministry of Finance and Economy for the Land, and can be visited during guided tours. Tour dates are announced in advance on the palace's website, and visitors are invited to sign up. Several rooms and halls in the palace can also be rented for special events. Tours cost \u20ac8 per adult.   \n\n3 Altes Schloss (Old Castle). Built as a fully-functional fortified castle at the turn of the 10th century, it grew together with Stuttgart as it rose from a small settlement to the capital of County, and later Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg. It was in the 16th century that the castle got its current form of a renaissance palace with a cloistered courtyard. The moat around the Altes Schloss was filled in in the 18th century, and became today's Schillerplatz. Today the Altes Schloss houses the Landemuseum W\u00fcrttemberg.   \n4 Alte Kanzlei (Old Chancellery). The construction of the mighty monument on the northeast side of the Schiller Square lasted three years from 1542 to 1544. Only 22 years later, in 1566, the construction of the building has been extended. Nowadays the Old Chancellery would be comparable to the function of a town hall. Today the building is used as a restaurant and a bar.   \n5 K\u00f6nigsbau. The K\u00f6nigsbau was erected 1856-1860 directly in front of the Neues Schloss as a multi-functional building to host commerce and special events, at the order of King Wilhem I (hence the name, which means \"king's building\"). Its Schlossplatz facade, with 34 columns over 135 metres, serves as a balance to the equally imposing palace opposite. In the latter half of the 20th century, the rebuilt K\u00f6nigsbau became shortly the seat of Stuttgart's stock exchange, and a part of a large shopping centre called K\u00f6nigsbau Passagen, which extends behind the main building.   \n\n6 Schillerplatz (Schiller square). Named after the great poet Friedrich Schiller, whose statue stands in the middle of the square.   \n7 Stiftskirche (Collegiate Church). Built in 1175.   \n8 Prinzenbau. Built 1750.   \n9 Opernhaus (Opera House). Pass the New Palace to the left and you find yourself in the beautiful Schlossgarten with the Opernhaus in front of an artificial lake, as part of the Staatstheater Stuttgart. Also the parliament of the state of Baden-W\u00fcrrtemberg is there.   \n10 Hauptbahnhof (Main Railway Station). The Railway Station was built in 1920 as a terminus station. The 56-meter-high tower with its rotating and illuminated Mercedes-Benz is one of the most famous city landmarks. On top of the tower there is an exhibition of the most controversial infrastructure project in Germany called S21. The plan is to convert the main line terminus station into an underground through station by turning the tracks with a 90-degree angle to the present station. It's free to climb up and grants awesome views of K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe and the city.   \n11 Markthalle (Market Hall). A beautiful Jugendstil market hall built in 1910.   \n12 Wilhelmspalais (King William's Palace). (1834-1840)   \n13 Calwer passage (S-Bahn to Stadtmitte). Small gallery with little stores (somewhat similar to Milan's famous gallery but a lot smaller). Right next to it is a building whose exterior is covered with plants. (updated Sep 2021)\n\n\nClose to centre\n\n14 Liederhalle (Culture and Congress Centre). (1956)   \n15 Johanneskirche (St. John's Church). Although there is no Cologne Cathedral in Stuttgart, there are a few churches worth visiting. Most beautiful is the Johanneskirche, which is surrounded by the lake Feuersee and lighted at night. Other interesting churches are: M\u00e4tthauskirche (St. Matthew's Church), Domkirche St. Eberhard (St. Eberhard's Cathedral Church), Hospitalkirche (Hospital Church), Leonhardskirche (St. Leonard's Church), Veitskapelle (St. Vitus Chapel), St. Catherine's Church (English-speaking Anglican Church), St. Maria Kirche (St. Mary's Church).  \n16 Bohnenviertel. The Bohnenviertel is the only preserved part of Stuttgart's old town, having miraculously survived to the present day largely intact. Built mainly in the 14th century, it used to house the poorer part of the population, who fed mainly on beans which were grown all around the quarter in gardens and even hanging from the houses' walls, hence the name meaning \"bean quarter\". Today, the Bohnenviertel is thriving on artisanry and small, old-style retail, as well as gastronomy and red light district. (updated Aug 2021)\n\n17 Stadtbibliothek am Mail\u00e4nder Platz (Neue Bibliothek, Bibliothek 21). M-Sa 09:00-21:00. Stuttgart's city library moved into this spectacular new building in 2011. It took 13 years of planning, an international architectural competition (which was won by Eun Young Yi from South Korea) and \u20ac80 million to complete it. On the outside, it is a sombre, nine-storey cube with a glass-brick facade. Inside, the whitewashed surfaces and bright lighting provide an almost unreal ambiance. There is quite a lot of innovative features and facilities inside, not only related to the rather simple layout and fit-outs, but rather to the way the library itself works - for example, you can borrow not only books, but also works of art, or work with music and sound clips in the sound lab. There is also a cafe on the top floor (open 10:00-18:00), and you can get a free map and audioguide from the reception on the ground floor. Most facilities are free of charge, but to borrow books or media you will need to purchase at least a monthly pass for \u20ac4.   \n18 Qingyin garden (Garten der sch\u00f6nen Melodie) (Bus 44 - stop Im Kaisemer). 09:00 till dusk or 20:00, whichever comes sooner. A small Chinese garden, with a pond, ornamental walls and a mini-pagoda included, hidden on one of the hills close to the Hauptbahnhof.   \n19 Pragfriedhof-Krematorium (U-Bahn to Pragfriedhof). A beautiful Jugendstil crematorium with occasional exhibitions about transience. (updated Sep 2021)\n\n\nFarther out\n\n20 Weissenhof Estate (Wei\u00dfenhofsiedlung), Rathenaustra\u00dfe 1- 3. Tu-F 11:00-18:00; Sa Su 10:00-18:00. A world heritage listed housing estate built for exhibition in 1927, features residential buildings by such famous architects like Le Corbusier, Peter Behrens, Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In two semi-detached houses designed by Le Corbusier, there is a museum dedicated to the area. The historical building is not suitable for people using wheelchairs. normal ticket \u20ac5, reduced \u20ac2.   \n21 Schloss Solitude (Solitude Palace). The Solitude palace was built as a hunting lodge and summer residence in in 1769 and looks from the outside like a classical rococo palace. It is on a high plain outside Stuttgart and offers views to the north. During the opening hours there are guidance every 45 minutes. Ask for English guidance. \u20ac4/\u20ac2.   \n22 Old Town and Market in Bad Cannstatt (U1/U2/U13/U16 to Bad Cannstatt-Wilhelmsplatz or S1/S2/S3 to Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, then walk to the northwest). Bad Cannstatt is older than Stuttgart, and has been a thriving town when today's centre of Stuttgart was still a horse pasture. Moreover, unlike the centre of Stuttgart, the old town of Bad Cannstatt survived the Second World War relatively unscathed. Therefore, you can still get an authenthic, medieval feel wandering around its winding narrow streets, which all lead to a peculiarly-shaped market square.On the market square, you will find the town church of Cannstatt (Stadtskirche) and the old town hall, still in use as the district's government seat (Bezirksrathaus), both from the late 15th century. It also owns the oldest dwelling in Stuttgart (\"Kl\u00f6sterle\" / 15th century) that is now used as a wine tavern. \n\n23 Kurpark in Bad Cannstatt (U2 station Kursaal or alt. U1/U13 and U16 to Uff-Kirchhoff). Cannstatt owes the Bad (German for bath) in its name to numerous mineral water springs. To enable locals and visitors to enjoy them, a small but very peaceful Kurpark was arranged for in the 19th century, along with a large Kursaal (spa hall) building, which today is a restaurant and special event venue. Right next to it is the MineralBad-Cannstatt (Solebad Bad Cannstatt) spa-wellness-fitness complex with a large pool covered by an impressive glass dome. The Kurpark is divided into two parts Unterer (lower) Kurpark and Oberer (upper) Kurpark separated by Kursaal. The upper Kurpark provides a nice view of Bad Cannstatt.Close to Kurpark, around Uff-Kirchhoff, is the home of around 50 parrots (yellow headed amazons) that can be spotted throughout the year. They barely leave their trees (mainly platanus trees) but their distinctive cry can be heard from distance. It is the only population outside the Americas. (updated Sep 2021)\n24 Gottlieb Daimler Memorial (Gottlieb-Daimler-Ged\u00e4chtnisst\u00e4tte), Taubenheimstra\u00dfe 13 (Bad Cannstatt) (U2 station Kursaal). Tu-F 14:00-17:00, Sa Su and holidays 11:00-17:00, closed on Mondays.

Su-F 12:00-14:00 & from 18:00, Sa from 18:00. Renowned chef J\u00f6rg Mink cooks up a storm with schw\u00e4bischer recipes like your German grandmother used to make. Kalbshaxenfleisch in seiner eigenen So\u00dfe mit Riesling und Sahne verfeinert dazu Austernpilze und Handsp\u00e4tzle, Kartoffelsalat in Sch\u00fcsseln finished at your table is a recommendation at \u20ac23.50. \u20ac34.50 and less for mains. \n\n\nBreakfast\nIn the morning, locals definitely want to get some fresh bread (and brezels and broetchen [bread rolls/buns]) from the baker's shop and serve them with butter, cheese, ham, honey, jam and eggs from the fridge. Many locals and visitors will enjoy breakfast at the bakery itself, in the \"Stehcafe\" - literally, \"standing cafe\". These are usually a corner of the shop with tall tables which you stand at rather than sit at. Orange juice together with coffee or tea or hot chocolate will fit nicely. The breakfast in hotels will also look more or less that way.\nYou can also order this breakfast setup in some or the other cafe or pub, but you'd have to know the good places at first, if you don't want to end up with a poor dish. There are 3 Starbucks coffee shops along K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe (a 4th in the high-end district on Calwer Stra\u00dfe). But don't look for low-fat muffin or cream cheese options.\n\n\nDrink\nStuttgart has developed a vibrant nightlife with many clubs and pubs in the heart of the city. The most popular street for clubbing is the Theodor-Heuss-Stra\u00dfe (\"Theo\"). Several bars, clubs and lounges have opened here. During the summer, there are also many opportunities to have a drink outside. In the \"Theo\" you can listen to good house, drum'n'bass, hip-hop and other kinds of electronic music. However it is not always easy to get into most clubs because of the restrictive door policy!\nFor a more laid-back atmosphere try the area surrounding the \"Hans-im-Gl\u00fcck\" (\"Lucky Hans\") fountain just a stone's throw from K\u00f6nigsstra\u00dfe. In this charming quarter in Stuttgart's old town centre, many pubs and bars are crammed next to each other. Especially in the summer months a unique southern flair mixed with a great party scene with open-minded people make this area special.\nConcerts, nightclubs and events are covered by local magazines (generally not in English). Try Lift and Prinz.\nBecause street drinking is still legal in Germany budget-travellers can save some money if they buy their drinks at a supermarket. A beer is there, e.g. only \u20ac0.50 compared to \u20ac3 and more in pubs. There are two of the REWE supermarkets at the beginning and the end of the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe. There you can buy cheap snacks, softdrinks and alcoholic drinks from Monday to Saturday up till 22:00. Lots of young people do so and hang around the beautiful Schlossplatz.\n\n\nBars and pubs\n1 Palast der Republik, Friedrichstra\u00dfe 27. In a former public toilet house, the \"palace\" is the place to hang out in hot summer nights. Get your beer at the fastest barkeeper you've ever seen and find your place outside (maybe on the ground). \n2 Mata Hari (Hans-im-Gl\u00fcck-Brunnen). At the Mata Hari you can get exotic beer in an old-fashioned tea-house style. At long tables and benches young folks sit together and drink their beer. Contact to others comes therefore almost automatically. \n3 Biddy Earlys. A good place to go where everyone speaks English is Biddy Earlys, an Irish pub just west of the city centre/K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe, a 5-minute walk from the major public transport station \"Stadtmitte\" (S-Bahn, Stadtbahn). Keep a sharp eye because the entry is a mere doorway wide which leads down the stairs to the basement. Good bands on the weekends. \u20ac2-3 cover, \u20ac4 on weekends (plus a bag charge if you have a backpack). Everybody always welcome and you don't have to apologise for your poor German here! They show Premier League Championship and other British football here, you can celebrate or commiserate with only a handful of other drinkers. \n4 The Sky Beach (Parking D2). On top of the Kaufhof department store close to the main railway station. All sandy roof top bar. Opened only in summer time. \n5 Schocken, Hirschstr. 36. Ever changing music program with guests dancing in addition, superior live concerts of Indie to Black Metal and the unconstrained atmosphere on all floors of the multi-storied cult store - all this makes the Schocken to a well-earned an inalienable institution in the Stuttgart night life. \n6 Kap Tormentoso, Hirschstr. 27. Noble caf\u00e9 atmosphere in the first floor. In the basement mostly alternatives and hipsters sit on benches and drinks itself straight through the great drinking menu. Gets very crowded on weekends with a laid back outside area. No entrance fee but with DJs. (updated May 2015)\n7 Hotzenplotz, Silberburgstr. 88. Rustic atmosphere, little offside in Stuttgart-West. \n8 Kiste. Two great Jazzclubs are in the Hauptst\u00e4tterstr (Stadtbahn-station \"Rathaus\"). The \"Kiste\" (means \"box\": indeed a tiny club) charges \u20ac5 (added to the drink) for a concert, daily starting at 21:00 or 22:00. The \"Bix\" named after Bix Beiderbecke offers local to top-class-acts, entry from about \u20ac7-30, depending on the artist. \n9 Suite 212, Theodor-Heuss-Stra\u00dfe. to 05:00 on weekends. A posh bar/lounge with minimalist, urbane and undercool interior. People in the smart casual look sip their cocktails or wines around the large dance floor. On weekends the bar changes into a big party club exemplary for the night-life on the \"Theo\" party street. \n10 Fou Fou. A stylish champagner bar in a conglomerate of brothels and hotels letting rooms by the hour called the \"Bohnenviertel\" (Bean Quarter) between Hauptst\u00e4tter Str. and Olgastr. \n\n\nClubs\n11 Delayla. 23:00 - 07:00. The renovated basement rooms get crowded in the night. Don't try to go there before 02:00. \n12 Schr\u00e4glage, Marktstr. 6. The best independent HipHop club in town. \n13 Classic Rock Cafe. Another great bar is the Classic Rock Cafe which is a few blocks away from Biddy Early's. No cover charge here even on weekends and the music is great! Interesting decor too. And everyone is welcome! \n14 Kowalski. A stylishly designed electric club for an older audience. Here local DJs play fine electronic dance music, and sometimes an international bookings. Check the website for latest information. (updated May 2015)\n15 Freund und Kupferstecher, Berliner Platz. Reopened in 2014 this hip club has a great range of national performers of HipHop and electronic music. \u20ac5. (updated May 2015)\n16 Universum. This rock club is inside the underground stop \"Charlottenplatz\". It's on the right way out at the exit signed with \"Landtag\". Playing a lot of concerts in rock or independent music. \n17 Boa Disco, T\u00fcbinger Stra\u00dfe 12. Established in 1977 and still famous for the after-work-party that starts at 18:00 with a free buffet. Especially on Thursdays it gets very crowded so try to get on the guest list a few days before. \n18 Keller Club (near Roteb\u00fchlplatz). (indie dance music) \n19  Penthouse, Heilbronner Str. If you're looking for a posh club, you can try the Penthouse. In such places, it's hard to be overdressed. But even if you \"dress to impress\", there's no guarantee that the doormen will let you in. \n20 Perkins Park, Stresemannstr. 39. Also a posh club outside the city centre. \n\n\nGay & lesbian\nEagle (men-only leather bar)\nBoots (men-only country style bar)\nKings Club (mixed dance club)\nJenseitz (mixed gay bar)\nZap\n\n\nSleep\n\nTo stay in the city centre (Mitte) around the K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe is probably the nicest, but also most expensive option. Still in walking distance are the beautiful districts of West and S\u00fcd. Other accommodations further out in the districts Nord, Cannstatt, Feuerbach or Vaihingen are perfectly reachable by public transport. If you intend to arrive by car check at the hotel for parking possibilities. If you have an early morning flight, it is possible to spend the night in the airport, as check-in areas stay open at night.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Campingplatz Cannstatter Wasen (Cannstatt), \u260f +49 711 556696, info@campingplatz-stuttgart.de.

An older-style Etap hotel (blue fittings) that was not updated to the newer \"green room\" standard when rebranded as ibis Budget. Free WiFi in the rooms and foyer however the login webpage is very bad and sometimes the \"Gratis WLAN\" link doesn't display. During the week a room for 1 person is \u20ac49 with a \u20ac10 surcharge for a second person and \u20ac39 at the weekend. The rooms have a double bed and a single bed in them. \n\n\nMid-range\n6 Dormero Hotel Stuttgart, Plieninger Stra\u00dfe 100 (M\u00f6hringen), \u260f +49 711 721 0, stuttgart@dormero.com. The Dormero is a huge (over 450 rooms) 1980s-style tower hotel within the SI entertainment complex (cinema, musical theatre, casino, spa) in Moehringen, an outer district of Stuttgart close to the airport. Due to its particular location, arrival by public transit is not really simple. Double from \u20ac115. \n7 Hilton Garden Inn Stuttgart NeckarPark, Mercedesstr. 75 (Cannstatt). The Garden Inn is right between the Porsche and Mercedes-Benz arenas and mostly caters to the visitors of those venues. Prices tend to skyrocket during major events. The hotel is quite a bit away from the city centre and public transportation options are limited. The entire hotel is appointed in a very modern, elegant and consistent theme. Double from \u20ac80. \n8 Holiday Inn Stuttgart, Mittlerer Pfad 25-27 (Weilimdorf), \u260f +49 4971 1988880. Good quality rooms. One of the best breakfast buffets in town. Friendly, helpful and efficient staff. On the edge of town but with S-Bahn station next to hotel. Double from \u20ac140. \n9 ibis Styles Stuttgart (Canstatt, U2 stop Kursaal). The former Mercure Bad Canstatt was downgraded to ibis Styles, but it does not mean it is a bad hotel, but rather that you get your breakfast and WiFi included in the room prices. Rooms are basic but appropriate. The hotel is in a quiet suburb of Bad Canstatt, but you can easily get to the city with the Stadtbahn U2 which runs right in front of the hotel. Double from \u20ac100. \n10 ibis Stuttgart Centrum (Marienplatz), Marienplatz 8 - 10 (S\u00fcd). A typical old-style (green washbasins) ibis hotel right on the Marienplatz in southern Stuttgart. Double from \u20ac91. \n11 ibis Stuttgart City, Presselstra\u00dfe 15 (Nord). As with other Accor hotels in Stuttgart, this hotel's name can be deceiving, as it is decisively out of the city, in the Nordbahnhof area. Otherwise, it is a typical old-style ibis hotel. Double from \u20ac86. \n12 Kronen Hotel, Kronenstra\u00dfe 48 (Mitte). The independently operated Kronen Hotel may have some very questionable interior fittings, responding to the German idea of Gemuetlichkeit, but wins over guests by great service and location just 800  east of the Hauptbahnhof, in a quiet area. Double from \u20ac160. \n13 Mercure Stuttgart City Center, Heilbronner Stra\u00dfe 88 (Nord), \u260f +49 711 255580. Despite the name, the hotel is not in the city centre but rather some 1.5 km uphill north from the Hauptbahnhof. The decor and appointments are nondescript and a little dated and overall there is nothing really outstanding about this Mercure. Double from \u20ac71. (updated Sep 2021)\n14 Motel One Stuttgart-Hauptbahnhof, Lautenschlagerstra\u00dfe 14 (Mitte). This hotel is in the centre of Stuttgart, one block from both the Hauptbahnhof and the Koenigstra\u00dfe. Appointed in a modern and sleek but basic way like all other Motel Ones.

The Althoff enjoys a prime location next to the Hauptbahnhof, facing the Schlossgarten. There are various room categories, some large and facing the Schlossgarten, some rather small and with less fascinating views towards the backside, but overall the hotel ranks among the top ones in Stuttgart for its comfort and service quality, and charges accordingly. Double from \u20ac230. \n20 Arcotel Camino, Heilbronner Stra\u00dfe 21 (Mitte). The Arcotel is an art- and design-themed hotel in a historic building on Heilbronner Stra\u00dfe, north of the Hauptbahnhof.

Double from \u20ac160. \n24 Wyndham Stuttgart Airport Messe, Flughafenstra\u00dfe 51, \u260f +49 711 627680. \n\n\nConnect\nThe main telecommunications provider in Germany is Deutsche Telekom which trades under the names of T-Home (for landline phones), T-Online (for Internet connections) and T-Mobile for mobile communications. Anything relating to these companies are easily identified by the bright pink \"T\" logo. There are often shops in German towns called \"T-Punkt\" (Literally T-Point) where you can buy cell phones and get other information.\n\n\nNet\nCommercial WLAN-Hotspots are available at the airport and few other places.\nUsenet, see group: stgt.general\nIRCnet: join channel #stuttgart\n\n\nStay safe\nStuttgart is quite safe. Even at night one may walk alone through the city without fear. One rare exception is the central city park, which should be avoided during late night hours. The biggest danger for a pedestrian in Stuttgart is probably the cars (or the bicycles in the parks). As the city centre is at the bottom of a relatively deep valley and the traffic situation is far from satisfactory, Stuttgart has an endemic smog problem that gets worse when the weather \"traps\" the air in the valley. While there are attempts to combat the air pollution, for example by issuing discounted or free public transit tickets on smog days, the problem is likely to persist for some time.\nPretty much the whole state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is a risk zone for ticks. Some of them spread encephalitis or borreliosis.
