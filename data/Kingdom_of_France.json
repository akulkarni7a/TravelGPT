  "extract": "France is one of Europe's oldest countries, existing as a sovereign state since the 9th century, for most of its history as one of the great powers of the continent, and the world.\nThis article describes the history of France from the division of the Frankish Empire in the 9th century, until the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nWith the 843 Treaty of Verdun, the Frankish Empire was divided in three parts, among them West Francia, ruled by Charlemagne's grandson Charles the Bald (Charles II le Chauve). As the House of Capet came to hold the crown from 987, the dynasty of kings became known as the House of France with the kingdom to be known as France.\nThe Atlantic coast was targeted by Scandinavian Viking raids during the 9th and 10th century, stressing the need for fortifications and armies. The Normans were descendants of Norsemen who settled in northern France, converting to Catholicism and adopting the French language.\n\n\nMedieval France\nThe High Middle Ages were a period from the 11th to the 13th century, which saw the rise of many of France's most famous cathedrals, universities and castles. The most prevalent construction style is known to posterity as Gothic architecture. The word ch\u00e2teau describes a grand house with or without fortifications. France saw a sharp division between the three Estates: nobles, clergy, and commoners (the Third Estate). The two first had several privileges, including tax exemption, and opportunities for education and public office.\nIn the 11th century the kingdom was expanded southward by a crusade against the Cathars.\nThe Late Middle Ages were marked by the Hundred Years' War from 1337 to 1453, where the House of Valois, supported by several European allies, defeated the usurping Anglo-French House of Plantagenet (see Medieval Britain and Ireland). The Valois French were famously led in battle by Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), breaking the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, at age 17. The English framed her as a witch, and burnt her at the stake two years later. She was canonized, and is now the patron saint of France.\n\n\nEarly Modern France\nThe end of the Hundred Years War is usually considered the end of medieval France, as the French state became consolidated, and one of the great powers of early modern Europe and the Age of Discovery.\nThe French Colonial Empire had some possessions already in the 16th century; see New France. The most valuable property was in the Caribbean, where plantations worked by African slaves gave great wealth to the Empire.\nThe Protestant Reformation had some support in France, with the Huguenots as a notable denomination. The Reformation caused a series of civil wars won by the Catholics. The government purged Protestants in the 17th and 18th centuries leading up to massacres by the thousands, causing many of them to emigrate to Protestant countries and to overseas colonies.\nFrance's main rival was the House of Habsburg, which ruled both the Spanish Empire and the Austrian Empire. In the Thirty Years' War, France sided with the mainly Protestant anti-imperial alliance. The allied victory allowed France to annex eastern territories, and to replace Spain as the dominant power in western Europe.\nFrance became a main destination on the Grand Tour, and a centre for European art and European classical music.\nIf any French monarch deserves to be mentioned distinctively, it would be Louis XIV; the Sun King, who became king at age 4 in 1643, reigning until his death in 1715, longer than any known European monarch. He saw the height of the French Empire's power, and gathered unsurpassed wealth and prestige. He represented the monarch's divine right to power, which over time became challenged by the philosophers of the Enlightenment (including Rousseau, Voltaire and Montesquieu), sowing the seed to the French Revolution.\nIn the Seven Years War, Britain defeated France and came to dominate North America. Both sides were deep in debt, and the tax burden on the British colonies in North America caused them to revolt and form the United States of America, supported by France. The American revolution inspired anti-monarchists around the world including France, where the Third Estate was also heavily taxed to pay the war debt.\n\n\nFrench Revolution and subsequent conflicts\nFrance remained a monarchy up to the French Revolution which began in 1789 and lasted for a decade, leading up to the French Revolutionary Wars. L'Ancien R\u00e9gime, the \"Ancient Regime\" is, since the revolution, the description of the abolished French monarchy. The revolution inspired similar uprisings around the world, and was so momentous that historians consider it to mark the end of the early modern era and the beginning of modernity; the era in which we live today.\nThe motto of the revolution was Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9 (liberty, egality, fraternity), largely the antithesis of the old regime.\nThe 19th century was marked by the Napoleonic Wars and subsequent revolutions, most notably the 1830 July Revolution and the 1848 Revolution. France has altered between monarchy and republic, and the current form of government since 1958 is known as the Fifth Republic (Cinqui\u00e8me R\u00e9publique). The 19th century also saw France becoming a world leader in industry and science.\n\n\nRead\nThe Kingdom of France is the setting of many classical adventure novels, such as Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers series and The Count of Monte Cristo. Many immortal writers like Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, Voltaire, Moli\u00e8re and Charles Perrault lived and built their reputations in this period.\n\n\nDestinations\n\n1 Mont Saint-Michel.
