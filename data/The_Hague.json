  "extract": "The Hague (Dutch: Den Haag or  's-Gravenhage) is a city in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. It is the seat of the Dutch parliament and government, and the residence of King Willem-Alexander. It is not the capital city, which is Amsterdam. The municipality (which is the city) has more than 548,000 inhabitants (2021), making it the third largest city in the Netherlands. \nThe Hague lies on the North Sea and is home to Scheveningen, the most popular seaside resort in the Netherlands. Also the smaller resort of Kijkduin is part of the city.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nInternationally, The Hague is often known as the \"judicial capital of the world\" due to the many international courts that are located in the city. Among these are the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and, since 2004, the International Criminal Court. Beside these institutions, The Hague is home to more than 150 international organizations, and to many EU institutions, multinational companies and embassies. This gave the city a distinct international character \u2014 one that is noticeably different from Amsterdam. Rather than having the many foreign tourists and fortune-seekers attracted by Amsterdam's reputation for excitement and liberalism, The Hague generally has more expatriates working and living in the city because of the number of international institutions and companies. Because of this, The Hague has a reputation as a wealthy, conservative and somewhat sedate city.\nThe Hague has very little of the edginess and excitement of Amsterdam; however, it provides well for its inhabitants in different ways, such as large areas of green space, 11 km of coastline, attractive shopping streets and an extensive multicultural scene. Rather than having canals like other Dutch cities, The Hague has streets and avenues that are just a little bit wider than those in the rest of the country, giving the city a more continental feel. Instead of the typical Dutch renaissance 17th-century step-gabled houses, it has 18th-century mansions in baroque and classicist styles. The city is considered by many as the most stately of the country. Just outside the city centre, posh neighbourhoods effuse a more 19th century look with eclectic and art nouveau architecture.\nThe farther you get from the sea front and the city centre, however, the more neighbourhoods tend to become less well-off. One dividing line between affluent and sketchier areas is drawn by some at Laan van Meerdervoort, which runs parallel to the seaside. Areas away from the sea tend to have much less in the way of green space. An exception to this is one centrally located park, Zuiderpark, which also used to contain the stadium of the local football team ADO Den Haag. Some of its supporters were known as the most notorious hooligans of the country, perpetuating a stereotype of \"lower-class\" for the inhabitants of that area.\nThe Hague offers great architecture, from the picturesque government complex of the Binnenhof, to the grand and stately mansions on Lange Voorhout. Museums like the Mauritshuis rank among the best in the country. For food aficionados, The Hague offers some of the country's best Indonesian cuisine, due to large-scale immigration from this former Dutch colony. The city also offers good opportunities for outings, such as extensive green spaces for walking and bicycling as well as dunes and seaside recreation areas just a few tram stops away from the city centre. The Hague also offers a few attractions especially appealing to children, such as the miniature city of Madurodam and the 360 degree Omniversum cinema.\n\nThe city has undergone an extensive amount of development in the form of modern architecture projects. Constructions include the City Hall and Central Library by American architect Richard Meier, De \"Snoeptrommel\" (known by the locals as Candy-Box) - a round shopping centre next to the old town hall, and a collection of post-modern, brick-clad office towers in between the city hall and the Centraal railway station, which provide new housing for a number of ministries. A major infrastructural development has been the construction of an underground tram tunnel underneath Grote Marktstraat, which is used by regular trams, and a new light-rail system, known as RandstadRail, linking The Hague with the neighbouring cities of Zoetermeer and Rotterdam.\nA major redevelopment project is underway in the area around the Centraal railway station. Here, skyscrapers like the 142 m Hoftoren rise up over the city and several other high-rise towers are under construction.\nSince 2015, The Hague and its suburbs have been part of the Rotterdam-The Hague Metropolitan Region.\n\n\nTourist information\nDen Haag Tourist information website\n1 VVV Den Haag (the main tourist information office), Spui 68 (at the Central Library, next to the town hall), vvv@denhaag.com. M 12:00-20:00, Tu-F 10:00-20:00, Sa 10:00-17:00, Su 10:00-17:00. (updated Jun 2016)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nThe Rotterdam The Hague Airport (RTM IATA) is the closest airport to the city. Metro line E connects Den Haag Centraal station with the Meijersplein, a station close to the airport. The airport terminal is connected with the later one by bus line #33 (which continues further up to the Rotterdam Centraal railway station).\nThe Schiphol Amsterdam Airport (AMS IATA), is a bit farther. However, with several direct trains per hour from the railway stations Hollands Spoor and Centraal, and also with an hourly night train from station Hollands Spoor, it is more frequently used by people travelling to and from The Hague by air.\n\n\nBy train\nSee also: Rail travel in the Netherlands\n\nThe Hague has two main train stations, serving domestic and international routes.\n\n1 Den Haag Centraal Station (Den Haag CS). is the biggest train station in The Hague. It is within walking distance of the city centre and from Malieveld park. Den Haag Centraal has connections to Amsterdam (45 minutes), Schiphol Airport (30 minutes), Utrecht (35 minutes), Groningen (2\u00bd hours) and many other cities throughout the Randstad and the Netherlands. Passengers coming from Rotterdam can also use that city's Metro line E to travel to Den Haag Centraal. You can get to Centraal Station from a variety of international destinations such as Cologne, Berlin, Frankfurt, Prague, and Basel via the city of Utrecht. Upon arrival, the city centre of The Hague is about a 5 minute walk from the Centraal Station. Leave through the left side entrance (look for the tram station stops) and walk through the glass passageway and straight ahead. There are luggage storage lockers at the station.   (updated May 2023)\n\n2 Den Haag Hollands Spoor (Den Haag HS). It is a 20-min walk from Central Station. It has connections by intercity train to Antwerp and Brussels, as well as domestic connections to Rotterdam, Eindhoven, Amsterdam, Leiden and Delft. Southbound trains from Den Haag CS always pass through Hollands Spoor. To get to the city centre, walk straight ahead from the main entrance and follow the Stationsweg road through Chinatown, and you will end up right in the middle of town.   \nVisitors are most likely to use Centraal Station, as it is closer to the centre, tourist attractions and shopping. It also has the best local public transport links via tram and bus, and is also safer at night than Hollands Spoor, which is in a somewhat sketchy area of town. The only reason for using Hollands Spoor is to catch the international trains to Antwerp and Brussels. In addition to southbound trains from Centraal, tram lines 9, 15, 16 and 17 also cover the short distance from Centraal Station to Hollands Spoor. From both stations leave trains that go to and from Schiphol Airport.\nIf you are coming from Amsterdam, the fastest intercity trains to The Hague depart from the Amsterdam Zuid Station (can be reached by metro from central Amsterdam in 10 minutes) every 30 minutes throughout the day, directly to Den Haag Centraal, and also every 30 minutes throughout the day, directly to Den Haag Hollands Spoor. From Amsterdam Centraal leave Sprinter trains making all local stops along the way, so they take longer; and intercity trains from Amsterdam Centraal travel a slightly longer route via Haarlem and only stop at Hollands Spoor.\n\n\nBy car\nThe Hague is connected by toll-free motorways to Amsterdam (A4 and A44), Rotterdam (A13) and Utrecht (A12). Access to the centre is through the A12 motorway that penetrates the city centre, like a needle, and ends on a large traffic junction just north of the historic centre. Approaching and leaving the city from any of these motorways can take a long time during the morning and evening rush hours. On hot summer days, hundreds of thousands of people try to reach Scheveningen beach by car, and huge traffic jams of up to 50 km long may occur, causing traffic delays of up to several hours. On such days, consider taking public transportation. The park and ride facility P+R Hoornwijck opened in 2008 on the Laan van Hoornwijck by the Ypenburg interchange. Motorists can easily reach it from the A4 (Exit 9) and A13 (Exit 7). From here, you can take tram 15 to the city centre.\n\n\nGet around\n\n \n \n\n\nBy public transport\n\nThe Hague has an efficient and frequent city wide system of light rail (called RandstadRail), trams and buses, running mostly on tracks separated from other traffic, allowing for a fairly speedy ride. HTM runs the public transport system in The Hague and some of the surrounding area. Rotterdam-based RET runs a Randstadrail line (Metro Line E) between The Hague and Rotterdam, through various suburbs, though reaching Rotterdam is often times quicker by taking an Intercity train. Veolia provides regional bus services to the areas surrounding The Hague. EBS operates the suburban bus routes.\nCentraal Station has eight platforms for trams, split across a high level inside of the station and a low level (Rijnstraat) to the south side of the station. These are:\n\nA (high level) for  3  to Loosduinen,  4  to eventcentre De Uithof;\nB (high level) for  2  to Kraayenstein and  6  to Leyenburg via Haagse Markt;\nC (high level) for  2  to Leidschendam via Laan van NOI and  6  to Leidschendam via Mariahoeve station;\nD (high level) for  3  and  4  to Zoetermeer;\nE (low level) for  9  to Scheveningen via Madurodam and  16  to Statenkwartier via Buitenhof;\nF (low level) for  15  to Nootdorp via Buitenhof and Hollands Spoor;\nG (low level) for  17  to Wateringen via Hollands Spoor and Rijswijk;\nH (low level) for  9  to Vrederust via Hollands Spoor and  16  to Wateringen via Hollands Spoor and Moerwijk.\nFurthermore, buses stop above the railway tracks and how to reach them is indicated through signage.\nHollands Spoor has four platforms for trams, located at the front of the station. Buses have a halt at the backside of the station. One more stop (Waldorpstraat/Station HS) is located fairly close to the station, being accessible by exiting out the front of the station and turning left.\n\nA for:\nLine  1  to Tanthof (Delft) via Rijswijk and Delft's stations;\nLine  11  to Scheveningen Haven via Haagse Markt;\nLine  12  to Duindorp via Haagse Markt;\nLine  16  to Wateringen via Moerwijk;\nB for  9  to Vrederust via Moerwijk and  17  to Wateringen via Rijswijk;\nC for:\nLine  1  to Scheveningen Noord via Vredespaleis and World Forum;\nLines  11  and  12  to Rijswijkseplein;\nLine  16  to Statenkwartier via CS and Buitenhof;\nD for  9  to Scheveningen Noord via CS and Madurodam and  17  to Rijswijkseplein;\nWaldorpstraat (near Rijswijkseplein) for  15  to Den Haag Centraal via Buitenhof and to Nootdorp via Rijswijk.\nService usually runs from 06:00 until 00:00, although service starts at 07:00 Saturday and 08:00 on Sunday.\nOn Friday and Saturday nights HTMBuzz operates six night bus services. Tickets for these are more expensive (\u20ac5) and only available from the bus driver. All night services meet at Buitenhof in the city centre every hour.\n\n\nTickets\nIf you use public transport, you will need a valid ticket. The strippenkaart is no longer valid. You can travel by OV-chipkaart, which is a public transport smart card. This card can be bought at the HTM offices at Central Station (you find the office upstairs at the bus terminal), Hollands Spoor and in Wagenstraat, among other places.\nYou can also buy a 2-hour ticket directly from a driver in normal trams and buses when boarding, these tickets are valid on all trams and buses by HTM or HTMBuzz. RandstadRail trams (the blue-white ones) instead have a ticket machine that accepts coins and credit cards. If this ticket machine is broken (more often than not), you have to buy a ticket from the ticket inspector (if there is one).\n\n HTM travel cards. 2 hour and 1 day cards are available from a driver on buses and trams, at the machines in the RandstadRail tram (lines 3, 4 and 19) with coins only, and in the R-net trams (line 2 and 11) with coins, a bank card (Dutch or most European cards) or a credit card. 1 day and 3 day cards can be purchased from machines at the HTM Service Points at Den Haag Centraal, Den Haag HS and Zoetermeer Centrum-West railway stations, as well as the VVV Den Haag (situated in the City Library on Spui). These passes are valid through The Hague, Delft, Zoetermeer, Leidschendam, Voorburg, Wateringen and Scheveningen. 2-Uurskaart (2 hour) \u20ac4.00, Dagkaart (1 day) \u20ac7.10, 3 days \u20ac18.00. (updated May 2019)\n Tourist Day Ticket. The card is valid in the South Holland Rotterdam and the Hague region with the following carriers: Arriva, Connexxion, HTM, HTMbuzz, RET, Veolia and Waterbus. The Tourist Day Ticket is not valid on trains, Fast Ferry, Driehoeksveer Ferry, (small) neighborhood buses, night buses, public transport taxis, or on buses 195 and 295. The card is available from service points of transport carriers of the region, tourist information offices (VVV) and some hotels. \u20ac14.50. (updated May 2019)\nThe fine for not having a valid ticket is \u20ac50 plus the cost of a normal ticket. Ticket inspectors board trams and light rail at random, either in uniform or plain clothes.\n\n\nBy car\nCar traffic in the inner city is very limited. Many of them are operated by a company called Q-Park.\n\nSome centrally located parkings are:\n2 Grote Markt (Can be entered from both ends of the Grote Marktstraat). Right under the Grote Marktstraat, one of the main shopping streets. Some shops have an underground connection to this parking. Capacity: 390 cars. (updated Aug 2023)\n3 Spui, Spui 160 (Entrance in front of the Mercure Hotel.). Under the Spuiplein. Capacity: 199 cars. (updated Aug 2023)\n4 Centrum, Kranestraat (Entrance at the Kranestraat.). Capacity: 711 cars. (updated Aug 2023)\n5 City Parking, Laan 7. Capacity: 223 cars. (updated Aug 2023)\nMobypark (a shared parking platform) often offers cheaper prices than public parking garages and they have over 40 parkings available in The Hague. If you are planning to use them you need to book online in advance.\nMore parkings are a little bit further from the main shopping area. They are at 6 Torenstraat/Geest (286 cars), 7 Lutherse Burgwal (282 cars) and 8 Malieveld (600 cars). The last one is convenient for a visit to the Denneweg area.\n\n\nBy bike\nThe Hague has a great network of bike paths. A wide variety of bike rentals are available. In addition, app-based rentals are offered e.g. by HTM Bike, Donkey Republic (The Hague) and OV-fiets (requires a personalised OV-chipkaart).\n\n\nBy foot\nThe Hague's city centre is fairly compact and you can easily navigate the area on foot. From Centraal Station, it is about a 10 min walk to the Binnenhof and the Hofvijver pond.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nCentre\n\nThe heart of the city contains most of the historic architecture from the medieval, renaissance, and Baroque periods and is easily accessible on foot. You'll also find lots of outdoor cafes and shopping near the Plein on the Lange Poten or just east of there on the Hofweg.\n\n1 Plein (southwest from Centraal Station along Herengracht and Korte Poten). This square \u2014 Plein simply translates as 'square' in English \u2014 is one of the most elegant in the centre. Located right next to the Binnenhof, it is lined with historic government buildings on three of its four sides. The north side is lined with bars and caf\u00e9s, which spill out onto the square in summer. These sidewalk caf\u00e9s are quite popular with politicians from the neighbouring Binnenhof, and even Prime Minister Mark Rutte can be spotted here with a pint regularly. The square is also the scene for demonstrations against government policies. The statue in the middle is that of William of Orange, heralded as the founding father of the Dutch nation.   \n\n2 Binnenhof (northwest of the Plein, trams 1 and 9 (Spui stadhuis stop), trams 2, 3, 4 & 6 (Spui/Centrum stop)), \u260f +31 70 7570200, info@binnenhofbezoek.nl. No visits possible, the Binnenhof is closed for restauration. The Binnenhof (Inner Court) is a castle built in the 13th century as residence of the count of Holland. Ever since, it has almost subsequently been the seat of the government of Holland, and later all of the Netherlands. It used to be surrounded by moats on all sides. Since then it has been modified countless times to accommodate the expanding Dutch government. The moats have been filled, but the castle still borders on a pond (the Hofvijver, Court Pond). In its waters the old buildings continue to mirror themselves. Today, the Binnenhof houses the two chambers of the Dutch parliament and the Prime Minister's office in a small octagonal tower opposite the Mauritshuis. Enter through one of the gates on Plein or Buitenhof and you will find yourself in a medieval enclosed courtyard, surrounded by architecture from the 13th up to the 19th century. There may be crowds gathered here on occasion because of public demonstrations, TV airings or receptions for foreign officials. In the centre stands the Ridderzaal (Knight's Hall), the centrepiece of the castle, today used for ceremonial purposes. Unfortunately, the other splendid rooms of the complex are closed to the general public. It is possible, however, to attend the meetings of the parliament. The House of Representatives of the parliament meets every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, in a modern chamber from 1992. The Senate meets on a weekly basis, on Tuesdays, and does so in a splendid 17th century Dutch-styled chamber with a lavishly painted ceiling. Because the Binnenhof is closed for several years (reopening is expected in 2028) there is a temporary view tower at the Buitenhof square, from where you can view some of the progress of the restauration.   (updated Nov 2024)\n\n3 Mauritshuis, Plein 29 (next to the Binnenhof), mail@mauritshuis.nl. M-W F Sa 10:00-18:00, Th 10:00-20:00 (M 10:00-17:00 from Apr-Aug). Housed in a 17th-century palace overlooking the water of the Hofvijver pond, the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis contains the former collection of last Dutch stadtholder, William the V. While the museum is quite small (a complete tour takes a little over an hour) it contains some of the most famous work from the old Dutch Masters, including Johannes Vermeer (Girl with a Pearl Earring and View of Delft), Rembrandt van Rijn (The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp), Andy Warhol (\"Queen Beatrix\"), Rembrandt self-portraits at ages 20 and 63, and others. It is well worth a visit, especially as it has just been renovated. Adult \u20ac14, under 18 get in free.   (updated Apr 2015)\n4 Galerij Prins Willem V (Prince William V Gallery), Buitenhof 33. Tu-Su 12:00-17:00. This gallery essentially is a part of Mauritshuis. A collection of 18th-century paintings from the Mauritshuis is on display there. \u20ac5; combined ticket with Mauritshuis \u20ac17.50.   (updated Mar 2021)\n5 Gevangenpoort (Prison Gate Museum), Buitenhof 33, \u260f +31 70 3460861. Tu-F 10:00-17:00, Sa Su 12:00-17:00. Built in 1370 as an entrance gate to the Binnenhof complex, the Gevangenpoort (Prison Gate) was converted into a prison in 1420. In 1853 the prison shutdown and it was turned into a museum. For a taste of medieval justice, have a look at their collection of torture instruments and get locked inside an original medieval cell block. \u20ac7.50; + Galerij Prins Willem V \u20ac10.00.   (updated Jun 2016)\n6 Bredius Museum, Lange Vijverberg 14, \u260f +31 70 3620729, info@museumbredius.nl. Tu-Su 11:00-17:00. The private collection of Abraham Bredius, a 19th-century art historian contains Dutch Baroque art, as well as drawings, porcelain and crafted silver. \u20ac7.00.   \n7 Lange Voorhout (northwest along either side of the entrances to the Binnenhof). This former extension of The Hague Forest is now a large tree-lined square, bordered on all sides by grand 18th century townhouses. The large Baroque building on the west side is the 'Huis Huguetan', home to the Dutch supreme court. The square is especially pretty in spring, when its crocuses are in bloom. On Thursdays and Sundays there is a very good antique and book market. Every summer, the square hosts Den Haag Sculptuur (The Hague Sculpture), a free outdoor sculpture exhibition.   \n\n8 Escher in Het Paleis, Lange Voorhout 74 (trams 16, 17 (Korte Voorhout stop)), \u260f +31 70 4277730, info@escherinhetpaleis.nl. Tu-Su 11:00-17:00. This former royal palace was converted in 2002 into a museum dedicated to the famous Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher. The first two floors display prints, sketches and archive material showing how Escher progressed from realistic pictures to his later works of optical illusion and geometrical pattern. The top floor offers a trip through Escher's worlds with interactive screens and games and a special Escher Room. There are also scavenger hunts for younger children. On Sunday and during the school holidays, there are workshops for children. \u20ac9.50.   \n9 Grote Kerk (St Jacobs kerk). Now a meetings venue.   (updated Jun 2016)\n10 Nieuwe Kerk (New Church). Built in 1649-1656, so it is not so new anymore. Now it serves as a concert hall. In the garden is the grave monument of Baruch Spinoza.   (updated Oct 2021)\n11 Oude Stadhuis. The original town hall is a small building from the 15th century when The Hague was a small settlement around the Royal Court. In the 18th century it was expanded upon and now has a grand fa\u00e7ade facing the 15th-century Grote Kerk (Big Church), originally used as city's main place of worship, but now primarily functions as an exhibition space.   \n\n12 Stadhuis. In the early 1990s, the municipality moved to this enormous white building by American architect Richard Meier, nicknamed by locals as the Ice Palace. Walk in to have a look at the lofty main hall, which has exhibits on various topics related to the city. The two air bridges through the hall connecting the various offices had to be fenced off to prevent suicides, but still make for a nice view of the atrium below. The city hall borders a large, somewhat barren modern square with a fountain. It contrasts sharply with the Baroque Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), located in a small park in the other side of the road.   \n13 Denneweg. This street is a prime area for finding antique and specialty shops. It also has some good pubs and upscale restaurants to recharge in after shopping. Parallel to the Denneweg run the Hooigracht and Smidswater canals, which are two of the very few canals in The Hague compared to other major Dutch cities and towns.  \n\n14 Paleis Noordeinde (Noordeinde Palace). This is the royal palace that King Willem-Alexander uses as his office. While the inside is not open to the public, the 17th-century fa\u00e7ade can be seen from Noordeinde street, which also has a large number of art galleries. In the summer of 2023 the palace will be opened daily 10:00\u201317:00 to the public for the limited period of 1\u201313 August (7 August excepted). The 15 Royal Stables  are also opened during that period daily 12:00\u201317:00. Tickets (\u20ac10 for the palace, \u20ac7.50 for the stables and \u20ac15 for a combination ticket palace/stables) are available from this website from 12 June 10:00. The 16 Palace Gardens on the opposite side of the palace are accessible to the public for walking.   \n\n\nStatenkwartier Area\n\nThe Statenkwartier area, located between the dunes and the centre, has leafy avenues and 19th century housing and is very popular with The Hague's large expatriate community. The area is nice for walking tours of the 19th-century mansions, which showcase architectural diversity in The Hague. All kinds of neo- and modern-styles are represented here, especially Art Nouveau architecture. Good shops, delicatessens and restaurants are to be found on Statenkwartier's main street, Frederik Hendriklaan, or 'Fred'. The area also has a number of tourist attractions, which make it worth a visit, most of them being clustered around the Gemeentemuseum on Stadhouderslaan.\n\n17 Kunstmuseum Den Haag, Stadhouderslaan 41 (tram 17 (Kunstmuseum stop) or bus 24 (Statenplein stop)), \u260f +31 70 3381111, info@kunstmuseum.nl. Tu-Su 11:00-17:00. The Kunstmuseum (Art Museum) has a small collection of classical modern art (Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Monet, Sisley, Degas, Bacon). It boasts an especially large collection of Mondrians, showcasing the entire career of this painter known for his works with red, blue and yellow shapes. The Kunstmuseum also has a large selection of paintings of the Hague School, a 19th century movement of landscape artists, in addition to period rooms and collections of fashion, musical instruments and decorative arts. Rotating exhibitions on 19th- and early 20th-century art held here are also quite popular. The museum is housed in a yellow brick building built in 1938 by Dutch architect Hendrik Berlage, a pioneer in modern architecture and best known for his Beurs van Berlage - the exchange building on the Damrak in Amsterdam. Next to the Kunstmuseum are the GEM, a museum with rotating exhibitions of contemporary art, and the Fotomuseum Den Haag, which has rotating photography exhibitions. \u20ac17.50.

The Peace Palace was built in 1913, to house the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which was hoped to provide a means to legally settle international disputes. Ironically, World War I broke out just a year later. Today the Peace Palace also houses the International Court of Justice, the principal judicial body of the UN, which settles disputes between countries only.

Like the majority of cities in the Netherlands, The Hague is extremely bike friendly and it's easy to get from one place to another on a bicycle if you feel like stepping outside the city centre. Scheveningen (and to a lesser extent Kijkduin) is a busy seaside resort filled with boardwalk cafes and close to the dunes. The prime months to get out and see The Hague on foot or by pedal are in the late spring, summer, and early fall months. The beachfront area can get extremely crowded as vacationers from all over Europe come to visit and bask along the North Sea coastline.\n\n\nParks\n\n1 Park Clingendael.

It stretches from the suburb of Wassenaar to the northeast and goes right to the doorstep of Centraal Station, where there is a small fenced off area with deer. Haagse Bos also has a large birds-nest built on top of a pole with which the local municipality has succeeded in attracting a pair of storks, since the stork is in the city's emblem. Huis ten Bosch, the King's palace (not open to the public), is located there.

End of May/beginning of June. This claims to be the largest Eurasian festival in the world. Since its first edition in 1958 it has been the quintessential event and meeting place for the country's sizable Dutch-East-Indian community.

The festival is held in large tents on the Malieveld, opposite Centraal. \n Den Haag Sculptuur. June, July and August. Free sculpture exposition on Lange Voorhout with different themes each year. \nPrinsjesdag. Third Tuesday in September. Prinsjesdag or 'Princes Day' marks the beginning of the new parliamentary year.

He makes the trip in the Gouden Koets (Golden Carriage), a gift from the people of Amsterdam to his great-grandmother Wilhelmina from 1903. The carriage is used only for this special occasion. However the Gouden koets undergoes a restoration and is replaced by the Glazen Koets (Glass Carriage) during the years 2016-2019. In the Knight's Hall, the King then performs his duty as the formal head of state by reading out the Troonrede (Throne Speech) to the gathered chambers of the parliament. The throne speech contains a summary of the policies the cabinet is planning to implement over the next year.\n Crossing Border Festival. November. \n TodaysArt Festival. Last weekend of September. International Festival Beyond Art. \n\n\nWork\nMany people move to the Randstad area (including The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam) either for a year out, work (as an Expatriate) or to join partners (who are mostly either Expatriates or Dutch).  There are specialist websites for English and non-Dutch speakers looking to work in The Hague (and Randstad area) and a good place to start; Blue Lynx - Employment by Language.\nImmigration matters are dealt with by the Immigration Service IND. Registration is done by both police and municipalities. Immigration policy is restrictive and deliberately bureaucratic. That is especially true for non-EU citizens.\nEuropean Union citizens do not require a work permit. Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians are afforded a one year working-holiday visa. In general the employer must apply for work permits. Immigration is easier for \"knowledge migrants\" earning a gross annual salary of over \u20ac45,000 (over \u20ac33,000 for those under 30).\n\n\nBuy\n\nThe lively and historical centre of The Hague is perfect for a day of shopping. The shopping area around the Spuistraat and Grote Marktstraat is busy seven days a week. You can find the best shopping in The Hague on the side streets that circle out from the city centre. While lots of them are upscale, you can find a few bargain stores dotted here and there.\n\n1 De Bijenkorf, Wagenstraat 32 (corner of Grote Marktstraat). The only extant department store in The Hague is housed in a large building from 1924, built in a unique expressionist style with brick and copper.

If you're dragging extra copies of books across Europe, but don't want to throw them away, try trading them in here. \n\n\nEat\n\nJust as Indian restaurants abound in the UK, the Netherlands has an excellent tradition in Indonesian and colonial Dutch-Indies cuisine. After Indonesia became independent from the Netherlands in 1945, the country received a large number of former colonials from Dutch and mixed descent who had been forced to leave the newly independent colony. The Hague received a relatively large number of these people and is still a centre of the Dutch-Indonesian community.\nThe town has dubbed the area around Gedempte Gracht, Gedempte Burgwal and Wagenstraat as its local Chinatown, and added street signs in Chinese and all that. The area is not particularly spectacular, but good Chinese food is to be found around here.\n\n\nBudget\n1 't Achterommetje, Achterom, 71 (across the parliament).

Cafe Momfer de Mol is located in the centre of the old Hague a place steeped in history. The cafe in its present form has been in existence since 2003, and is one of the finest laid-back cafe-bars of the city. The warm interiors and the informal ambiance at the cafe, are ideal allies to its delightful snack menu. \n\n\nCoffee shops\nAs everywhere in the Netherlands, the possession (of small quantities) and use of cannabis (hash and weed) is tolerated in The Hague. Since Amsterdam draws more coffee-shop tourism, prices are lower in The Hague. Some renowned places:\n\n Cafe Cremers, Prinsestraat 84. A great pub and coffeeshop with great DJs. The one place where international visitors gather to smoke and drink. Don't miss it. \n Ceylon, Edisonstraat 98. \n Fly High, Rijswijkseweg 229. \n Seventh Planet, Loosduinseweg 741. \nPossessing large quantities of hashish or cannabis is a crime in the Netherlands. Do not take stuff with you when leaving the Netherlands (you can be punished severely in neighbouring countries). It's also unwise to buy for someone else, especially if it's a foreigner as you can be punished in his or her country of origin.\nSmoking tobacco is banned inside food and drink establishments \u2014 even coffeeshops! That being said, tobacco smoking appears to be tolerated in coffee shops, and their rolled joints are often mixed with tobacco.\n\n\nNightclubs\n5 Paard van Troje and Paard Caf\u00e9. Also a venue for concerts and such. Prinsegracht 12. \n\n\nSleep\n\nDespite its size and international prominence, The Hague has few hotels. Most of them are geared towards business guests, although there is a fair selection across price ranges. As the Randstad is very well connected with frequent train services, trams and buses, you may also consider accommodation in the neighbouring cities of Delft, Leiden, Zoetermeer, Rijswijk or even Rotterdam.\n\n\nBudget\n1 easyHotel den Haag. easyHotels are a sister hotel chain to the no-frills airline easyJet, and run along similar principles - only the accommodation in the (very simple) rooms are included in the base price, and everything else is charged extra. The location, however, is really central. The front faces the busy Parkstraat with trams. \n2 Holiday Inn Express The Hague - Parliament.

Be aware that some rooms face the rather small inner atrium rather than the outside. \n3 Ibis Den Haag City Centre (Jan Hendrikstraat 10). A fairly standard ibis hotel with a central location, with some rooms overlooking the busy Jan Hendrikstraat with trams, while others the peaceful courtyard garden (Nutstuin). \n4 Stayokay Den Haag, Scheepmakersstraat 27 (tram 17 (Rijswijkseplein stop)), \u260f +31 70 3157888, denhaag@stayokay.com. This standard but relatively soulless and uninspiring backpacking hostel has double rooms with individual toilet and shower facilities, and 8-bed dorms. It is huge, quite corporate so don't expect too much of a personal touch here. The hostel has a good location, being close to the Hollands Spoor train station (a 5 minute walk). Hostelling International members get discounts at Stayokay, and you can get a one-year membership card that is useful if you're staying at other HI Hostels. There are internet facilities available to lodgers at a reasonable fee. \n5 The Golden Stork, Bierkade 22 (tram 16 (Bierkade stop)), \u260f +31 70 415 8959, info@thegoldenstork.com.

You need to pay a deposit of \u20ac10 also for your room card (the door keys are RFID based) which is returned upon departure. If you book, remember that The Hague charges a tourist tax (Toeristenbelasting) of \u20ac5.20 per night, which is not included in the cost of your stay - you have to pay that on arrival. Since 2020, the Golden Stork has been an age restricted hostel, accepting guests only between the ages of 18 and 40. \u20ac20 - 30 per night. (updated Oct 2017)\n\n\nMid-range\n6 Mercure Den Haag Centraal, Spui 180, \u260f +31 70 2039002, H1317@accor.com. The main upside for staying at the Mercure is actually not having to see the outside of the building, which is an ugly block clad in blueish plastic. Otherwise, this Mercure is a business-oriented hotel with very modern appointments and a brilliantly central location, not leaving much to be desired - and charging for that appropriately. \n7 NH Den Haag, Prinses Margrietplantsoen 100, \u260f +31 70 3812345. Located at the heart of the Beatrixkwartier business district and within some distance from the old town and most tourist attractions. That said, being right at the tram stop within the spectacular Netkous, getting from it to any place in the city should not be a problem. It is one of the few hotels in the city located in a tall tower, so you can choose a room on one of the upper floors and enjoy sweeping vistas. From \u20ac89. \n8 Novotel Den Haag Centrum, Hofweg 5-7. Located in the Passage shopping centre and right across the street from the Binnenhof. \n9 Novotel Suites Den Haag City Centre, Grote Marktstraat 46, \u260f +31 70 8505180, H7320@accor.com.

Like Hilton The Hague, this hotel is located in the Willemspark, a fitting environment for this quiet, elegant boutique hotel with its tasteful interior and superb service. \n14 Crowne Plaza The Hague - Promenade, Van Stolkweg 1, \u260f +31 70 3525161, fax: +31 70 3541046, info@promenadedenhaag.nl. Check-in: 14:00, check-out: 12:00. The Crowne Plaza is in the middle of the woodlands separating The Hague proper from Scheveningen, and thus a tram ride from either, but a short stroll from most of the international institutions located in The Hague and the Madurodam. \n\n\nStay safe\nYou should take normal precautions against pickpockets and baggage theft, especially in the main shopping streets, in trams and trains, at stations, and anywhere where tourists congregate. Street begging is common around the Hollands Spoor train station and at the Grote Markt. Most of them are homeless and non-aggressive,  just give them some money or simple 'no' will be enough. At night, the city centre is quite safe because of the large number of police cameras monitoring this area. Neighbourhoods southwest of the centre are less affluent and may not be as safe. The area between Zuiderpark and Hollands Spoor has a bad reputation due to the increasing number of street gangs. Schilderswijk and Transvaal areas are blocks that should be avoided after dark. If you are unsure, take a taxi to your destination. Taking a tram is also considered safe, as the so-called 'risky lines' in this area now have a security team on board from 20:00 till 01:00.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nEmbassies\n\n\nGo next\nQuaint cities like Delft, known for its famous blue pottery, and the university town of Leiden are just 15 minutes by train.\n\nScheveningen - Closest sea resort to the city.\n3 Wassenaar.
