  "extract": "Mulhouse is an industrial city in Alsace, France west of the Rhine near the border to Germany.  Thanks to its history, cultural heritage, geographic location, and a plethora of investments made to gentrify neighbourhoods, rehabilitate public transportation, and new stores, the city is slowly by surely getting out of its dark ages.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nFew cities in France can claim to be as industrial as Mulhouse. Regarded as the French Manchester, Mulhouse's history has ebbed and flowed with the rise and fall of various industries. Up until the 1970s it was among France's wealthiest cities. But as heavy industry began its inevitable decline, so did Mulhouse. Not unlike the north of England and the American Rust Belt, the city fell on hard times, with surging crime and unemployment rates. \nAfter decades of decline, Mulhouse has started to re-emerge on the national scene as of 2020, though the seeds of the city's renaissance were planted since the 2000s.\n\n\nTourist information\nMulhouse Tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nMulhouse is on the main line from Paris to Basel, and is also served by long-distance TGV services from Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur to Switzerland, Germany, and Luxembourg, and medium-distance TER services from Strasbourg. There are also local international services to M\u00fcllheim in Germany, for connections to Freiburg and Karlsruhe. For ticket purchase, see the SNCF.\n1 Gare de Mulhouse.   (updated Sep 2018)\n\n\nBy bus\n2 Bus stop. Drop off point for all major bus operators: FlixBus and ALSA (updated Sep 2018)\n\n\nBy car\nThe city is at the crossroads of the Paris-Germany and Strasbourg-Basel motorways, so you can easily arrive by car.\n\n\nBy plane\nThe closest airport, EuroAirport (MLH IATA) is some 25 km south and serves Mulhouse, Basel and Freiburg. To reach the city from the airport by public transport, take bus 11 to Saint Louis railway station (\u20ac2.50) and then a local train to Mulhouse (\u20ac7.50). The train only runs hourly outside of business hours.\nBe sure to leave the airport by the \"Exit to France\" exit to get to Mulhouse.\nOther airports within a two-hour drive include Strasbourg Airport, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, and Z\u00fcrich Airport.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy tram and bus\nThe city centre and major suburbs are linked by a three-line tram system. Other parts of the city are served by a bus network, although bus routes may be less frequent and have more limited operating hours. Both are operated by SOLEA. A single fare is \u20ac1.50, a carnet of ten single tickets is \u20ac13.40, a day-pass \u20ac4.30, and a three-day pass \u20ac8.20. There is also a tram-train service, extending certain journeys on route 3 onto the railway line to Thann.\n\n\nSee\n1 Place de la R\u00e9union. The main square of the old town of Mulhouse. Major buildings include the Temple (Protestant Church) of St. Etienne, popularly nicknamed the \"cathedral\", and the old town hall. The Temple was constructed in the 19th century, although it looks much older, and incorporates stained glass and furnishings from the medieval building that it replaced. The former town hall, which houses the city historical museum (free entry), is notable for its elaborate mock-marble trompe d'oeil painted decoration.  (updated Mar 2018)\nThe old town. The mostly-pedestrianised old town is not as picturesque as some others in Alsace, as it was mainly stone rather than timber-framed, and it was severely damaged during World War II. However, it still includes some attractive old buildings, most significantly the Cour des Chaines, a 16th-century townhouse now used as an arts centre.\n2 The New Quarter. Centred on the Place de la Republique, the New Quarter was constructed between the old town and the canal (and later railway) in the early 19th century to house important business institutions and the homes of newly wealthy industrial families.

Beggars can be a nuisance, but you don't have to give them anything; they won't harm you. In the unlikely event that you should find yourself in trouble, call 112 free from any payphone or from your mobile.\n\n\nGo next\nYou can continue your trip to the wine-growing areas of Alsace, or the other major Alsatian cities of Colmar and Strasbourg.\nFor fans of French-made cars, the Peugeot museum is located at the PSA factories in Souchaux near Montb\u00e9liard about 40 km from Mulhouse.\nGermany and Switzerland are both reached in half an hour by car. The nearest major cities are Basel and Freiburg.\nThe Black Forest is a relatively short distance across the German border.",
