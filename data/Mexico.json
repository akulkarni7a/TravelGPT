  "extract": "Mexico (Spanish: M\u00e9xico) is known for its cuisine, art, archaeology, history, pyramids, music, museums, haciendas, 9,600 km (6,000 mi) of shoreline, superb architecture, weather from snow-capped mountains in the Sierras to rainy jungles in the southeast and desert in the northwest, many golf courses and excellent fishing. Along with Chile, Colombia, and Peru, this once-poor nation is one of the Pacific Pumas, seeing significant economic growth and improved infrastructure during the 21st century.\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Mexico City \u2013 Capital of the republic, one of the three largest cities in the world, and a sophisticated urban hub with a 700-year history. In Mexico City, you will find everything from parks, Aztec ruins, colonial architecture, museums, to nightlife and shopping.\n2 Canc\u00fan \u2013 One of the world's most popular and famous beaches, known for its clear Caribbean waters, its lively party atmosphere, and its wealth of recreational facilities. During the U.S. college Spring Break (mid-Feb to the end of March) it is noted for drinking, sunburns, and debauchery.\n3 Guadalajara \u2013 A traditional city, capital of Jalisco state, and the home of mariachi music and tequila. Guadalajara is blessed with perpetual spring weather and its colonial downtown is graceful and sophisticated.\n4 Mazatlan \u2013 Lively Pacific coast town, Mazatlan is a shipping port, a transportation hub with ferries to Baja California, and a beach resort destination with miles of sandy shore. It is a popular U.S. college Spring Break destination due to its variety of affordable lodging options.\n5 Monterrey \u2013 A large modern city that is the commercial and industrial hub of Northern Mexico. Monterrey enjoys a dry, mountainous setting and is known for its high-quality educational and transportation infrastructure.\n6 San Luis Potosi \u2013 A colonial city in central Mexico that was once an important silver producer, but today, relies on manufacturing for its economic base.\n7 Taxco \u2013 In central Mexico west of Cuernavaca, this steep mountain town was once a major silver producer, and now has a strong place in the trade of decorative silver, from cheap fittings to the most elegant jewelry and elaborate castings.\n8 Tijuana \u2013 Mexico's busiest border crossing for pedestrians and private vehicles, and a long-time bargain Mecca for southern Californians due to its proximity to San Diego.\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Copper Canyon (Barrancas del Cobre) \u2013 An exotic destination for travelers looking for a unique remote adventure! An awesome mountain rail ride -- one of the greatest in the world -- takes you upwards over 2,440 m (8000 feet) on the CHEPE, the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railway. Hiking, horseback riding, birding, and Tarahumara Indians. Copper Canyon, the Sierra Madre and the Chihuahuan desert of Mexico. This area is designed for adventurous individuals who will tolerate some rough travel to get to their points of interest (although the famous train ride isn't demanding at all). Copper Canyon, a magnificent remote wilderness is not likely ever to become a mass market destination.\n2 Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California)  \u2013 See whale birthings, swim with dolphins, and sea kayak in the warm waters of the Sea of Cortez, along the eastern coast of Baja California, near La Paz. National Geographic says the sunsets at San Carlos are some of the most spectacular in the world.\n3 Monarch Butterfly Reserves \u2013 Protected natural areas in the highlands of the state of Michoac\u00e1n. Millions of butterflies come to the area between November and March of each year, although numbers have declined sharply. This is a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n4 Sumidero Canyon \u2013 From docks on the Rio Grijalva (the only major river within Mexico) near Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez in Chiapas state, tour launches take you into this steep-walled National Park. You'll likely see vast flocks of flamingos, pelicans, and other waterfowl, as well as crocodiles.\n Mexico national parks - Mexico has 67 national parks; these include protected natural areas and national monuments and historical sites\n\n\nArchaeological sites\n\n5 Chichen Itza \u2013 Majestic Mayan city, declared a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 and was voted as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n6 Ek Balam \u2013 A reconstructed Mayan site, famous for its unique decorated stucco and stone-carved temples that you can climb.\n7 El Taj\u00edn \u2013 In the state of Veracruz near the town of Papantla. A  UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n8 Monte Alban \u2013 In the state of Oaxaca, a Zapotec site dating from about 500 BC. A  UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n9 Palenque \u2013 Mayan city in the state of Chiapas, Palenque famous for its elaborate paintings. Also well known for having the largest tract of rainforest in Mexico located in the same area.\n10 Teotihuacan \u2013 An enormous pre-Columbian site with several large pyramids  near Mexico City.\n11 Tulum  \u2013 Mayan coastal city with spectacular Caribbean vistas. Dates from late Mayan period.\n12 Uxmal \u2013 Impressive Mayan city-state in the Puuc Region, declared a  UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\n\n\nSmall towns\nThe Mexican government has designated more than 100 scenic small towns as Pueblos M\u00e1gicos. States can apply to have towns added to the carefully curated list, but they must provide sites of genuine tourist value (historical or cultural) and guarantee adequate levels of tourism infrastructure. All Pueblos Magicos are within a few hours drive of a major city that has good airline connections. Some of the Pueblos Magicos (such as Tequila) are well-known and quite popular. Most are off the beaten path and offer rich opportunities for quiet exploration.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nMexico, the United Mexican States (Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos), is one of the most visited countries in the world. Much of the tourist industry is centered around the beach resorts as well as the altiplano in the central part of the country. Visiting the northern interior allows visitors to get off the beaten path a bit. U.S. American tourists tend to predominate on the Baja California peninsula and the more modernized beach resorts (Canc\u00fan, Puerto Vallarta), while European tourists congregate around the smaller resort areas in the south like Playa del Carmen and colonial towns San Cristobal de las Casas. Canadians often favor smaller beach resorts like Huatulco or Ixtapa.\n\n\nClimate\nMexico uses the metric system for all measurements. All weather forecasts are in Celsius (\u00b0C).\n\n\nCentral and southern Mexico\nApril is already the hottest month, especially at the coast and on the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. Towns which aren't that hot in April and during the summer are Mexico City, Toluca/Metepec, San Cristobal de las Casas, Pachuca and Zacatecas.\nHurricanes can be common in the coastal cities specially those near the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\nNorthern Mexico\nIt gets rather cold during the winter except on the coast. There is sometimes snow in certain places like the Sierra Madre of Chihuahua, Durango, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and northern Tamaulipas. \nNorthern Mexico gets very hot during the summer with sudden violent storms in the afternoon, with heavy rain and hail. The temperatures during the day can exceed 39\u00b0C (100\u00b0F). Less hot during the summer is Tijuana.\n\n\nLandscape\n\nHigh, rugged mountains; low coastal plains; high plateaus; temperate plains with grasslands and Mezquite trees in the northeast, desert and even more rugged mountains in the northwest, tropical rainforests in the south and southeast Chiapas, Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula semiarid in places like Aguascalientes, San Luis Potos\u00ed and temperate coniferous and deciduous forests in the central part of the country Mexico City, Toluca.\n\n\nHolidays\nActual non-working days may shift to the Monday before the holiday, so check an up-to-date calendar.   Government offices are closed nationwide on official holidays and on election days.\n\n\nTime\n\nThe 24-hour clock system has traditionally been used for time keeping. Today, both the 24-hour clock and the 12-hour clock are commonly used (roughtly equally), though the younger generation seems more inclined to express times using the 12-hour clock. \nMexico uses the same four time zones as the contiguous United States, but three of them are only used in peripheral parts of the country.\n\nNorthwest Zone (UTC\u22128, corresponds to U.S. Pacific Time): Baja California (state)\nPacific Zone (UTC\u22127, corresponds to U.S. Mountain Time): Baja California Sur, Chihuahua (state), Nayarit, Sinaloa, Sonora\nCentral Zone (UTC\u22126, corresponds to U.S. Central Time): The rest of the country, except Quintana Roo\nSoutheastern Zone (UTC\u22125, corresponds to U.S. Eastern Time): Quintana Roo\nMost of Mexico is on standard time year round. Daylight savings time was discontinued nationally as of October 2022, with some exceptions. Communities on the U.S. border, except in Sonora, do observe DST on the U.S. schedule. The entire state of Baja California also observes DST on the U.S. schedule (but Baja California Sur does not). The state of Sonora south of Arizona, does not observe DST and neither do its border towns because Arizona doesn't observe DST either.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nPre-Columbian\nSee also: Indigenous cultures of North America, Indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica\nAmong the earliest complex civilizations in Mexico was the Olmec culture that flourished on the Gulf Coast in 1500 BCE. Olmec culture diffused through Mexico into formative era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico.\nIn Central Mexico the height of the classical period saw the ascendancy of Teotihuacan, which formed a military and commercial empire. It had the largest structures of pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas.\nDuring the early post-classic Mexico was dominated by Toltec culture, and the lowland Maya had important areas at Calakmul and Chichen Itza. At the end of the post-Classical period, the Aztecs built a tributary empire covering most of Central Mexico. The Mesoamerican cultural traditions ended in the 16th century and over the next centuries, Mexican indigenous cultures were under Spanish colonial rule. However, contrary to popular misconceptions neither the Maya nor the Aztec culture ever entirely \"disappeared\" and to this day many Mexicans trace at least part of their heritage to indigenous roots and language such as Nahuatl and numerous Maya tongues are still spoken by hundreds of thousands or even millions of Mexicans. Indigenous elements are visible even today in loanwords in Mexican Spanish, traditional dress, Mexican cuisine, architecture and even religious observances (nominally \"catholic\" to varying degrees). The eagle and the snake on a cactus depicted on the Mexican flag, for example, refers to an Aztec legend about the founding of Tenochtitlan, the city that now is Mexico City.\n\n\nColonial and early independence\nMain article: Colonial Mexico\nMexico remained under Spanish colonial rule until 1821 when it declared independence under the terms of \"Plan of Iguala\". After the short lived Mexican empire of 1821-1823 (former Spanish general and independence hero Augustin de Iturbide briefly declared himself emperor but was overthrown after two years) Mexico became a republic with a fragile balance of powers between liberals (allied mostly with urban merchants) and conservatives (allied with the church and big landholders) and Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna became president several times while also being overthrown by his opponents several times thus having eight non-consecutive terms as president as well as five \"permanent\" exiles.\n\n\nIndependent Mexico\nMain article: Mexican War of Independence\nThe early Mexican state was anything but stable. Texas (under the leadership of US-American immigrants who wanted to make Texas a slave-holding state of the US) and Yucat\u00e1n seceded at several points. Maya rebels fought against both the Yucat\u00e1n independence movement and the federal government in the so-called \"Caste war\".\nAfter Texas gained de facto independence a disagreement as to its southern border (the Nueces river as claimed by Mexico or the Rio Grande as claimed by Texas) led to the involvement of the US in a brief war that ended in a devastating defeat for Mexico (the line about the \"halls of Montezuma\" in the marines' song refers to the presidential palace in Mexico city that was conquered by the US) and the loss of Alta California (now the US state of California), Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico as well as the definite loss of Texas north of the Rio Grande.\nThe ceded territories were rapidly colonized by immigrants from Europe and the eastern United States; see Old West.\n\n\nFrench intervention and Second Mexican empire\nMain article: Post-Independence Mexico\nIn 1861, when president Benito Juarez suspended the payment of Mexico's debt, France decided to invade the country in order to regain some or all of its money. This was only possible because the United States, which had declared in its Monroe Doctrine that it wouldn't tolerate any European intervention in the sovereign states of the Americas, started its Civil War that same year. After overthrowing the government (though Mexican resistance against the occupiers never ceased) the French installed a Habsburg prince as emperor Maximilian I to act as their puppet. While the Mexican monarchy had some support among conservatives its days were numbered when the French troops were withdrawn after the end of the American Civil war, and in 1867, Maximilian was executed by firing squad. Cinco de Mayo, which in the US is often mistaken to be \"Mexican independence day\", is celebrated in remembrance of the battle of Puebla that occurred during the French occupation and was decisively won by Mexican republican forces.\n\n\nBenito Ju\u00e1rez\n\nBenito Ju\u00e1rez was the first president of indigenous descent in all of Latin America and is one very few figures that is still almost exclusively seen as a positive figure in Mexican history. He was president from 1858 to 1864 and again from 1867 to his death in 1872. His saying \"el respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz\" (respect for the rights of others is peace) is still frequently quoted.\n\n\nPorfirio D\u00edaz\nPorfirio D\u00edaz, a general during the French intervention rose to power shortly after the death of Ju\u00e1rez and ruled Mexico from 1876 to 1911. While initially willing and able to reform and modernize the country, the sheer length of his reign and his corruption led to a lot of unhappiness about his government and in 1911 the Mexican revolution broke out to unseat him from power, but it soon devolved into factional fighting between various claimants for power and attempts at radical social and economic reform.\n\n\nThe Mexican Revolution\nMain article: Mexican Revolution\nThe Mexican Revolution was a complex civil war and period of political intrigue and treachery. The Revolution started in 1910 with resistance against a blatantly fraudulent election manipulated by Porfirio D\u00edaz. The Revolution really ignited into full-scale war when the elected president (Madero) was assassinated by D\u00edaz loyalists. Several factions had different complaints about D\u00edaz and his corrupt, never-ending dictatorship. Groups loyal to Venustiano Carranza wanted constitutional reforms. Groups loyal to Emiliano Zapata wanted land reforms and rights for the indigenous. Other groups demanded an end to resource giveaways to foreign industrial interests, while others demanded an end to excessive power of the Catholic church. The groups eventually coalesced behind the Constitutionalists and stable government was restored by 1920.\n\n\nUnder the PRI\nMain article: Modern Mexico\nOnce the dust of the revolution had settled the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI [pronounced /pree/] for its Spanish name) became the dominant political force and all presidents before the early 1990s were members of the PRI. They did not establish a one party state and other parties were still legal and participated in elections. However, the success of the PRI candidate (especially at the federal level) was almost always a given. As such, political power struggles mostly took place within the PRI, with more conservative or left wing factions gaining the upper hand from time to time. In 1988, during a presidential election that was actually close for the first time in decades, a computer that counted the votes supposedly crashed. The words with which this was announced \"se cay\u00f3 el sistema\" are noted for their ambiguity as they can mean either \"the computer broke down\" or \"the (political) system fell\". Nonetheless, according to the official result (which was and still is doubted by many), the PRI candidate won a six-year term in office just narrowly surpassing the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff election. In 2000 the PRI finally lost its first presidential election when Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) won a narrow victory in a three-way race. In 2006 the PAN won again with Felipe Calderon being elected president but in 2012 the PRI returned to power with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who promised to end the drug war being elected to the presidency. Whether this proves temporary or the PRI has indeed regained its once dominant status, remains yet to be seen.\n\n\nMexico today\nMain article: Modern Mexico\nDespite problems such as corruption and the drug war in the North (with some areas under de facto control of different cartels), Mexico has grown steadily, and there have been democratic multiparty elections with peaceful transition of power. A fairly stable three party system has emerged: the PAN (conservative) and PRI (centrist, catch all, sometimes leftist) have each won the presidency several times and the PRD (left of the PRI) has been a serious contender in almost all elections.\nThe drug war is ongoing and some parts of the country are not entirely safe, but the situation has bettered a lot after the 2000s. Generally the North with cities such as Ciudad Juarez notorious for their violence is more dangerous than the south and Yucat\u00e1n is among the safest regions in Latin America. For more on the effects of the drug war see the stay safe section of this article and the individual region articles.\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) assumed power on December 1, 2018, after waging a populist, anti-corruption campaign and winning the 2018 election with more than a 30% margin over his next closest opponent. He is the leader of the center-left National Regeneration Movement (MORENA). Having had a reputation as a leftist firebrand in the past, AMLO has moderated his politics in order to appeal to a wider share of the electorate, though he remains a solidly left-leaning, populist politician. Under his leadership, Mexico has served as a moderator in wider Latin American politics, for example, in the Venezuelan and Bolivian crises, while also navigating relations with the United States government over trade and migrant issues. In 2024, Mexico elected Claudia Sheinbaum as its first female and first Jewish president to succeed AMLO.\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Mexico website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nVisa and other entrance requirements\n\nAccording to the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores), certain foreign nationals who intend to stay in Mexico fewer than 180 days for the purpose of tourism or 30 days for business can fill out a tourist card at the border or upon landing at an airport after presenting a valid passport, for US$22. If arriving via air, it is included in the price of the fare. This service is available to citizens of Andorra, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Malaysia, Malta, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, United States of America and Uruguay (see official list here). Permanent residents of the United States, Canada, Japan, United Kingdom, and Schengen area countries are also eligible for visas on arrival regardless of citizenship.\nThe Mexican tourist card is a Forma Migratoria M\u00faltiple (Multiple Immigration Form), or FMM. It has a perforation that divides the card into two parts, of which the right side asks for some of the same information requested on the left side. At entry, after reviewing your passport and filled-out FMM, the immigration officer will stamp your passport and the FMM, separate the FMM along the perforation and give the right side of the FMM back to you with your passport.\nKeep the FMM with your passport at all times. It is your responsibility to make sure the right side of the FMM is returned to the Mexican government at time of departure so that the bar code can be scanned, thus showing that you left the country on time. For example, if you are flying with Aeromexico, they will ask for your passport and FMM at check-in for your flight home, then staple your FMM to your boarding pass. You are expected to then hand the boarding pass together with your FMM to the gate agent as you board your flight. If you lose your FMM during your visit to Mexico, you may be subject to substantial delays and fines before you can leave the country.\nElectronic Authorization System (SAE, Autorizaci\u00f3n Electr\u00f3nica) for travelling to Mexico is available on the Internet for nationals from Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Russians, Ukrainians, and Turkish citizens with permanent residency or a valid visa to Canada, the US, Japan, the UK, or any Schengen country don't need an SAE. Other nationalities must contact a Mexican consulate in order to find out the requirements for citizens of their country, and may have to apply for and obtain a visa in advance of travel. If you are in need of other information, Mexico has diplomatic offices in the following cities around the world. The consulates in the USA are typically open for business to non-citizens (by telephone or in-person) only from 08:30 to 12:30.\nIf you cross the border via road, do not expect the authorities to automatically signal you to fill out your paperwork. You will have to locate the border office yourself.\nThe immigration officer at your point of entry into Mexico can request that you demonstrate that you have sufficient economic solvency. \nThe immigration officer can demand a round trip ticket. Be advised if you only booked a one-way ticket to Mexico: The airline may want to see a ticket that carries you out of Mexico, especially when flying from an equally or less developed country than Mexico \u2013 also if your passport is from a highly industrialized nation. It could be that the airline wants to see that onward ticket as \"early\" as at the gate, where you may not have enough time to buy one. So have at least an onward ticket from specialized websites for around US$10 (Nov 2021) ready when heading to the airport for your flight for Mexico.\nIf you do not intend to travel past the \"border zone\" and your stay does not exceed three days, U.S. and Canadian nationals require only a proof of citizenship. Reentry into the United States generally requires a passport, but a U.S. or Canadian Enhanced Drivers License (or Enhanced Photo ID) or U.S. passport card is acceptable for reentry by land or sea.\n\n\nBy plane\n\n\nFrom the United States and Canada\nThere are hundreds of daily flights linking Mexico to cities large and small throughout North America. This includes legacy carriers such as Air Canada, Aeromexico, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta, and discount airlines such as JetBlue, Spirit, WestJet, and Southwest Airlines. Also to be considered are the Mexican discount carriers Volaris, which operate from several major US cities through their hubs in Mexico City and Guadalajara, and Viva Aerobus, which also operates from several major US cities through hubs in Mexico City and Monterrey.  United Airlines/United Express fly to many smaller market Mexican cities and resort areas, including Aguascaliente, Chihuahua, Ciudad de Carmen, Durango, Huatulco, Leon/Guanajuato, Oaxaca, Merida, San Luis Potosi, Torreon, Tampico, Veracruz and Villahermosa. \nAs in the United States and Canada, you will have to clear immigration and customs at your first Mexican port of entry, even though that airport may not be your final destination. (For example, many trips on Aeromexico will involve connecting through its Mexico City hub.) You will then have to re-check your bags and go through security again to proceed to your next flight segment.\n\n\nFrom Australia or New Zealand\nFly from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne or Auckland (NZ) direct to Los Angeles on American Airlines, Delta, Qantas, and United. Air New Zealand offers one-stop air service from Australia and non-stop air service from Auckland to Los Angeles. Hawaiian Airlines and Air Tahiti Nui offer one- or two-stop air service to Los Angeles from Australia and New Zealand.\nMany airlines continue from Los Angeles to Mexico including AeroMexico/Aeromexico Connect, Alaska Airlines, Volaris, United and Virgin America, some of which have interline or alliance ticketing and baggage check through. More options are available if connecting through another US city. Also, make sure to have a good look at visas beforehand \u2013 even just for transit you will need something for the US, and if you get a visa waiver, they treat Mexico as part of the US, meaning if you stay longer than 90 days in Mexico, you will need to travel further south before returning to the US.\n\n\nFrom Europe\nMost commercial airlines link Mexico directly from Europe. There are direct flights to Mexico City (MEX IATA) and Cancun (CUN IATA) from Paris (CDG IATA), London (LON IATA), Madrid (MAD IATA), Amsterdam (AMS IATA), and Frankfurt (FRA IATA). Some carriers will serve both Mexico City and Cancun while others will only serve one and not the other (usually only to Cancun such as those from Russia and Italy). Additional flights to Cancun from Europe may only be available as charters and some may operate during the winter months (December\u2013February) only. It is always worth to compare flight offers from air carriers and charter companies who can bring you to Mexico City or Cancun via many European hubs. The flight duration from those cities is always approximately 11 hours.\n\n\nBy train\nFrom the United States to Mexico the nearest Amtrak stations are in San Diego, Yuma, Del Rio and El Paso. The frequent Pacific Surfliner connects San Diego from San Luis Obispo via Los Angeles; while the Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle pass by Yuma, El Paso and Del Rio between Los Angeles and San Antonio. In San Antonio the Texas Eagle continues northwards towards Chicago while the Sunset Limited continues east to New Orleans. Amtrak trains do not cross the border into Mexico so passengers continue to the border by local public transportation or by taxi from the Amtrak station.\nThe Tren Maya has a station along the Belize border in the city of Chetumal. Buses are available there for onward travel to Merida, Canc\u00fan or other destinations in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The Tren Maya also has two stops near the Guatemala border (at El Triunfo and at Boca del Cerro), but neither have scheduled transportation to any Guatemalan destinations.\n\n\nBy car\n\nAmerican automobile insurance is not accepted in Mexico; however, it is easy to obtain short-term or long-term tourist policies that include the mandatory liability coverage, theft and accident coverage for your vehicle, and often, legal assistance coverage. Should you decide to drive to Mexico, the Transport and Communications Secretariat website has free downloadable road maps.\nForeign-plated vehicles must obtain necessary permits before being allowed into the interior of Mexico. This can be done at the border checkpoints by showing your vehicle title or registration, as well as immigration documents and a valid credit card. It is now possible to apply for your vehicle import permit online. Vehicle permits will only be issued to the registered owner of the vehicle, so the papers will have to be in the name of the applicant. The Baja California peninsula and the northern part of the State of Sonora do not require a permit.\nDriving a rental car from the United States into Mexico is possible with some of the large multinational companies, but the process is rather cumbersome. You will need to inform your car rental company in advance and purchase additional Mexican insurance (since U.S. car insurance does not cover Mexico), and you cannot drive beyond the border region into the interior of Mexico. You also cannot drop off a U.S. rental car in Mexico, and must return to the U.S. to drop it off. In the reverse direction, Mexican rental cars are usually not permitted to be driven into the U.S.\nDue to the contraband crossing the US-Mexico border (drugs and illegal immigration into the US, drug money and weapons into Mexico), expect long delays and thorough searches of vehicles when crossing the border. At some of the busiest crossings, expect a waiting time of 1\u20133 hours.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe Mexican bus system is reportedly the most efficient in the world. Buses are without a doubt the backbone of personal intercity transport in Mexico as private car ownership is a lot lower than in its neighbor to the north and trains mostly serve cargo and tourism purposes. Chances are, you will meet a lot of locals, traveling by bus. Rates by distance are generally comparable to those of Greyhound in the U.S., but there are more departures and the system serves much smaller villages than its American counterpart. There are many bus companies based in Mexico with branch offices in major U.S. cities with a few such examples noted below:\n\nEstrella Roja Connects Puebla to Mexico city.\nAutobuses De Oriente (ADO), Omnibus Cristobal Colon (OCC), Autobus Unidos (AU) Connects the USA border from Matamoros to the interior of Mexico along the gulf coast and once nightly buses from Cancun and Merida to Belize City (two separate routes). At other times passengers connect to onward buses to Belize in Chetumal and to Guatemala in Tapachula, Palenque and Ciudad Cuauht\u00e9moc near the Guatemalan border in Chiapas.\nOmnibus Mexicanos, Noreste, Omnibus Express Offers intrastate travel from the border areas to several cities within the U.S. state of Texas and from Texas to Georgia, North Carolina and Florida as Omnibus Express\nAutobus Americanos -- co-brand between Grupo Estrella Blanca  and Greyhound Lines for cross border travel between the U.S. and Mexico.\nGreyhound Mexico Connects Monterrey to Laredo, TX via Nuevo Laredo. They also operate Cruceros-USA connecting Tijuana to Los Angeles via San Diego and Santa Ana.\nGreyhound offers tickets from the US to major Mexican cities with Grupo Estrella Blanca further south of the border, including Monterrey, Quer\u00e9taro, Durango, Mazatlan, Torreon, Guadalajara and Mexico City. It is best (and cheapest) to buy a round-trip Greyhound ticket since it may be more difficult and expensive to buy a ticket from Mexico to a US destination which is not a major city. When departing from Mexico, the local bus line (usually Futura) will change the Greyhound-issued ticket into its own, free of charge.\nEl Expresso Houston-based bus company that connects cities and towns in Mexico bordering Texas to Florida, the Southeastern part of the U.S. and to Chicago from several cities in Texas.\nTurimex Internacional Subsidiary of Grupo Senda for onward connections to Florida, the Southeastern part of the U.S. and to Chicago via Texas.\nTAP Royal A subsidiary of TAP connecting Tijuana and Nogales to Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas.\nTUFESA Connects Sinaloa, Sonora and Baja California in northwestern Mexico to multiple cities in California, Arizona, Utah and to Las Vegas NV via Los Angeles and Phoenix .\nEl Paso-Los Angeles Limousines and Los Limousines Travels the I-10 corridor along the American side of the border from El Paso to Los Angeles and from El Paso towards Denver via Las Cruces NM along I-10 and I-25. Goes south from El Paso towards Torreon via Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua City, etc. along Fed Hwy 45 as Los Limousines.\nLos Paisanos Connects El Paso to several cities in California, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri. They also have direct service from El Paso to Phoenix, Roswell NM and Caldwell ID in the U.S. The same company also offer service from El Paso to several cities in Chihuahua state, Zacatecas state and Queretaro in Mexico.\nA ticket to a major Mexican city from the southwestern U.S. can be bought for US$60 round trip (San Antonio TX to Monterrey N.L.). These companies, however, cater mostly to Hispanics or Mexican Nationals living in the U.S. and operate mostly in Spanish.\nIn Mexico City (main transportation hub), buses from the U.S. border arrive at Terminal Norte. Buses going to Chiapas and Quintana Roo leave from both Terminal de Autobuses de Pasajeros de Oriente (TAPO) and Terminal Norte (same as U.S. bound buses). If going between bus stations, there are ticket desks for taxis at all bus stations where passengers can buy a ticket for a sitio taxi to transfer to the next bus station. Likewise if passengers are traveling light they can also use the metro which serves all major bus stations for a fraction of the taxi fare.\nOnward connections to/from Guatemala through Tapachula and to Belize through Chetumal. There are additional connections (by shuttle) between San Cristobal de las Casas and Antigua Guatemala (via Comitan, crossing through Ciudad Cuauht\u00e9moc/La Mesilla). The tickets on these shuttles are purchased from one of many agents in San Cristobal de las Casas. Passengers typically change vehicles at the border. The following offer regular first class pullman services out of Tapachula to Central America:\n\n Ticabus, La Terminal OCC 17a Calle Ote #45 (Along Calle 17a Ote between 1a Ave Nte y 3a Ave Nte), \u260f +52 962 625-2435.

US$17. \n\n\nBy boat\nBorder crossing from Guatemala.\nCruise ships from the United States.\n\n\nGet around\nTravelling in Mexico is most practical by bus, car, or air. Passenger transport by train is possible in some areas. most extensively in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, with its modern Tren Maya service.  The Chihuahua del Pacifico railroad is one of the most scenic railroads in the world, passing through the Copper Canyon, and departing from Los Mochis on the Pacific coast, or Creel in the east.  They cross each other roughly midways at Divisadero and Barrancas Copper Canyon stations at an altitude of 2100 m (7000 ft).\n\n\nBy car\nMain article: Driving in Mexico\n\nDue to a government scheme in the early 1990s to create infrastructure, the best roads are toll roads. Toll roads can be relatively costly but are much faster and better maintained. First-class buses generally travel by toll roads (and the toll is included in the ticket price).\nUS vehicle insurance is not valid in Mexico. Mexican auto insurance has been required since 2018; if you have even a minor accident without insurance, you could land in jail. MexiPass and AAA offer Mexican auto insurance.\nWhen traveling on Mexican roads, especially near the borders with the United States and Guatemala, one will probably encounter several checkpoints operated by the Mexican Army searching for illegal weapons and drugs. If you are coming from the United States, you may not be used to this, and it can be intimidating. However, these are rarely a problem for honest people. Simply do what the soldiers tell you to do, and treat them with respect. The best way to show respect when entering a checkpoint is to turn your music down, lift sunglasses from your face, and be prepared to roll your window down. They should treat you with respect as well, and they usually do. If you are asked to unpack any part of your vehicle, do so without complaint. It is their right to make you completely unload in order for them to inspect your cargo.\nTourists are often warned about travelling on roads at night. Although bandidos are rare in more metropolitan areas, err on the side of caution in more rural areas. The best bet is to drive during only daylight hours. Cattle, dogs, and other animals also can appear on the roadway unexpectedly, so if you do have to drive at night, be very cautious. If possible, follow a bus or truck that seems to be driving safely.\nForeign drivers' licenses are recognized and recommended. Speeding tickets are common, and to ensure your presence at the hearing, the officer may choose to keep your license. He is within his rights to do so. Beware though, police officers are known to keep driver's licenses until they are given a bribe.\nAt petrol (gas) stations, make sure the pump is zeroed out before the attendant begins pumping your gas so that you don't end up paying more than you should.\nGood maps are invaluable and the Mexico maps included in \"North American Road Atlas\" books are worse than useless. The Guia Roji maps are particularly good.\nIf you arrive in Mexico by airplane but would like to drive around the country, all major car rental companies are present in Mexico. However, you must know that they operate under a franchise scheme, and therefore their policies and the overall way to do business are very different than those in other countries. Most of the times they will publish prices that may look very attractive, but may not include insurance, taxes and other mandatory fees, the best thing to do is call in advance to find out the final price to pay. There are some local companies which do include all bells and whistles in their rates, Veico Car Rental. City Car Rental offers good prices and have rental offices as most major cities in Mexico.\nThroughout the mainland of North America including the Mexico, traffic moves on the right with most cars being left-hand-drive (as in Belize, Guatemala, and the United States of America).  The only areas of North America that do not drive on the right are on some Caribbean Islands.\n\n\nBy plane\nMajor airlines hubs for all or several of the airlines are in Mexico City-Benito Juarez Airport, Mexico City-Santa Lucia Airport (NLU), Guadalajara, Canc\u00fan International Airport, and Monterrey. There are additional point to point services from several other cities. Budget airlines offer competitive fares that rival bus travel over long distances.

The airline operates on a hub and spoke model with all flights originating or ending at Mexico City - Aeropuerto Internacional Felipe Angeles (AIFA) (NLU IATA) in the northern suburb of Santa Lucia. Additional routes will be added via a second hub at Tulum International Airport (TQO IATA) in early 2024. (updated Nov 2023)\n VivaAerobus.

As of Nov 2021, the website and app won't tell you that if you try it earlier. Instead giving you a random error message or telling you to check-in at the airport for additional cost, which is not needed.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n\nIntercity buses\nFor going from one city to another, the apps of CheckMyBus and Busbud show the departure times and the according bus company.\nIf traveling by bus, be sure to take the express (first class) buses (directo, sin escalas, primera clase), if available. First class buses are usually direct routes and are the best option for most. These buses are comfortable, have washrooms/toilets and will generally show movies, which may or may not be in English with Spanish subtitles (or vice versa). Others may even offer a drink and a little snack. First class buses travel over longer distances between cities use toll freeways where available. They may make scheduled stops (semi-directo) at specific bus stations en route otherwise they make no stops en-route (sin escalas). \nOther buses such as the second class (economico, ordinario, local) buses may be very similar to first class only they travel along secondary highways through cities, towns and villages and stop anywhere along the road on request. Second class bus routes are typically shorter and will take considerably longer to travel over longer distances (such as from Cancun to Mexico City) with multiple stops and multiple transfers, it is not worth the few pesos saved over first class buses. They are fine for more local travel, such as between Cancun and Playa del Carmen or to somewhere along the highway in between. In other places they may be more frequent and more available than first class such as going to Zempoala (town) from Veracruz (city). Some of the second class buses may even be chicken buses (polleros) in rural, off the beaten track, places. \nExecutive (Ejecutivo) and Luxury (Lujo) lines cost about 60% more than first class, are faster, usually have larger seats, and they have less frequent departures; they rival flying business class on a plane and are a good option for elderly or business travelers or overnight travel in lieu of a night's stay at a hotel (or hostel).\nWhen acquiring tickets for the bus, the local custom is that the passenger comes to the terminal and buys the ticket for next available bus going to the desired destination with first and deluxe class buses unless it is during busy travel times such as Easter and Christmas. During busy travel times tickets can be booked one or two days in advance online or at the station. With second class buses, tickets can be purchased at the station within 2 hours of a departure, no advance reservations prior, at the beginning of a route or the fare paid to the driver if picked up from alongside of the road. \nWith the advent of NAFTA, some bus companies are now offering service from cities in several US states. The major bus companies offering these kind of services are:\n\n ABC (Autobuses de Baja California).

There are over 200 other companies and drivers' unions operating buses not listed in the above which you will find once there or see (or add to) the specific articles of a region, city or town.\n\n\nCity buses\nMost larger cities have a mix of public bus services and privately run bus services. For example, in Mexico City there are several bus services that are part of the public Metro transportation including large, modern articulated buses that run in dedicated lanes on major arteries, as well as electric buses and traditional buses through most neighborhood. In the city of Monterrey, there are Metrobuses that operate as part of the city's public transit network, often connecting to the Metrorrey subway/light rail stations. There are also more than a dozen private bus companies, usually providing services to a well-defined section of the city. Using the city buses can be complicated, involving various transfers and sometimes multiple providers. Information about these may be in individual destination articles here, but is more reliable in the Moovit app (available for iPhone or Android). \n\n\nColectivos / Combis / Peseros\nMany cities in Mexico have privately operated van or small bus services that run along popular routes. These go by various names including peseros, colectivos, urbans, or combis. Whatever you call them, they are sometimes vans and sometimes small buses with varying color codes depending on the city you are in and often identifying the operator or route. Usually the route taken is written on cardboard attached to the windshield or with wet and then dried soap or chalk on the windshield listing the local colonias (neighborhoods) and points of interest (Allende, WalMart, Soriana, malls, hospitals, universities, etc.) the routes are not numbered and the schedules are often informal. When a combi gets full, it leaves and won't pick up passengers along the way until somebody gets off. \nIn some cities the pesero stops at marked bus stops while in others bus stops are uncommon and you are expect to signal the bus to pick you up and drop you off wherever you want. If you don't find a stop button in a pesero; just shout the word \"baja!\" for it to stop. Fares are cheap and vary from M$5-15 (Feb 2022) approximately.\n\n\nBy carpooling\nYou can check, if there are rides offered for your route on Blablacar. Especially between bigger cities the chances are good. In order to see the prices in pesos, you need to (re)install the app and choose Mexican pesos. Prices are about 30-50% less than taking an intercity bus.\n\n\nBy train\n\nIntercity trains are slowly making a comeback in Mexico, after a 25-year hiatus. The vast majority of cities are not served but as of late 2024, a few lines have opened and there are plans for major expansions, with 7.8 billion USD set aside in the government's 2025 budget for the expansion of passenger rail.\nIt may be possible to hop aboard or on top of freight cars in some parts of the country (if you happen to be an adventurer) as many migrants traveling from Central America to the USA are doing this. The prospect of hopping the freight is dangerous due to the lack of restraints which results in falling off, getting run over by the wheels, getting hit by an oncoming train (if fallen into the wrong spot), or being robbed by bandits along the way.\n\n\nTren Maya\n\nThe most convenient for tourists is the Tren Maya, which serves the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It was constructed at breakneck speed beginning in 2018, with the first line opening in December 2023 and the full network expected to be operational in early 2024. Served by sleek, modern trains this system will open up a range of inland destinations to the millions of annual visitors who come to Cancun and the Riviera Maya. The route goes along the Caribbean coast between Cancun and Chetumal at the Belize border. It provides access to Merida and has stations at archaeological sites like Chichen Itza, Edzna, Tulum, and Palenque.\nBe aware that, as of February 2024, the Tren Maya service is not yet reliable. Trains are frequently late and often canceled. Do not rely on the Train Maya if you are on a tight schedule, such as needing to catch a flight. Train service is likely to improve over time as the dust settles from its construction.\n\n\nTren Interoce\u00e1nico\n\nAnother route that opened in 2023 is the Tren Interoce\u00e1nico, running across the Tehuantepec isthmus between Salina Cruz on the Pacific Ocean and Coatzalcocos on the Gulf of Mexico coast. Tren Interoceanico has a line that connects Coatzalcocos to Palenque where passengers can transfer to the Tren Maya.\n\n\nEl Insurgente\nAn intercity train, El Insurgente, opened in Mexico State in late 2023 and will connect to the Mexico City Metro at the Observatorio station in late 2024. This will complement the existing suburban railway network in and around Mexico City.\n\n\nTourist trains\n\nThe most famous tourist train in Mexico is the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pac\u00edfico (Chihuahua-Pacific Railway or El Chepe) between Los Mochis, Sinaloa, and the town of Creel, Chihuahua, through the gorgeous Copper Canyon. \nIn the state of Jalisco there are a couple of lines which travel from the state capital city of Guadalajara to the nearby tequila distilleries in the small town of Amatitlan on the Tequila Express and to the Jose Cuervo distilleries in the town of Tequila on the Jose Cuervo Express.\nThere is also a tourist train that runs from Tijuana to Tecate (and back again) on Saturdays.\n\n\nBy taxi\nRide-hailing is available in Mexico and the following are the most anticipated providers. There may be destinations where the service is not available due to differences with local cab groups.\n\n Uber. Works in Mexico City and other cities. (updated May 2023)\n Cabify. (updated May 2023)\n Didi. (updated May 2023)\n Bolt. Includes three cities. (updated May 2023)\nMany drivers in Mexico do not like payment by credit card. If you're having trouble hailing a ride, try switching to cash payment.\n\n\nBy thumb\nOne upside of the high petroleum prices is that hitching is beginning to be more common in Mexico again, particularly the rural areas. In areas near big cities, hitching should be more difficult, and is not really advisable for security reasons.\nHowever, in village areas, this will be really possible and most likely a nice experience. Since villagers have always had a hard time affording gas, and nowadays many are turning to picking up paying hitchhikers as a way to afford the next trip into town. Baja California, the Sierra Tarahumara and Oaxaca and Chiapas all have good possibilities for the hitchhiker.\nHitchhiking possibilities vary according to region. Mexican culture is often accepting of hitchhiking and it's a common practice among Mexican youngsters going to the beach in Easter vacations, though in some cases a money contribution is expected for gas because of its relatively high prices. You should make it clear that you have no money to offer before accepting the ride, if this is the case. If you're willing to pay, trucks will often provide lifts for about half the price of a bus ticket. Of course you may be able to negotiate a better deal. Hitchhiking is considered fairly safe and easy in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Spanish phrasebook\nSpanish is the de facto national language. Spanish is used by virtually the whole population and all public communications (signs, documents, media, etc.) are conducted in the language.\nMexico has one of the richest diversity of more than 60 indigenous languages spoken with official recognition. These languages are spoken within the communities that are largely segregated from mainstream mestizo society. About 5% of Mexicans speak an indigenous language. Most of these communities are fluent in Spanish as well.\nMany Mexicans do not speak English, even though it is understood by many in Mexico City, tour guides, and workers in popular tourist attractions. Because of this, a good knowledge of Spanish is essential for the independent traveller. \nThe most popular foreign languages to learn within Mexico after English are French, Italian, German and Japanese. German, French, and Russian may be known by some in the tourism industry, but among clerks, policemen, and drivers (most particularly the last) there is basically no such thing as knowledge of foreign languages. Bilingual signs in Spanish and English might be available in popular tourist destinations.\n\n\nSee\n\nMany travelers come to see Mexico's natural wonders, including\u02d0\n\nCopper Canyon - ride the train through an enormous canyon system in the northwestern mountains\nMesoamerican Barrier Reef - scuba dive the coral reefs in the warm waters of the Mexican Caribbean\nSea of Cortez - see migrating whales, sea lions, dolphins and more\nVolcano Belt - climb Mexico's highest mountain peaks and see active, dormant, and inactive volcanoes\nThere are 35 UNESCO world heritage sites in Mexico as of 2018, more than anywhere else in the Americas. Most of them are in the cultural category and relate to either the pre-Columbian civilizations in the area or to early colonial cities established by the Spanish conquistadores and missionaries. Much of Mexico is mountainous with some mountains rising higher than 5,000 m over the sea level.\nMexico is on the border of two bioregions; both North American wildlife and Central and South American wildlife can be seen in the country. A number of UNESCO Biosphere Reserves are in Mexico as well as a number of RAMSAR wetlands. \nThe Mexican Tourism Ministry (SECTUR) has a program called Pueblos Magicos to identify and develop tourist programs in smaller, lesser known destinations. Towns designated as Pueblos Magicos usually are rich in colonial heritage, maintain cultural traditions, or offer spectacular natural wonders. These towns are the kinds of places a couple would go for a romantic weekend because they often feature interesting historical sites in a quaint setting with local bed and breakfast inns, regional cuisine in the local restaurants, and good accessibility from major cities.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency of Mexico is the peso, denoted in Mexico as \"$\" (ISO code MXN) and in Wikivoyage as \"M$\". It is divided into 100 centavos. Prices in US dollars (in tourist areas) are labeled \"US$\" or sport an S with a double stroke.\nCoins are issued in denominations of 5, 10 (steel), 20, and 50 centavos (brass; new 50-centavo coins issued from 2011 onwards are steel and smaller in size) and 1, 2, 5 (steel ring, brass center), 10, 20, 50, and 100 pesos (brass ring, steel or silver center), but it's extremely rare to find coins valued at more than 10 pesos.\nBanknotes are produced in denominations of 20 (blue or green and pink), 50 (pink-red or purple), 100 (red), 200 (green), 500 (brown or blue), and 1,000 (purple and pink for the latest issue, purple for older issues) pesos. The current issue of 20-, 50- and 100-peso bills are made from polymer plastic, and there are several different series of all banknotes. Ten-peso notes exist, but are very rare and no longer issued and accepted.\n\n\nAcceptance of other currency\n\"Old\" pesos (issued before 1993) are no longer accepted, but are usually collected by numismatists.\nMerchants may accept US dollars at a lower exchange rate. US dollars are sometimes accepted in border towns and in some tourist areas. Even when US dollars are accepted, pesos are preferred.\nOther currencies such as the euro, pound sterling, and Swiss franc are generally not accepted by merchants, and even banks headquartered in Europe may refuse to accept euros for exchange. On the other hand, most banks and exchange offices (casas de cambio) will accept them.\nIf you arrive from the south and still carry Central American currency, try to exchange them as soon as possible, as outside of the immediate border area not even banks will accept them. As all Central American countries either have the US dollar as their national currency (El Salvador and Panama) or have it circulating to varying degrees as a de facto second currency and virtually all banks in Central America and most banks in Mexico accept US dollars (usually at better rates than any other currency) your best bet is to \"triangulate\" your money from local currency to dollars and from dollars to pesos rather than exchanging them directly, which can be difficult and expensive. Should you have forgotten to exchange your money and the banks are closed, street money changers (called coyotes or cambistas) don't have fixed opening hours and often have better rates. Be careful however, as they do from time to time rip off foreign visitors with bogus calculators, wrong rates and counterfeit or outdated (and thus worthless) bills.\n\n\nMoney exchange\nIf you have brought cash in US dollars or euros, the best places to change your money are at an arrival airport (such as Mexico City and Cancun), where many money exchanges are located already in the arrival hall (where you can also compare some exchange rates and choose the most convenient) and, normally, at airports, the exchange rate is usually fair. Be sure to pass through Customs before looking for foreign exchange as inside the customs zone in Cancun the rate is far lower than the greediest street vendors ask.\nIf you would like to wait until later to obtain Mexican currency, try not to change at your hotel, as the rates there tend to be extremely disadvantageous for tourists. However, some hotels provide exchanges as a courtesy, in this case it is best to ask just to make sure. Often, you can find money exchanges at strategic places in most tourist destinations and near the hotel (zones). The exchanges rates should not differ drastically from the ones at airport. If you are unfamiliar with Mexican money (bills, coins), try to stick to official foreign exchange booths. In several internationally popular beach destinations like Cancun and Los Cabos, local merchants are accustomed to US dollars and will often accept them as payment (they even have dual-currency cash registers and drawers). However, do bear in mind that the convenience of such \u201cprivate\u201d money exchange usually comes with a slightly unfavorable exchange rate.\n\n\nCredit cards and debit cards\nCredit cards and debit cards (with Maestro or MasterCard/Visa affiliation) are widely accepted in Mexico. You can use them at ATMs as well as in most department stores, bigger restaurants, gas stations, but be sure that outside cities you always carry sufficient cash in pesos, and generally verify the possibility to pay with card before consumption. Smaller (often family run) businesses often accept only cash. Most of the time, an extra 5% when paying with card is added. Also, you cannot get lower prices if you haggle unless you pay cash. \nWhile many Pemex stations accept credit cards, especially in locations that have heavy tourist traffic, some do not; travellers who intend to pay by credit card should always ask the attendant if the card is accepted before pumping begins.\n\n\nATMs\nBank of America customers can avoid ATM fees by using Santander Serfin ATMs. Other banks may have similar policies, check with your respective institution. For example, Banamex bank is owned by Citibank/Citigroup, and Bancomer is owned by BBVA, which is related to Chase in the United States. Ask to your bank if they have relation with Mexican banks, and the advantages that such ally can provide. Otherwise, do not be surprised to find yourself with a fee for each withdrawal. ATMs ask you if you want to accept the shown fee. In some ATMs you need to put your credit card inside crosswise.\n5 Lowest ATM fees used with UK issued Mastercard, January 2024 source: #NomadicBackpacker\n1. Inbursa - 22.04 pesos\n2.

Check with the bank (or locals) about the best time to use the ATM and never wait until the last minute to get cash.\n\n\nTipping\nTipping in Mexico is similar to the United States. It is usually from 10 to 15%.\nMeals have a 10% to 15% tip (this includes fast food deliveries). This tip is usually left by most people in restaurants, although it is not so common in street restaurants or stands, where the tenders usually have a can or box where people deposit coins.\nIt is generally common to leave a tip on the table after paying and therefore having small change is very useful.\nMexican bars and night clubs often charge directly to the bill 15% of the total amount (taxes included).  That is illegal in most cases because of the imposition of the tip and because they calculate the 15% with taxes included.  In large groups, or in nightclubs the barmen expect the customers to deposit their tip in a cup left on the table before serving the drinks so the service they give is in function with the tip they received.\nIt is also customary to give a tip to the person who sometimes guard the car as if they were valet parking; in Mexico these people are often called viene viene (literally: \"comes, comes\") or franeleros and usually people give them M$3-20 depending on the zone, although they sometimes ask for bigger sums of money when the car is left close to a night life area.\nIn medium and large retail stores such as Wal-Mart there are uniformed helpers, usually children or the elderly, who bag the products just after the clerk has scanned them. This role is called cerillo (Spanish for \"match\"). It is common for these helpers to not have a basic salary, so all the money earned is from the tips people give them. Most customers give M$2-5 depending on the number of products. Cerillos also put the bags in the cart and if the load is large they can even help bringing it to the car and unloading the bags; in these cases, they normally receive more than M$15.\nTipping is not expected in cabs or buses, except when it is a tour. In some populated Mexican restaurants wandering musicians enter, play, and expect the customers to pay something, although this is voluntary. In filling stations, the workers usually get M$2-5 for every gasoline load. In stadiums people give a small tip to the person who shows the place where they should sit. Tips are also given to bellboys, barbers and people that work in similar services.\n\n\nShopping\nIf there is no price tag, ask for the price first. The simple question is \"\u00bfCu\u00e1nto cuesta?\" and is easily understood by Mexicans.\nSome shops show the price in pesitos. That's the diminutive of peso and means the same.\n\nWeights are measured in kilograms. Length is measured in centimeters and meters.\nFor clothes and shoe sizes, the \"Continental\" measurements are used.\nMerchants can be picky about the state of your paper money and may scrutinize it and reject anything with rips. Try to keep it in as pristine condition as possible. Reputedly, this is more the case the farther south you go. In any case, you can easily enter a bank with some damaged bill to get it exchanged into another one.\nMerchants are often reluctant to make change in smaller towns. Try to avoid paying with overly large denominations; the best customer has exact change. In rural areas, your 'change' may consist of chiclets or other small commodities.\nMerchants, specially those in small markets (\"tianguis\") and street vendors are no strangers to haggling. Try asking \"\u00bfEs lo menos?\" (\"Is this the smallest price?\"), The more rural and less touristy the area you're likely to have more success.\n\nArtesanias A visit to anywhere in Mexico will give one the opportunity to buy art made in the \"old world\" manner that reflects the diverse ethnicity of Mexico. Included in these articles would be textiles, wood carvings, paintings and carved masks that are used on sacred dances and burials. In many parts of Mexico, artists welcome visitors to their workshops to see how things are made and often to buy \"direct from the source\".\nTimeshares When visiting the resort cities of Mexico (e.g. Cancun, Puerto Vallarta or similar), it is more than common to be approached on the streets, in bars, in restaurants and anywhere with offers of gifts, free rental cars, free nights, free dinners, free anything that may appeal to you, just for visiting and listening to a presentation to buy a timeshare. Unless you are severely desperate for something to do, you may want to ignore those making the offer and stay away from those free offers. While the properties are very nice, great locations and plenty of amenities, this is not the place to learn about timeshares. Do your homework before even thinking about buying a timeshare, see what the values are in the resale market and understand the rights you are buying and the future costs. Collecting on the free offers may be difficult, if not impossible.\nAutomobiles It's certainly worth going over and importing a car back from there, although importing it to the EU/US standards is the hard part. Recommended are the Ford Fusion (like the British Ford Mondeo, but more upmarket) and the Chrysler 200 (the 2.4 model is worth it). Volkswagens can be substantially better-equipped than European or North American counterparts. The Passat sold in Mexico is not the same car as in Europe, and is substantially bigger, however, engines are the same as in Europe, except for the 2.5 petrol.\nCuban cigars are a fun novelty for tourists from the US and are widely available. It's still illegal to bring them back to the US, although the worst that's likely to happen is they'll be confiscated by customs.\n\n\nDo\n\nThe warm Mexican climate, spectacular nature and long coastline make the country great for outdoor life, especially water sport.\n\nSurfing \u2013 Baja California, Vallarta, Oaxaca\nSea kayaking \u2013 Baja California\nSnorkeling \u2013 Baja California, Cancun, Cozumel, Isla Mujeres, etc.\nScuba diving \u2013 Cancun, Cozumel, Isla Mujeres, Acapulco, Cabo San Lucas etc., and cave diving in the cenotes of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nWhale watching \u2013 Baja California, Guerrero Negro, Mazunte, Zipolite\nWhite water rafting \u2013 Veracruz\nVisit a volcano \u2013 Mexico, Toluca etc.\nTake a ride on the Copper Canyon Railway\nEnjoy the beautiful coast line and beaches of Oaxaca \u2013 Huatulco, Mazunte, Zipolite, Puerto Angel, Puerto Escondido, etc.\nGo for a horseback ride in the Copper Canyon\nVisit the archaeological sites like Chichen Itza, Tulum, Coba, Monte Alban, Calakmul, Palenque, etc.\nVolunteering \u2013 Chiapas, Xalapa, Veracruz or many other destinations\nVisit ecological parks \u2013 Mayan Riviera, Chiapas, Tamaulipas\nTrekking and viewing cave paintings Baja California\n\n\nSports\nFootball (soccer) is Mexico's national sport, and its top men's league, the Liga MX, is one of the best funded outside Europe. The big four teams in the Liga MX are Am\u00e9rica, Chivas, Cruz Azul and Pumas. The rivalry between Guadalajara's Chivas and Mexico City's Am\u00e9rica, known as El S\u00faper Cl\u00e1sico, El Cl\u00e1sico de Cl\u00e1sicos or just El Cl\u00e1sico, is the biggest in Mexico, and fixtures between the two sides are guaranteed to draw partisan sell-out crowds. In Northern Mexico, the biggest game of the year is the Clasico Regio, pitting Monterrey's two top teams against each other. The Mexican national team is also a regional powerhouse, and matches against its northern neighbor, the United States, are particularly charged affairs.\nBaseball is the second biggest team sport in the country with two leagues, Liga Mexicana de Beisbol (LMB) and the Liga Pacifica (LMP)(sponsored by ARCO). The best players make it to Major League Baseball teams in the U.S., but that is not a universal goal in Mexico, where many players enjoy long careers (particularly in the Mexican League teams) and are relatively well paid. The Liga Mexicana began in 1925. It is organized as two divisions, North and South, with 18 teams playing a 114-game season, from April to September. Teams are located in many popular tourist destinations including Cancun (Tigres), Mexico City (Diablos Rojos), Guadalajara (Mariachis), Monterrey (Sultanes), and Tijuana (Toros). The LMP is a winter league with 10 teams, mostly in the states of Sinaloa and Sonora, but with teams in Mexicali (Aguilas), Guadalajara (Charros), and Monterrey (Sultanes). Monterrey and Guadalajara are the two cities with teams in both leagues, so you can catch a game there at almost any time of the year.\nAmerican Football has a long tradition in Mexico but has often been relegated to third fiddle by the more popular soccer and baseball. Estadio Azteca has seen a handful of NFL games (including, at a time, the best attended NFL game in league history up to that point) and besides a long-standing college league, there is now also a professional league with teams focused in and around Mexico City.\nBullfighting, also referred to as la fiesta brava, is a popular (but declining) spectator sport with a long Hispanic tradition stretching back as far as 2,000 years. Tradition crashes headlong into the modern world when it comes to bullfighting, where animal rights activists fight a constantly escalating war against bullfighting. Proponents of bullfighting point not only to the colorful traditions, but to the fact that the \"industry\" supporting bullfighting creates 18,000 jobs nationwide. Activists say it's a barbaric, bloodthirsty tradition that has no place in a civilized world. The debate is ongoing and while Mexico City's first bullfight was held in 1526, many people would be happy if no 500th anniversary could take place.\nMexico City's Plaza de Toros (Plaza Monumental) is the world's largest bullring and is regarded as being part of the \"triple crown\" of bullfighting, alongside Madrid and Sevilla. While animal rights activists succeeded in having bullfights blocked in Mexico City in 2022, the case was overturned on appeal and bullfights have resumed in the capital. Bullfights usually occur between November and March, but the season varies by location. In Tijuana, bullfights occur between April and October. In some smaller towns, bullfights are held only in conjunction with large festivals. In any case, travellers who might want a genuine bullfight experience should make plans to visit Mexico soon because the tradition of bullfighting may not last forever.\n\n\nEat\n\nSee also: Mexican cuisine\nMexican cuisine can be described better as a collection of various regional cuisines rather than a standard list of dishes for the whole country. Because of climate, geography and ethnic differences, we can classify Mexican cuisine broadly in 4 great categories according to the region:\n\nNorthern \u2013 Mostly meat dishes done mainly from beef and goat. This includes Cabrito, Carne Asada (Barbecue) and Arrachera. Is influenced by international cuisine (mostly from the United States and Europe), but it retains the essential Mexican flavor.\nCentral \u2013 This region is influenced by the rest of the country, but has its own well-developed local flavor in dishes such as Pozole, Menudo and Carnitas. Dishes are mostly corn-based and with different spices.\nSoutheastern \u2013 Is known for its spicy vegetable and chicken-based dishes. Caribbean cuisine have influences here because of the location.\nCoast \u2013 Has a strong emphasis on seafood and fish, but corn-based recipes can be easily found as well.\nAsk for the \"platillo tipico\" of the town, which is the local speciality that may not be found elsewhere, a variation, or the birthplace of a recipe. Also consider that most of the recipes change from place to place: for example, tamales in the south are made with the banana plant leaves, and in the Huasteca region tamales are very big (they are called \"Zacahuil\"); one is OK for a complete family.\nIf you are travelling here from Spain or elsewhere in Latin America, keep in mind that many Mexican dishes can have the same name, but be very different from their counterparts elsewhere. For instance, a Mexican tamal is very different from a Colombian tamal, and a Mexican tortilla bears virtually no similarity at all to a Spanish tortilla.\nTraditional Mexican food can often be very spicy; if you are not used to peppers, always ask if your food includes it. \"(\u00bfEsto tiene chile? Es picante?).\"\nThere are many food carts on the streets of Mexican cities and towns. Travelers are advised to eat from these carts with caution, as hygienic preparation practices are not always reliable. You can measure the quality of food by popularity; do not eat in lonely places, even if they are restaurants or hotels. Consider that Mexicans eat their main meal in the middle of the afternoon (around 3 o'clock), with breakfast or \"almuerzo\", a mid-morning affair after a very light something, like a small plate of fruit or a roll with coffee, in the very early morning. Although, many Mexicans have large breakfasts in the morning. Later, at night the meal varies from very light, such as sweet rolls or breads, coffee or hot chocolate, to heavy dinner, such as pozole, tacos, and tamales. Schedule your meals accordingly and you will get a better perspective on the gauge of how busy (popular) a restaurant is.\nIn doing so, you may (or may not) find some of the most unique and genuinely Mexican dishes you've ever had. From these vendors, you may find tacos, burgers, bread, roasted field corn or elote served with mayonnaise, or a light cream, and sprinkled with fresh white cheese, roasted sweet potato called camote, and almost any kind of food and service you would imagine.\n\nChicharr\u00f3n \u2013 Deep fried pork skin. Quite crunchy and if well-prepared slightly oily. Heavenly spread with guacamole. Or sometimes cooked in a mild chili sauce and served with eggs.\nEnchiladas \u2013 Chicken or meat stuffed soft tortillas covered with green, red or mole sauce. Some may have melted cheese inside and/or on top.\nTacos \u2013 Soft corn tortillas filled with meat (asada (steak strips), pollo (shredded chicken), carnitas (fried shredded pork), lengua (cow tongue), cabeza (meat from cow skull), sesos (cow brains), tripa (cow gut), al pastor (chili, pork, beef cut from a spit) or chorizo (pork sausage)). In the north sometimes flour tortillas are used. Do not expect the crispy taco shell anywhere.\nTamales (singular tamal) \u2013 corn dough shell with meat or vegetable fillings. Tamales Dulces contain fruit and/or nuts.\nTortas \u2013 Fancy Mexican sandwich. Bread roll that is grilled lightly, meat fillings are same as tacos: lettuce, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, beans, onion, mayonnaise and avocado. One is beginning to find tortas with the American styled cold cuts available, as well, in urban areas.\nHuitlacoche \u2013 (wit-la-ko-che) A fungus, much like mushrooms, found in corn. This dish is usually an additive to others. Foreigners might find it hard to stomach but Mexicans swear by it. Although most Mexicans love huitlacoche, most do not prepare it in their own home very frequently. It can be found in most markets or stores.\nQuesadillas \u2013 Cheese or other ingredients grilled in between corn tortillas, heavy on cheese and lighter on other items such as chicken, pork, beans, squash flower blossoms and such.\nMole \u2013 Mild to medium chili based sauce made with cocoa and a hint of peanut over meat, usually served with shredded chicken or turkey. ('Pollo en mole' and this is known as Puebla or poblano style). There are many regional moles and some are green, yellow, black and can vary greatly in flavor depending on the artistic talent or preferences involved.\nPozole \u2013 Chicken or pork broth with hominy corn, spiced when served with oregano, lettuce, lemon juice, radish, chopped onion, dried ground chile and other ingredients such as chicken, pork, or even seafood, usually served with a side dish of tostadas, fried potato and fresh cheese tacos. Very fortifying.\nGorditas \u2013 corn patty stuffed with chicharron, chicken, cheese, etc. topped with cream, cheese and hot sauce.\nGrillo \u2013 Grasshopper, usually cooked and placed inside another dish such as a quesadilla. It is frequently found in markets in the state of Morelos and other central Mexico states. This is not common in Mexico City.\nGuacamole \u2013 crushed avocado sauce with green serrano chile, chopped red tomato and onion, lime juice, salt, and served with somewhat thick (1/8 inch) fried tortilla slices or \"totopos\".\nTostadas \u2013 fried flat tortilla topped with fried beans, lettuce, cream, fresh cheese, sliced red tomato and onion, hot sauce, and chicken or other main ingredient. Think a corn chip dippers, on low dose steroids, for salsas and as above. You do not usually get a plate of this automatically in many parts of Mexico as you would in the US, although they are starting to show up in resort areas that cater to US nationals automatically.\nHuaraches \u2013 a bigger (think shoe-shaped) version of a gordita.\nSopes \u2013 corn patty topped with a wide variety of ingredients such as chicken, cheese, mashed beans, and various hot sauces.\nCarnitas \u2013 deep fried pork meat served with a variety of salsa, to get them dry with less grease.\nChile en nogada \u2013 A big green Poblano chile with a beef or pork apple stuffing, covered with a white nut (usually walnut, known as nuez) sauce and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds which happen to be red. The three colors represent the national flag and the dish is served nationwide around Mexican Independence Day (16 September).\nBarbacoa \u2013 Sheep or goat meat cooked with maguey leaves in an oven made at a hole in the ground. Think BBQ heaven without the hickory smoke or catsup-based BBQ sauce. Served with condiments and salsas in corn tortilas and sometimes in a torta bread roll.\nSopa de Tortilla \u2013 tortilla chips soup usually of chicken broth, plain or with a touch of tomato flavor, and usually mild and not at all hot. Commonly served with diced avocado and fresh crumbled white cheese on top.\nChilaquiles \u2013 tortilla chips with a green tomatillo, or red tomato, or mild chili sauce, Usually served with chicken or eggs on top or within. Usually a mild dish.\nMigas \u2013 is a typical dish in the center of the country which is a guajillo chile broth with soaked bread, which you can add the pork bones with meat or eggs.\nYou may see a sign with \"orden de tacos\". This means usually 5 pieces, if there is no other amount stated. The word orden is also used for other types of Mexican food.\nThere is breakfast in McDonald's that you may not find in other countries. It includes:\n\u2022 McMolletes\n\u2022 McMuffin Huevo y Salchicha\n\u2022 McMuffin a la Mexicana\n\u2022 Hotcakes con Salchichas\n\u2022 Desayuno Especial Mexicano\n\u2022 McBurrito a la Mexicana for M$30 (Dec 2021)\nBasic burgers you may not find in other countries during the day are for about M$30 (Dec 2021):\n\u2022 Hamburguesa Gourmet\n\u2022 Hamburguesa Especial con lechuga\n\n\nDrink\n\nTap water is potable, but generally not recommended for drinking. Hotels usually give guests one (large) bottle of drinking water per room per night. Bottled water is also readily available in supermarkets and at tourist attractions.\n\nAbsinthe is legal in Mexico.\nTequila, distilled from Agave (a specific type of cactus)\nPulque, ferment made from Maguey\nMezcal, similar to tequila but distilled from Maguey\nRaicilla, a type of mezcal made in Jalisco\nPox, whisky meets rum, distilled from grains and cane sugar, made in Chiapas\nTepache, ferment made from pineapple\nTuba, made from coconut palm tree\n\nThere are also several Mexican beers, most of which are available outside Mexico, these include Corona (popular, but not necessarily as overwhelmingly popular in Mexico as many foreigners think), Dos Equis (XX) and Modelo Especial.\nLighter Mexican beers are often served with lime and salt, though many Mexicans do not drink beer in this fashion. In some places you will find beer served as a prepared drink called \"Michelada\" or simply \"Chelada\". The formula varies depending on the place, but it's usually beer mixed with lime juice and various sauces and spices on ice served in a salt rim glass. Spicy beer is available in supermarkets; try it, it will be an experience. Other variation called \"Cubana\" includes Clamato cocktail, soybean sauce, salt and a little bit of hot sauce.\nMexico produces wine in several different areas, the most important of which is the Valle de Guadalupe in Baja California, which accounts for more than 90% of Mexico's total wine production. The second largest wine region is in the Bajio state of Queretaro centered on the town of Ezequiel Montes. Wine is also produced in the states of Sonora, Coahuila, and Guanajuato.  Most Mexicans tend to prefer European or Chilean imports, but Mexican wines are becoming more popular as they continue to earn accolades in the press and in competitions. In the prestigious 2023 Concours Mundial de Bruxelles, the top point getter was Cenzontle Blanco from Valle de Guadalupe, beating out thousands of wines from around the world.\nNon alcoholic beverages:\n\nChocolate\nAtole\nHorchata (rice based drink)\nAgua de Jamaica (hibiscus iced tea, similar to karkadai in Egypt)\nLicuados de fruta (fruit smoothies and milkshakes)\nChampurrado (thick chocolate drink)\nRefrescos (common sodas, generally sweet and made with cane sugar, not corn syrup as in the United States).\n\nThe legal drinking age in Mexico is 18, but not strictly enforced. In many places, consumption of alcohol in public (\"open container\") is illegal and usually punishable by a day in jail. Be aware of waitresses and barmen, especially at night clubs. If you are not aware of your consumption and how much you already spent, they can add a few more drinks to your account. Some do this, not all.\nAlcoholmeters are widely used in driving roads If drinking, always have a designated driver. Driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage will result in 1 to 3 days in jail.\nMexico, especially the southern state of Chiapas, produces excellent coffee. Caf\u00e9 con leche, usually one part coffee to one part steamed milk, is very popular. Unfortunately, many places in Mexico that are not caf\u00e9s serve Nescafe instant coffee, so you may have to search for the good coffee, but it's there.\nMineral water is popular in many regions of Mexico. Topo Chico is the most widely available brand by a very wide margin.\n\n\nLearn\n\nThe most important Universities in Mexico include the UNAM, ranked 73rd worldwide, and the best in Latin America. Its main campus is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Murals in the main campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history, such as Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. IPN (Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional), ITESM (Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, located in Monterrey but with branch campuses in many other Mexican cities) the Iberoamerican University (Universidad Iberoamericana, part of the Jesuit University System) and Universidad Anahuac.\n\nMost of the government-funded universities on mayor cities (state capital) have short courses on history, gastronomy and cultural subjects, most of them are almost free. Other places are the \"Casa de la Cultura\", (house of culture) that are historical buildings used for cultural related activities (music concerts, theater, paint and other exhibits, they also have \"talleres\" (workshops).\nMost places have programs for foreigners to learn Spanish, or even study a whole degree. There are some other courses where you can learn traditional Mexican activities such as handcrafts.\nThere are Spanish language schools throughout Mexico. The city with the most schools is Cuernavaca, with more than 50 schools. Oaxaca, San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato also offer a number of schools to choose from. Prices vary; however, most schools are very reasonably priced. Many schools can arrange homestays with local Mexican families.\n\n\nWork\nWorking may require a work visa, which is difficult to get if you just want to freelance for a short time.\nMany important headquarters are located throughout the main cities of Mexico. Top Mexican corporations such as Televisa, Bimbo, Cemex, Telmex and Vitra are often willing to hire professionals who are native English speakers as much of their business is developed alongside North American corporations.\nNative English speakers can pick up work as English teachers. The upside is that English speakers with no knowledge of Spanish are appreciated, because they will force their students to practice English. The downside is that salaries are somewhat low.\n\n\nSleep\n\nSeveral hotel chains are available throughout Mexico, including Palace Resorts, Le Blanc Spa Resort, Best Western, Holiday Inn, CityExpress, Fiesta Inn, Fairmont, Hilton, Ritz, Camino Real, Marriott (Sheraton, W, Westin, Four Points) and many others. Rates have risen considerably, though most are still reasonable compared to similar U.S. or European hotels. Chain accommodations are usually clean and comfortable, good for business travelers, but not necessarily for those wanting to experience Mexico itself. There are also many all-inclusive resorts for those visiting the major beach destinations.\nBoutique hotels are found all over the country; price range varies but all of them are rich in Mexican traditions, elegance and charm, the perfect way to experience the cultural heritage of each state. A great source of information is Melba Levick's book Mexicasa, found in many libraries and online bookstores. Otherwise an authentic accommodation can usually be found by asking locals or gringos, especially in the smaller towns. \nSmaller hotels and motels along the roadside may not be safe or comfortable. If you are unsure about conditions or the safety of the room, ask to see it before paying. This will not be considered rude.  Decent hotels for a low budget are usually found around the central bus station of a town. If you are going to stay at cheaper hotels in cooler areas in the winter consider bringing extra clothes, an electric blanket or a sleeping bag, as there is power, but no heat. And although it may get quite hot by afternoon outside, adobe and cement are like fridges. An electric tea kettle is also a good idea, as hot water might not be available when you want it.\nThere is a large backpacker culture in Mexico, and there are many hostels offering dorm accommodation and private rooms. You can expect to pay M$100-300 (Nov 2021) for a night in a dorm, sometimes including breakfast. Hostels are a fantastic place to share information with fellow travelers, and you can often find people who have been to your future destinations.\nIf you're travelling with children, use a plastic case (with wheels and a handle) as luggage, and it can be used as a bathtub for the kids if necessary. Budget hotels rarely, if ever, have bathtubs.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nMexico has a reputation for being a dangerous country \u2014 a reputation that's not entirely unwarranted \u2014 but the average traveller should not be too overly concerned or cautious of their surroundings. A lot of the crime occurs between those involved in the drug trade or organised crime. (See drug traffic issues for more information)\nIn most cities, location is very important as security changes from place to place. Areas close to downtown (centro) are safer to walk at night, especially on the \"Plaza\", \"Z\u00f3calo\" or \"Jard\u00edn\" (main square) and areas nearby. Stay in populated areas, avoid poor neighborhoods, especially at night, and don't walk there at any time if you are alone. Vicious beatings have been reported at resorts by people who have travelled alone, so stay alert for any suspicious-looking individual. If you wish to visit one of the slums, you should only go as part of a guided tour with a reputable guide or tour company.\nPolitical violence in Chiapas and Oaxaca has abated, and is far less of a threat than drug-related crime. However, Mexican authorities do not look approvingly on foreigners who participate in demonstrations (even peaceful ones) or voice support for groups such as the Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional and its leader, Subcomandante Marcos, even if their images and slogans are commonly sold on t-shirts and caps in markets.\nDo not wave cash or credit cards around. Use them discreetly and put them away as quickly as possible.\nThe nationwide emergency number is 911. Although Mexico has one of the largest police forces in the world, systemic corruption and low salaries often restrict the capabilities of law enforcement. Enlisting the help of the police almost always requires solid Spanish-language skills.  \nBeggars are not usually a threat, but you will find lots in urban areas. Avoid being surrounded by them, as some can pickpocket your goods. Giving away two pesos quickly can get you out of such troubles (but may also attract other beggars). Most poor and homeless Mexicans prefer to sell trinkets, gum, sing, or provide some meager service than beg outright.\nLarger cities, such as Guadalajara and Mexico City, are safer than most places in Mexico. However, caution is still recommended.\n\n\nDrug crimes\n\nFormer president Felipe Calderon waged war on the drug cartels, and in turn, they waged war against the government (and more often, among each other).\nSome Mexican northern and border cities such as Tijuana, Nogales, Nuevo Laredo, Chihuahua, Culiac\u00e1n, Durango, and Ju\u00e1rez can be dangerous if you are not familiar with them, especially at night. Most crime in the northern cities is related to the drug trade and police corruption. However, since law enforcement figures are often overwhelmed battling drug-related activities, many northern border towns that were somewhat dangerous to begin with are now a hotbed for criminals to act with impunity. Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, in particular, bears the brunt of this violence, and with nearly a fourth of Mexico's overall murders, travel there requires special attention.\nAway from the northern states, cartel related violence is centered in specific areas, including the Pacific Coast states of Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero. However, exercise caution anywhere, especially at night or in high crime areas.\nTourists and other travellers are of no interest to the drug cartels. Many popular tourist destinations like Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Los Cabos, Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Canc\u00fan, M\u00e9rida, and Guadalajara are largely unaffected by this, simply because there are no borders there. Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez is a primary battleground in the drug war, and while foreign travellers are not often targeted, the presence of two warring cartels, many small opportunistic gangs, and armed police and soldiers has created a chaotic situation to say the least.\nAs a rule of thumb, the further away you are from the border, and the closer you are to Mexico City, the safer you'll be. Many people go to Mexico City to seek refuge from drug-related violence as many politicians and military personnel are there. \nConsumption of drugs is not recommended while you are in Mexico because consumption in public areas will get you a fine and will most likely get you in trouble with the police. The army also sets up random checkpoints throughout all major highways in search of narcotics and weapons. Drug consumption is also frowned upon by a large percentage of the population.\n\n\nAdvice for the beach\nJellyfish stings: vinegar or mustard on the skin, take some to the beach with you.\nStingray stings: water as hot as you can bear \u2013 the heat deactivates the poison.\nSunburns: Bring only reef-safe sunscreen if going to beaches because you might not find it available in some areas.\nRiptides: Very dangerous, particularly during and after storms.\n\n\nPublic transportation\nWhen in major cities \u2013 especially Mexico City \u2013 it is better to play it safe with taxis.  The best options are to phone a taxi company, to request that your hotel or restaurant call a taxi for you, or to pick up a taxi from an established post (Taxi de Sitio). Also, taxis can be stopped in the middle of the street, which is okay for most of the country, but particularly unsafe in Mexico City.\nAs chaotic as it might be sometimes, the Metro is the best way to move around in Mexico City: it's cheap (M$5 for a ticket as of Feb 02, 2020), safe, has a large network covering almost anywhere you'd want to go in the city and it's extremely fast, compared to any on-street transportation, since it doesn't have to bear with the constant traffic jams. If you've never been in a crowded subway, avoid peak hours (usually from 06:00\u201309:00 and 17:00\u201320:00) and do your homework: check first which line (l\u00ednea) and station (estaci\u00f3n) you want to go to and the address of the place you're trying to reach. Your hotel can give you this information, and maps of the subway system are available on the internet and at the stations. Most stations also have maps of the vicinity.\nAvoid taking the subway at late hours of the night, but during the day many stations are patrolled by police officers and the subway is safer than taking the public bus. Your major concern in the subway is the pickpockets, so keep your important belongings and wallets in a safe place.\nA word of caution for people who are used to European or major American subway systems that operate around the clock: even in Mexico City, the last subway leaves around midnight, with service only resuming in the early morning. Taxis are priced accordingly, and you should keep your wits about you when moving around in the middle of the night.\nIf you are travelling by bus, do not put your valuables in your big bag in the storage compartment of the bus. If the police or the military controls the luggage, they might take out what they want, especially in night buses, when passengers are most likely asleep. The use of a money belt (worn underneath the clothes and out of sight) is highly recommended.\n\n\nDriving\nAll distances on the signboards and speed limits are in metric units.\nGas is likewise sold in metric units and far cheaper than in Europe (and still a bit cheaper than in the U.S.)\n\nIf driving in from the USA, always purchase Mexican liability insurance (legal defense coverage recommended) before crossing the border or immediately after crossing. When you are paying for your temporary import permit (for going beyond border areas), often in the same building there are several stalls selling Mexican auto insurance. Even if your American (or Canadian, etc.) insurance covers your vehicle in Mexico, it cannot (by Mexican law) cover liability (e.g., hitting something or injuring someone). You will probably spend time in a Mexican jail if you have an accident without it. And even if your own insurance does (in theory) provide liability coverage in Mexico\u2014you'll be filing your claim from behind bars! Don't risk it, get Mexican auto insurance.\nNever drive above the speed limit or run stop signs/red lights, as Mexican police will use any excuse to pull over tourists and give you a ticket. In some cities, the police can not give you a ticket, but they might warn you. The fine for speeding could be as much as US$100 (M$1870), depending on the city.\nAs of April 2011, police across the country are cracking down on drunk driving, particularly in Mexico City, the larger cities, and the beach resorts. There are random checkpoints throughout the country in which every driver has to stop and take an automated inebriation test. If you fail, you will end up in a Mexican prison. \nYou will mostly find beggars and windshield cleaners at some traffic lights; having your windows closed at all times is especially recommendable in some areas of Mexico City. The windshield cleaners will try to clean yours: a strong and firm \"no\" is suggested.\n\n\nNatural disasters\nNatural disasters in Mexico include hurricanes and earthquakes. Mexico City in particular is located in a seismically active area. \n\n\nFirearms\nEvery year a few U.S. tourists run afoul of Mexico's strict gun laws. Bringing guns into Mexico is illegal in most circumstances, and this includes guns kept for personal protection on private boats. If you want to bring a firearm, see Recreational shooting#Mexico.\n\n\nHiking\nMany trails are unmarked in real life, even if they are present at OpenStreetMap or a hiking app. If a local rule says to do a trail with a guide - it's much better to go with the guide, the route will be dangerous and easy to get lost.\n\n\nStay healthy\nSome parts of Mexico are known for travelers' diarrhea, often called \"Montezuma's Revenge\" (Venganza de Moctezuma). The reason for this is not so much the spicy food but the contamination of the water supply in some of the poorer zones in Mexico. In most of the small towns that are less industrialized, only the poorest Mexicans will drink tap water. The best policy is to only drink bottled or purified water, both of which are readily available. Be sure to specify bottled water in restaurants and avoid ice (which is often not made from purified water). Just like in the US, in most major Mexican cities the water is purified at the cities' water company. In most restaurants in these poor zones, the only water served comes from large jugs of purified water. If you get sick, visit your local clinic as soon as possible. There is medicine available that will counter the bacteria.\nMedicine in urban areas is highly developed, public hospitals are just as good as public hospitals in US, and just as the American public hospitals, they are always full. It's recommended going to private hospitals for faster service.\nBefore traveling to rural areas of Mexico, it might be a good idea to obtain anti-malarial medications from your health care provider.\nIt is strongly advised that the traveler be sure that any meats they are consuming have been thoroughly cooked due to an increasing rate of roundworm infections, particularly in the Acapulco area.\nAlong with the risk for malaria, mosquitoes have also been known to carry the West Nile virus. Be sure to bring an effective insect repellent, preferably one that contains the ingredient DEET.\nThe rate of AIDS/HIV infection in Mexico is lower than in the US, France and most Latin American nations. However, if you plan on having sex, be sure that you use a latex condom to reduce your risk of contracting or spreading the virus.\nAs with any western location, cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported throughout Mexico. This is an acute, rare (but often fatal) illness for which there is no known cure. The virus is believed to be present in animal feces, particularly feces from members of the rodent family. Therefore, do not wander into animal dens and be especially careful when entering enclosed spaces that are not well ventilated and lack sunlight.\nVaccination against Hepatitis A & B and Typhoid fever is recommended.\nIf you are bitten by an animal, assume that the animal was carrying rabies and seek medical attention immediately for treatment.\nIn remote areas, carry a first aid kit, aspirin, and other related items that are sold without medical prescription.\n\n\nRespect\n\nMexicans have a somewhat relaxed sense of time so it's vital to be patient. Arriving half an hour late is common and should not be taken in a negative light. \nWhen anyone, even a total stranger, sneezes, you always say \"\u00a1salud!\" (\"bless you!\" or more literally, \"your health!\"): otherwise, it is considered rude. In rural areas, particularly in the Mexican heartland (Jalisco, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, etc.), the even more pious \"Jes\u00fas te bendiga\" (May Jesus bless you) will follow a sneeze.\nAttitudes towards LGBT travellers can be hostile in more rural states, but Mexico City is very LGBT friendly as are popular beach resort areas such as Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, and Acapulco. By court order, all states in Mexico either allow the performance of same-sex marriages, or recognize such marriages when performed in other states. Same-sex marriage is performed in Mexico City and in the states of Aguascalientes, Baja California, Baja California Sur, Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Colima, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n, Morelos, Nayarit, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Oaxaca, Puebla, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Sinaloa, Sonora and Tlaxcala as well as in certain municipalities in Guerrero and Zacatecas. It is pending publication in Quer\u00e9taro, and being prepared for legislation in Yucat\u00e1n. Southern Mexico City is the best place in terms of tolerance.\nWhen entering churches, always take off any sunglasses, caps or hats. Wearing shorts is rarely a problem, but still wear a sweatshirt or sweater to your waist to avoid showing too much skin, which could be disrespectful in such places. However, away from the beaches, or northern areas, shorts are very rarely worn by Mexicans on the street and thus will attract more attention to you and make you stand out as a foreigner.\n\n\nSensitive issues\nShow respect to Mexico's laws. Although corruption and bribery have long been around, a visitor behaving in a way that implies that Mexico is a lawless country is considered disrespectful. Offering a bribe to an official may get you into trouble. \nYou are unlikely to cause offence by having a discussion about local politics, economics and history; Mexicans consider them good conversational topics and are more than happy to delight you with such discussions. This said, sensitive subjects like illegal immigration to the US, crime, or the drug war are likely to arouse strong emotions. Mexicans are well aware of their country's problems and would like to forget about them once in a while. \nAlso, you might be surprised at how much Mexicans know about the politics of your country \u2013 especially the times in its history when they feel your country has screwed Mexico over (which applies especially for Spain, France and the U.S.). That said, Mexican history tends to be viewed as a series of shades of grey \u2014 there are those who feel the need to extol economic growth under Porfirio D\u00edaz, just like there are those who point out anti-democratic tendencies under Benito Juarez.\nA lot of Mexicans do not have a favourable opinion of the Spanish Empire and the things they've done in the past. They feel that many of Mexico's problems are rooted in what the Spanish brought over. This said, there are no feelings of resentment towards Spain and Spanish people. \nTry not to assume the worst in people. Mexico may have a lot of social and political problems, but that does not mean that everyone is alike. \nThe great majority of the population is and traditionally has been Roman Catholic, and there is still a strong following of this faith among Mexicans from all socioeconomic backgrounds. However, there are sizeable Protestant, Evangelicial, Pentecostal communities (in part due to US missionary activity) and the country also has one of the largest Jehovah's Witnesses communities. The irreligious are a small minority and they are found mostly among college-educated urban dwellers of the middle and upper middle class. Saying anything that hints at atheism or agnosticism may simply be shrugged off, or could incite lengthy discussions or at worst, attempts at proselytizing. As a rule of thumb, try not to have religious discussions with people you're not well acquainted with.\n\n\nCultural notes\nWhile overt racism may not be apparent, as a general rule, wealth and social status are historically tied to European ancestry and skin color. Mexican society is sharply divided by social class, with the rich, middle class, and poor often living very separate lives, and can have very distinct cultures. Social practices or tastes of one social group may not be shared by all classes. Clubs, bars, and restaurants may cater largely to one crowd or another, and a wealthier person or tourist may feel out of place or received unwanted attention in a working class cantina; a poor looking person may be blatantly refused service or get unfriendly stares at an exclusive establishment.\nThere are many words in the country according to ethnic background:\n\nDo not be offended to be called a \"g\u00fcero(a)\" (blonde) and its diminutive form \"g\u00fcerito(a)\" (blondie), as its a common way for the average Mexican citizen to refer mostly to Caucasian people, including white Mexicans. The words \"gringo\" and its synonym \"gabacho\" are used regardless of the actual nationality of the tourists and they are not meant as offensive. Actually, they are often used as terms of endearment.\nIf you are East Asian, you will be referred to as \"Chino(a)\" (Chinese) and its diminutive form \"chinito(a)\" regardless of whether you are Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, etc. Exceptions are in the capital, Mexicali, and in Monterrey, where a decent-sized Korean community does exist.\nIf you are black, \"negro(a)\" or \"negrito(a)\" may seem harsh, especially if you are from the US, but it is not a swear word. Although there are few black people in Mexico in many regions of the country (except in on the east and west coasts in the south), Mexicans, especially the younger generations, are not hateful. In fact, a revolutionary who later became the second president was a man of mixed European and African descent, Vicente Guerrero.\nHistorically, all Middle Easterners were referred to as \"turcos\" (even if they were from Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, etc.)\n\n\nOther things to watch out for\nIf you try to use Spanish to address people, be careful about the use of \"t\u00fa\" (informal, friendly; the verb for calling someone \"t\u00fa\" is tutear) and \"usted\" (formal, respectful) forms. Using \"t\u00fa\" can be demeaning to people, since this is the form normally used for addressing children or close friends. Use \"usted\" unless you are sure you can use \"t\u00fa\"; doing so may perhaps seem a shade old-fashioned, but doing otherwise can be pretty rude and embarrassing in some situations. Always use the \"usted\" form to a law enforcement officer (or other person of authority), even if they may use the \"t\u00fa\" form to talk to you. Otherwise, you can say \"t\u00fa\" to children under 16, to people who genuinely are your friends and to persons who call you by your first name or explicitly have told you to do so.\nPeople address each other depending on their social status, age and friendship. To refer to a woman, always call her \"se\u00f1orita\" (Miss) unless you are sure that she is married, then you call her \"se\u00f1ora\" (Mrs). When talking to an older man, use \"se\u00f1or\" irrespective of his marital status. If you want to call a waiter, address him as \"joven\" which means \"young man\". You may call someone by his professional title (\"ingeniero\", \"arquitecto\", \"doctor\", \"oficial\", etc.). Actually, Mexican people will use the \"t\u00fa\" and \"usted\", \"first name\" or \"surname\" depending on their relationship, and the code is not easy to learn.\nWhile the word \"g\u00fcey\" is equivalent to \"dude\" or \"mate\" among young people, it is still considered extremely vulgar by the older generation. This abrasive term of endearment is used only between people who have achieved a certain level of trust, so avoid using it.\nIn Mexico, \"est\u00fapido\" has a far, far worse connotation than \"stupid\" in English.\nDue to the highly matriarchal nature of Mexican culture, the combination of words \"tu madre\" (your mother) is cacophonous and taken offensively by residents, regardless of age or gender. To refer to somebody's mother, remember to replace it with \"su se\u00f1ora madre\" (roughly \"your respected mother\") in formal situations or the sweeter \"tu mam\u00e1\" in informal ones. Never, ever use strong language when talking to a woman.\nYou may see displays of male chauvinism. It is falling out of favor, but it is still seen and mostly tolerated in small towns, as well as cities that receive considerable amounts of rural migrants. It can be defined as a male's strong desire for and skill of the domination and imposition of will, on a wife, sister, or any close female. It can also be identified by a strong desire to prove courage through showy bravado and status through a following of yes-men and henchmen. While it is usually not directed towards visitors, it can be in a variety of strengths. It is best to pretend not to notice it and move on.\nAnother type of machismo, which perhaps stems out of the same desires but does not carry any of the antisocial connotations, is male courteousness towards women. This is manifested in standing up when a lady enters a room, opening or holding a door, conceding preference or rights of way, giving up a seat, offering a hand when stepping down from a steep step, etc. It is generally reserved for older women, or women of great power, merit, and social stature. Rejecting these types of friendly gestures is considered arrogant or rude.\n\n\nConnect\nCell phones are the most convenient, and usually most inexpensive, way to talk. Before going to Mexico, call your cell phone provider and verify that you have international roaming enabled (and make sure you know what charges you should expect, for domestic and international voice calls and for data, since you will want to use your maps and Uber apps). \nYou can make international calls free if you have an app like WhatsApp or Telegram and connect to Wi-fi before using it. Data rates can be high for cell phone users, but you can manage them by turning off data in your phone's settings except for when you actively want to use an app.\nIf you're going to be in Mexico for an extended period of time, it might be cheaper to use Mexican carriers, either by buying a SIM card or a cheap throwaway phone.  If you have an unlocked GSM phone, you can buy a prepaid SIM card in Mexico. The most expensive provider Telcel provides good coverage throughout the country. A SIM card for the Telcel brand amigo express is for M$29 (Nov 2021) e.g., in an Oxxo store. The first recharge must be at least M$50 (Nov 2021). The offers are amongst others:\n\u2022 M$50: 400MB for 7 days (Nov 2021)\n\u2022 M$100: 1,3GB for 15 days  (Nov 2021)\nYou can see all rates and recharge here. Recharging Telcel can be also done in an Oxxo.\nCheaper providers unfortunately may not be worth the hassle due to slow internet and unreliable connection.\nUsing a Mexican SIM card is often far cheaper than what hotels will charge you for outgoing calls and incoming calls may be free under certain schemes. Mexico operates on the same GSM frequency as the United States, 1900 MHz. There's also 4G LTE, with 5G expected to be deployed in the future. Many of which are the same frequencies as in the US. There is a wireless internet connection in almost every restaurant in the big cities.\nIf you're staying for over a week and don't have an unlocked phone, it might be a good idea to buy a cheap handset and a prepaid card.\nSome areas have only a few internet cafes; in others, they are plentiful. Most of the internet cafes offer calls to the US for a better rate than a payphone, usually via VoIP.\nYou can call from public phones using tarjetas ladatel (prepaid telephone cards), bought at magazine stalls. Cards can be purchased in M$30, 50 or 100 denominations. The rate to call the US is roughly equivalent to US$0.50 per minute. Beware these are different than tarjetas amigo, viva, or unefon (these are only for cellphones). Ladatel cards are becoming increasingly difficult to find and use because public pay phones are an endangered species. While they worked great in 2002, they're seldom useful in 2022. Cell phones are the way to go today.\n\n\nGo next\n\n\nTo Belize\nThere are bus services available from Chetumal to Belmopan.\n\n\nTo Guatemala\nThis route is not used by many and still has a touch of adventure: Over Tenosique, La Palma (near Tenosique), by boat on the river Rio San Pedro to El Naranjo in Guatemala. Stay firm when negotiating over the price. Absolutely important: Make sure you get your passport stamped before you leave El Naranjo, or you might catch one of the rare buses back and take a walk through the jungle, as the emigration office is partway up the river between the Mexican border and the village.\n\n\nTo the United States\nThe U.S. generally requires a passport for entry. A few express ID cards and trusted traveler cards are also acceptable. U.S. and Canadian citizens seeking entry or reentry by land or sea may use an Enhanced Driver License in place of a passport. U.S. permanent residents need their permanent resident card and may need the passport from their home country.\nForeign nationals entering the United States without a permanent resident stamp, including those on the Visa Waiver Program, typically receive an I-94 Arrival-Departure Record or I-94W Visa Waiver Arrival-Departure Record upon arrival in the United States. So long as the I-94 has not expired, you can use it to re-enter the United States with your passport; however, if you hand it in upon exit, you will need to obtain a new card if your visa allows another entry or, if on the Visa Waiver Program, pay a fee of about US$6 to reenter the United States.\nUnless you are not going to return to the United States, keep your I-94 when leaving the United States or you will have a difficult time getting back in, and if your visa is limited to a certain number of entries, you may need to use another entry.\nVisa Waiver participants cannot reset the 90-day counter unless they leave North America, so ducking into Mexico will not allow you another 90 days. However, it can be reset by travelling, for example, to any Central American country or to Colombia.",
