  "extract": "Asunci\u00f3n is the capital and largest city of Paraguay. Unlike other capitals of South America such as Buenos Aires, Quito or Lima, Asunci\u00f3n is off the beaten path as it lacks well known tourist attractions. However, the number of visitors is on the rise and those who visit the Paraguayan capital will discover an authentic Latin American city which has managed to keep a quiet atmosphere and preserves interesting sights and monuments of its rich history and colonial past. Asunci\u00f3n is nonetheless a thriving city with an important commercial activity, a rich cultural scene with interesting museums, theaters and art galleries, an active nightlife and some excellent hotels and restaurants.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe Asunci\u00f3n metropolitan area is home to 2.2 million of Paraguay's 6.9 million inhabitants. It is a cosmopolitan and demographically young city with 65% of its residents under the age of 30.\nMany landmarks and historical buildings in the old city centre have recovered their past splendour thanks to Paraguay's bicentennial independence celebrations that took place during 2011 and demanded a lot of restoration works throughout the city. In 2012, a new riverside promenade (costanera) was opened along the Bay of Asunci\u00f3n which added a much needed space for running, walking and family recreation. Around the city tree-lined avenues, small parks and shady squares break up the rigid grid system of streets in the downtown area. From July to September the whole city is drenched in colour with the prolific pink and yellow bloom of lapacho trees, which grow everywhere.\n\n\nHistory\nAsunci\u00f3n was founded in 1537 by Juan de Salazar y Espinosa, a Spaniard and member of the Pedro de Mendoza expedition which was set to colonize the Rio de la Plata basin, on 15th August the day of the feast of the Assumption of Mary, that is why is so named. It is the longest continually inhabited settlement in the R\u00edo de la Plata basin and in early colonial times it was referred to as Madre de Ciudades (mother of cities) because it was from here that numerous expeditions and missionaries set off to colonize the region founding many other settlements like Corrientes, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Asunci\u00f3n was established on the eastern bank of a calm bay in the river Paraguay, rendering it a good lookout post. In 1541 the first Cabildo (town council) was created transforming Asunci\u00f3n from a military fort to a civilian town with a local government.\nThe first president after independence, Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia, who ruled Paraguay from 1814 to 1840, began to put some town planning. Under his successor, Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez, the railway was inaugurated, and some of the handsome 19th century buildings went up. The following president, Mariscal Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez, in the short period before he embarked on his catastrophic War of the Triple Alliance, built the grandest of the city's buildings, his own residence, known today as the Palacio de L\u00f3pez. The city centre is an old testament to 19th century historic ideals, with names reflecting local heroes and battles. During the Chaco War against Bolivia of 1932-35 many buildings in the city were improvised as hospitals and military barracks.\nSince the 1970-80s internal migration from the countryside to Asunci\u00f3n has made the city to increase in size and population until becoming one continuous urban spread comprising more than a dozen different cities that form the Greater Asunci\u00f3n metro area. The most interesting for tourists to visit are Luque, San Lorenzo, Capiat\u00e1, Itaugu\u00e1 and Villa Hayes among others.\n\n\nPresent day\nToday Asunci\u00f3n is a bustling, chaotic city with some 600,000 inhabitants within its city limits, and around 2.5 million people in its metro area. However, behind the new tall glassy buildings, corporate headquarters and shopping malls, Asunci\u00f3n retains a laid back atmosphere. When visiting the city a mix of three different architectural styles will be present: colonial style (present in the oldest houses and buildings of the city centre); italianate public buildings and manors (with beautiful gardens) and modern Latin American architecture (including a large shopping malls next to residential houses).\nTourism has become important for Asunci\u00f3n and it is specially visible in the Business District and Villa Morra neighbourhoods where economic growth has resulted in a plethora of new hotels and shops, as well as innovative new bars and restaurants. The majority of visitors are businessmen of neighboring Latin American countries and day trippers from Argentina. They come to enjoy low prices on practically all goods and services from restaurant meals to electronics and even car tyres.\n\n\nVisitor information\n1 Senatur (National Tourism Board), Palma 468, \u260f +595 21 441530, toll-free: 0800 113030, fax: +595 21 491230. The main national tourist information office also called Turista roga (visitors house). It has a visitors information centre and an exhibition hall for sale of traditional arts, crafts and books. Additional information booth at Silvio Pettirossi International Airport. \n2 Centro de Informaci\u00f3n Tur\u00edstica (Tourist Information Centre), Avenida Costanera. Municipal tourist office on the riverside promenade. \n\n\nClimate\n\nAsunci\u00f3n is just south of the Tropic of Capricorn so the climate is subtropical. That means hot weather, especially in the South American summer (winter in the Northern Hemisphere). Between November and March, the temperature can consistently climb over 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) and the humidity can be high and uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the weather changes frequently from one week to another. When the sun shines you bake and it can be very dry when the rains hold off for just a few days. Rains can be heavy and make the temperature drop precipitously. Then the clouds build and it becomes cold.\n\n\nTalk\nThe city, as the whole country, is officially bilingual, with 79% of people speaking Spanish as their first language, and 20% have Guaran\u00ed as their first tongue. English is not widely spoken outside of hotels and tour operators so without some basic Spanish phrases it might be hard to get by. Public transportation, street signs and all road signalization are in Spanish. Business people and the younger generations have some knowledge of English. Although locals will appreciate an effort to say a few words in Spanish, they will try to communicate in English if they can. The majority of restaurants have Spanish-only menus and waiters seldom speak other languages than Spanish or Guaran\u00ed.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n\n1 Silvio Pettirossi International Airport (ASU  IATA) (17 km (11 mi) northeast of Asunci\u00f3n.).   \n\n\nInternational flights\nInternational flights are available to:\n\nEurope \u2013 Madrid with Air Europa\nArgentina \u2013 Buenos Aires with Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, LATAM and Paranair, and C\u00f3rdoba with Air Europa\nBrazil \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos with LATAM, Gol and Paranair\nUruguay \u2013 Montevideo with Paranair\nChile \u2013 Santiago with LATAM\nBolivia \u2013 Santa Cruz de la Sierra with Amaszonas\nPer\u00fa \u2013 Lima with LATAM\nColombia \u2013 Bogota with Avianca\nPanam\u00e1 \u2013 Panam\u00e1 City with Copa Airlines\nUnited States \u2013 Miami with Eastern Airlines (not around since 1991)\n\n\nDomestic flights\nDomestic flights are available to:\n\nCiudad del Este with Paranair and Sol del Paraguay\nEncarnaci\u00f3n and Pedro Juan Caballero with Sol del Paraguay\nConcepci\u00f3n, Vallem\u00ed, Fuerte Olimpo and Bahia Negra with Setam.\n\n\nGround transportation\nGround transportation from the airport to the city centre takes 30\u201345 minutes by taxi, and they charge a fixed rate of about USD$25. \nThere is a bus stop 200 m outside the airport terminal where you can catch city bus 30-A that will take you into the city in 1 hour and the fare is GS.3,300. There are no signs to point the way to the stop, but just walk out of the terminal and turn right. Local buses are not suited for carrying big pieces of luggage, and they don't run during the night from 23:00 to 05:00 when many flights arrive and depart. \nCar rental is available at the airport and many companies have offices on the arrivals floor. Also, some major hotels have their own private minibuses.\n\n\nBy bus\n\n2 Terminal de Omnibus de Asunci\u00f3n (bus terminal) (about 5 km (3 mi) southeast of the city centre). Take a taxi or bus (city buses N\u00b08, N\u00b038, among many others) to go downtown. The terminal is at the junction of two main city avenues. The Avenida Fernando de la Mora in front of the bus terminal leads west to the city centre. The Avenida Rep\u00fablica Argentina at the side of the terminal goes north to Villa Morra, Carmelitas, the Business District and the airport. (updated Dec 2023)\nTicket offices for all bus companies are inside the terminal on the first floor. It's also possible to buy tickets for some national long-distance destinations and international destinations at travel agencies and online at the corresponding bus company website.\nThere are normally two types of bus services to the largest cities in Paraguay: com\u00fan and directo. While the first are cheaper, they also stop in every town or bus stop along the way to pick up and drop off passengers and take longer time than the directo which runs direct or with fewer or no stops to reach their destination in less time. Directo buses are less frequent having only a couple of services a day generally at midnight or early in the morning or late afternoon.\n\nEncarnaci\u00f3n, com\u00fan: 7\u20138 hr, several daily, GS.50,000; also directo: 5 hr, GS.75,000\nCiudad del Este, several daily, 5\u20137 hr, GS.40,000\u201370,000\nConcepci\u00f3n, about 5-6 hr, several daily, GS.90,000 (possible to negotiate to GS.80,000 depending on your arguments)\nCities in the Chaco: Loma Plata, Filadelfia, Neuland, Mariscal Estigarribia, about 8 hr, 1 or 2 daily to each destination, GS.90,000 (NASA, Golondrina).\nIf time is an issue and money not, it is wise to spend extra to get the better service (e.g. the GS.70,000 bus to Ciudad del Este takes 2-3 hr less than the GS.40,000 services). Food and drink is often served on the more expensive long-distance services, and almost all will stop en route to let someone on selling chipa and cocido.\n\n\nInternational buses\nThere are several connections between Asunci\u00f3n and Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile and Peru.\n\nBuenos Aires, ~17 hr, several daily, GS.300,000 (Crucero del Norte, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n/Chevallier)\nSanta Cruz, ~24 hr, US$45-65.\nFrom Formosa (Argentina):\nDirect bus: 12:30; AR$350; 2 hr.\nExchanging bus at the border (cheaper and faster):\nTake a bus from Formosa to the border (San Ignacio de Loyola International Bridge): 07:30, 10:00, 12:20, 15:45, 19:15, 22:10 - AR$150 - 1.5 hr.\nCross the border. Do not change money with the vendors standing around right at the border control, their rate is about 10% off the actual/interbank exchange rate. There is an 1 official money exchange a few 100 m further. Get back to the border control building. The bus to Asunci\u00f3n leaves directly 3 next to this building.\nTake the bus from the border building to the Asunci\u00f3n Bus Terminal (get off early depending on you accommodation): Every hour or so - GS.6,000 - 30-45 min.\n(Note that some buses from Formosa just go to the 4 Clorinda Bus Terminal (Argentina) without a stop at the Loyola International Bridge, and others go to Loyola, including Clorinda. But there is also a pedestrian crossing across the river into Nanawa (Paraguay) directly from the center of Clorinda near the bus terminal. Formalities should be similar as just explained. The bus stop on the Paraguayan side is 100 m left after the crossing.)\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra (Bolivia) \u2013 One bus daily departing from Asunci\u00f3n at night - meaning that you miss out on any views of the Chaco. The bus is extremely slow and occasional roadblocks on the Bolivian side of the border can cause your journey time to double. The trip takes 21-24 hr and costs US$40-60. Consider that a flight might only be marginally more expensive, depending on the time of booking. Any intermediate exit or boarding (like Mariscal Estigarribia or Villamontes) will likely cost the same as the complete trip. But if your nerves are strong, you will get the price down bargaining directly with the bus driver.\n\n\nBy car\nAsunci\u00f3n is very well connected to all the major cities of Paraguay; moreover, as the capital, it is the beginning and terminus of the country's main highways. Route 1 goes southeast for 362 km (225 mi) to Encarnaci\u00f3n. Route 2 (which then becomes Route 7 at Coronel Oviedo) goes east for 325 km (202 mi) to Ciudad del Este. Route 3 goes northeast for 460 km (286 mi) to Pedro Juan Caballero. Route 9, better known as the Transchaco Highway, goes northwest for 740 km (460 mi) to the Paraguay/Bolivia border. After 15 km (9 mi) on this route just after leaving Asunci\u00f3n and crossing the bridge over the river Paraguay, a side road goes southwest for 20 km (12 mi) to Puerto Falc\u00f3n at the Paraguay/Argentina border.\n\n\nBy boat\nCopanatra car ferries link Asunci\u00f3n to Argentina crossing the river Paraguay between the 5 Port of Ita Enramada at the end of Avenida Per\u00f3n on the southern edge of the city with Puerto Pilcomayo, on the Argentinian side, every 30 min M-F 06:30-17:30, and Sa and holidays 07:00-13:30.\n\n\nBy train\nThere is no longer any train service to Asunci\u00f3n. The beautiful 19th-century train station building next to Plaza Uruguaya is now a museum and cultural events venue.\n\n\nGet around\nThe historic centre of Asunci\u00f3n is small enough to be explored by foot. However, some of the attractions, such as the Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico (Botanical Garden) are a bit outside. In addition to the city's historical core - which is essentially between the streets Col\u00f3n and Antequera - the Carmelitas area has become a hub for retail and entertainment, containing several large shopping centres and North American-style bars and restaurants. East-west street names change at Independencia Nacional, and North-South ones at Avenida Mariscal L\u00f3pez.\n\n\nBy bus\n\nBuses are ubiquitous, cheap and an experience in themselves (be careful while exiting, since many only slow down rather than stop for passengers to get off). They go more or less everywhere in the city: destinations are displayed on boards on the front window, if in doubt just shout your intended destination at the driver when he stops and he'll tell you yes or no. There are sometimes a few different versions of each bus number: 16, 16.1, 16.2 etc. which often have different routes from each other, so watch out not to accidentally get on the wrong one. There aren't many official bus stops in Asunci\u00f3n, you can just stick your arm out and flag down a bus pretty much anywhere. No bus schedules or maps are available, but the locals know which buses go where, so just ask. (You'll need some knowledge of Spanish to do that.) The fare is GS.3,600 if the bus is air-conditioned (con aire), GS.2,200 if it isn't (as of 2018). Fares are paid with a JAHA card which can be bought at supermarkets, kioskos and drugstores.\nSome useful bus routes:\n\nCentre (Oliva) to Shopping del Sol: 28, 30\nCentre to Shopping Mariscal Lopez/Villa Morra: 18, 26, 28, 30.2 (from Oliva), 56 (from Haedo)\nCentre (Oliva) to the Botanical Gardens: 1, 13\nCentre (Oliva) to the Bus Terminal: 8, 36\nCentre (Haedo) to Mercado 4: 2, 21, 25, 27, 29, 133\nCentre (Oliva) to the airport: 30A\nOn OpenStreetMap (which is used by mobile apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz), many bus stops are marked with the number of the buses passing by. This can give you a pretty good feeling about bus routes by searching for a bus number. Or just look up a destination and which bus numbers go there, then search for your nearest bus stop with any of the identified numbers.\n\n\nBy taxi\n\nTaxis are also available and reasonably inexpensive. Many of the taxis are old, lumbering diesel Mercedes, which can be a fun throwback. A 30% surcharge is added on late at night (after around 22:00) and on Sundays. Tipping isn't expected. Make sure that drivers use the meter, or arrange a fare beforehand.\n\n\nFrom the bus terminal\nWalk up the stairs marked \"SALIDA\", then down the stairs into the car park. Ignore the taxi touts and catch a taxi from the rank. A taxi into the city centre during the day should cost around GS.40,000.\n\n\nFrom the airport\nTaxis in front of the terminal charge a flat, non-negotiable rate of GS.100,000 to the centre. It is possible to get a cheaper fare by walking up to the main road and taking a yellow cab from there, though you're unlikely to save any more than about GS.20,000.\n\n\nBy car\n\nDriving a car is an excellent way to explore the city and visiting the sights as many of them are off the downtown area (microcentro). It's strongly recommended using a GPS when renting a car since the city streets and avenues lack good signaling and finding your way around can be challenging. Traffic in Asunci\u00f3n has become chaotic specially during the rush hours from 06:30 to 09:00, at 12:00, and from 17:00-20:00 on weekdays. Consider that going into/out of the city can take no less than 1 hour. Highways to places nearby are in good condition. Car rental companies can also provide drivers.\nParking in the city centre is signposted on every block, although it could be hard to find a free place to park the car in the mornings. Parking costs US$0.40 per hour in the microcentro streets but only in the mornings (from 08:00 to 13:00) and only on weekdays. In the afternoons and on weekends parking is free. A special situation comes up when you are parking your car on the street, some people called cuidacoches (car watchers) (men and women, young and old) will approach you and offer you to look after your car when you leave it parked, after that they would expect you to tip them (no more than US$2) when you return to your car. This is a common situation throughout the city specially around major sights (including city parks) and restaurants. It could be annoying at first, but locals are accustomed to this practice and it will be better for you to accept the offer and, by doing so, avoid any kind of trouble. If you prefer not being bothered leave your car in a parking lot. There are many of them scattered around the city centre. Major shopping malls offer valet parking.\n\n\nBy boat\nThe old 6 Port of Asunci\u00f3n is at the riverside end of calle Col\u00f3n and El Paraguayo Independiente, where small motor boats and car ferries make the 25-minute river crossing to Chaco'\u00ed, a small town on the other side of the river where good views of Asunci\u00f3n can be observed. Make sure to return by sunset as there are no accommodation facilities or reasonable places to eat in Chaco'\u00ed.\nThe catamar\u00e1n Aguas del Paraguay offers one and two-hour touristic trips along the bay of Asunci\u00f3n and the river Paraguay. It departs from and returns to the same point in the costanera and only on weekends.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 National Congress of Paraguay (Palacio Legislativo), \u260f +595 21 414-5198. One of the more impressive new buildings in the city. It was built in 2002 with $20 million donation from the Republic of China (Taiwan) government. Paraguay is one of the few countries and also the only country in South America that recognizes Republic of China (Taiwan) as opposed to mainland China (People's Republic of China). Most striking is its mirrored fa\u00e7ade, which reflects the nearby slums along the bank of the river. You can ask for a tour in English; and maybe get one. Arrive by 13:00, so that you will be able to visit the small museum inside. \n2 Metropolitan Cathedral (Catedral Metropolitana). The national cathedral. Next to the broad and picturesque plaza Independencia.   (updated May 2017)\n3 Pante\u00f3n Nacional de los Heroes, Palma esquina Chile.

Changing of the guard occurs every other day. \n4 Centro Cultural El Cabildo, Avenida Rep\u00fablica y Alberdi (at one edge of Plaza Independencia), \u260f +595 21 443 094, contacto@cabildoccr.gov.py. Tu-F 09:00-20:00; Sa Su 10:00-17:00. One of the few museums that open on weekends it's in an old colonial building that was the Congress Palace until 2003. Near the riverside costanera it has various exhibition spaces. The Sala Museo del Barro is one of the sections which presents pieces of indigenous art from native groups of Paraguay and Latin America. Another permanent exhibition space is the Sala Agust\u00edn P\u00edo Barrios - Mangor\u00e9, which treasures the life and work of the great composer of the Paraguayan guitar. Another section is the Sala de la Escena Paraguaya - Edda de los R\u00edos which aims to disseminate everything related to the performing arts in Paraguay. There are also works from potter artist Julia Is\u00eddrez exhibiting a variety of clay works, in dark tone, with designs of faces, animals and nature figures. The Cabildo also incorporates works from traditional Christmas cribs by local artists such as Lucy Yegros, Gabriela Zuccolillo and Carlo Spatuzza. Free.   (updated Apr 2018)\n5 Casa de la Independencia, 14 de Mayo esquina Presidente Franco (one block down from Palma Street), \u260f +595 21 493918, info@casadelaindependencia.org.py.

(updated May 2017)\n15 Mirador Ita Pyta Punta, At the end of Calle Doctor Montero in Ita Pyta Punta neighbourhood (Few blocks away from final stops of Bus 56 and Bus 36). The name means red stone rock in Guaran\u00ed. Pleasant small park at one of the edges of the city. Attractive lookout over the river Paraguay with nice views of sunsets in the afternoons. Officially the lookout is \"temporarily\" closed and fenced off, but locals opened the doors through it. Ita Pyta Punta is not the safest neighbourhood at night. Maybe better accessible by taxi if you're alone. (updated Jan 2024)\n\n\nBeyond the city\nThere are many interesting sights within reach of 1 or 2 days tours from Asunci\u00f3n. Check out the Southern Parane\u00f1a region for these.\n\n\nDo\n Trade fair. Every July. An exhibition booths, food, music and liquor.

(updated Sep 2023)\n5 Estadio General Pablo Rojas. 45,000 capacity stadium home to Cerro Porte\u00f1o.   (updated Sep 2023)\n\n\nHistoric centre (walking tour)\nTo start walking the microcentro of Asunci\u00f3n go to the bottom of Calle Col\u00f3n, just before it corners El Paraguayo Independiente, are the colonial fa\u00e7ades of La Recova, an array of shops selling local arts and crafts. The river port and Aduana (customs) building are just in front. Continue east along Calle El Paraguayo Independiente to the Palacio de L\u00f3pez (government palace) from 1857. It was built in the style of Versailles by Alan Taylor as a palace for Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez. Directly opposite the palace is the Manzana de la Rivera, a museum and cultural centre complex comprising ten colonial-era houses, some of which date back from the 1700s and have been nicely restored. They include the Casa Viola, reportedly the oldest house of Asunci\u00f3n, which now houses the Museo Memoria de la Ciudad with historical photos and city information. Casa Clari with exhibition halls and a nice bar which has the best views over the government palace. Other spaces in the complex are the Miguel Acevedo Cultural Centre, the Ruy D\u00edaz de Guzm\u00e1n Auditorium, and Casa Vert\u00faa, which houses the municipal library.\nA block away east from the government palace is the Congreso Nacional, built in 2013 in steel and glass representing a huge ship moored on the river bank and incorporating part of the old congress building. Next to it, on Plaza de la Independencia there is a small memorial to those who died in the struggle for democracy in 1999. On the other sides of the plaza are the old Cabildo building (1844-54) now the Centro Cultural de la Rep\u00fablica with permanent exhibitions of indigenous and religious art, the Catedral Metropolitana (mid-17th century, rebuilt 1842-49) with an altar decorated with Jesuit and Franciscan silver. From the plaza turn right onto Alberdi and to your right is the Correos (post office) building, known previously as the Palacio Patri. It has a beautiful inside courtyard and a small philatelic museum. One block south at Alberdi and Presidente Franco is the Teatro Municipal fully restored to its belle \u00e9poque glory. Walk east on Presidente Franco for six blocks and there will be the Estaci\u00f3n del Ferrocarril (old railway station) at Eligio Ayala and Mexico. It was built in 1861-64 with British assistance. Paraguay had one of the first passenger railways in South America. There are no more trains running but there is a small museum featuring the old ticket office, machinery from Wolverhampton and Battersea and the first steam engine in Paraguay, the Sapucai from 1861. In front is the Plaza Uruguaya with its shady trees and a handful of bookstores. From here take Calle Mariscal Estigarribia west towards the Plaza de los H\u00e9roes where there will be the Pante\u00f3n Nacional de los H\u00e9roes at the corner of Palma and Chile, which is based on Les Invalides of Paris and finished in 1937. It contains the remains of former presidents, national war heroes and the unknown soldier. Plaza de los H\u00e9roes is actually made up of four separate squares with different names. These include Plaza Libertad and Plaza de la Democracia.\nOn Plaza Libertad, there are covered market stalls selling traditional Paraguayan arts and crafts in wood, cotton and leather. Along Palma, indigenous women sell colourful woven bags, beads and baskets. A few blocks further along Palma turn right at 14 de Mayo to reach the Casa de la Independencia (independence house) built in 1772 with a historical collection; it was the place where the 1811 independence revolution was plotted. The huge Iglesia de Encarnaci\u00f3n is three blocks up 14 de Mayo at its intersection with V\u00edctor Haedo, where the Museo Papa Francisco is. A small museum with all the relics related to the Pope Francis visit to Asunci\u00f3n in 2015.\n\n\nArchitectural tour\nIf you are particularly interested in architecture, the following are some important highlights:\n\n16 Loma San Jer\u00f3nimo\nMirador Ita Pyta Punta (see above)\n17 Col\u00e9gio Experimental Paraguay\u2011Brasil (CEPB) \u2013 by Affonso Eduardo Reidy\n18 Cultural Center of Spain Juan de Salazar\n19 Fundacion Texo \u2013 (open Thursdays)\nMuseo del Parro (see above) \u2013 (open Wednesdays)\n20 Telet\u00f3n Children\u2019s Rehabilitation Center \u2013 by Solano Ben\u00edtez, in Lambar\u00e9 (Asunci\u00f3n)\n21 Paraguayan Association of Golf (APG) \u2013 by Javier Corval\u00e1n (near the airport)\n\n\nLearn\n IDIPAR, Manduvir\u00e1 963 between Col\u00f3n and Montevideo, \u260f +595 21 44 78 96, idipar82@gmail.com. Offers courses in Spanish and Guarani for foreigners and several other services. (updated Mar 2017)\n\n\nWork\nTeaching English is a possibility, but without a visa it can be difficult and wages are low. In a country such as Paraguay with widespread underemployment, obtaining paid work is almost impossible for foreigners. Volunteer work in poorer areas of the city is easy to come by.\n\n\nBuy\nThe cost of buying goods and services is amazingly cheap, especially electronics. Some goods may be refurbished items, or cheaply made, or could be pirated or smuggled items. Always ask for a legitimacy or warranty certificate and if you have any doubt or do not trust the vendor, just go to another store. Commercial activity in the city centre closes from Saturday afternoon to all Sunday and the city may appear fairly deserted, but the bustle is in the neighbourhoods of Villa Morra, Carmelitas and the Business District where the main shopping centers, department stores, boutiques, caf\u00e9s, fast food, restaurants and cinemas are, and they don't close on weekends.\n\n\nIndigenous crafts and artisan work\nIndigenous crafts and artisan work are available such as tooled leather, carved wood, pottery and a particularly Paraguayan lace based on a spider's web called \"\u00d1andut\u00ed\". Check out the artisan shops in Plaza de los Heroes. Most goods are in fact locally made.\n\n\nShopping malls\nThere are two main malls in Asuncion: Shopping del Sol on Aviadores del Chaco and Shopping Mariscal L\u00f3pez on Avenida Mariscal Lopez, exist in the suburbs of Villa Mora and Carmelitas. Take buses 28 or 30 to reach them.\nMall Excelsior on Chile, and the more basic Asuncion Supercentro on the western end of Oliva are both in the centre. These \"Shoppings\" are useful as places to eat on Sunday evenings, when many more central places are closed.\n\n2 Shopping del Sol (delSol Shopping & Lifestyle), \u260f +595 21 606 909. (updated Apr 2023)\n3 Shopping Mariscal L\u00f3pez, Quesada 5050. (updated Apr 2023)\n4 Mall Excelsior, Manduvira, \u260f +595 21 443 015. (updated Apr 2023)\n5 Asuncion Super Centro, \u260f +595 21 493 333. (updated Apr 2023)\n\n\nMarkets\n6 Palma Street, Calle Palma. The main shopping street. Pretty much everything you can buy here, you can get cheaper in one of the parallel streets. \n7 Mercado 4, along Avenida Sivio Pettirossi. A chaotic market where you can buy just about anything very cheaply, it is particularly good for counterfeit clothing and pirated CDs and DVDs (of varying quality). Most Paraguayans still shop at local produce markets, but you can buy everything at great prices. Good street food and some foreign, mostly Chinese, restaurants. \n Sunday flea market, along calle Palma. From early morning until noon approximately. Several old men set up their tables selling trinkets, photographs and books. (updated May 2017)\nTypical souvenirs from Asunci\u00f3n would include guampas/bombillas, T-shirts, traditional lace, or leather goods.\n\n\nTraveller's cheques\nAmerican Express traveller's cheques can be changed at Banco de la Nacion Argentina (at Plaza de los Heroes). Above average exchange rate, US$3 commission. It will take a while though - time to experience the place which could be a sight in itself. BBVN supposedly does as well. Casa de Cambios don't. All banks close by 13:30. Also can be changed at Maxicambios which are in all main shopping malls.\n\n\nEat\n\nAt lunchtime there is no shortage of cheap restaurants to dine in or take away \u2013 you can't miss them. The places where you help yourself and pay by weight are usually very cheap and a decent option besides the slightly more expensive restaurants with their daily menu. At dinner time only very few eating places are still open and finding a good deal \u2013 especially if you are budget-conscious \u2013 is a lot harder.\n\n\nBudget\nMost shopping malls have decent food courts with a variety of restaurants, however, they are away from the centre. Bigger supermarkets often have cheap self-service restaurants inside.\nEat a streetside lomito- these vendors are found throughout the city, with high concentrations near Casa Rica and the \u00d1u Guazu. It is a sandwich, with mayo, veggies, cheese and a fried egg. You can choose between beef or chicken. Some also offer lomito arabe (shawarma), hamburgers and chorizo. It is a popular hang out place at nights and after a night of heavy drinking.\nDon Vito is Paraguayan fast food at its best. Home of the Paraguayan empanada, they have been in business for over 30 years. The original spot is just behind the Iglesia de San Jose, and if you are lucky enough to be in Paraguay around May\u2013June, you can order a pastel mandi'o, which is made of mandioca and beef. Best enjoyed with a cold pulp, a Paraguayan soft drink made with natural fruit juice.\n\n1 Burger King, Palma between 14 de Mayo and 15 de Agosto. If you fancy something you know. Also, open in the evening. \n2 \u00d1a Eustaquia, 421 Palma, past Lido's and the hall of martyrs, near Burger King. Very busy for lunch, you may need to wait for a table. Main lunches cost GS.15,000\u2013GS.25,000. Great juice bar there too. \n3 Seoul, Chile, near the intersection with Oliva (Plaza de los Heroes) and opposite an Esso petrol station. Open for lunch and dinner (19:30). Korean buffet, with many vegetarian options where you fill your plate and pay per weight. \n\n\nMid-range\n4 El Bolsi, corner Estrella and Alberdi, \u260f +595 21 491841, info@bolsi.com.py. Daily 24 hours. Opened in 1960, it's one of the oldest restaurants in town. It has a caf\u00e9 and pastry section, and a separate restaurant section. Also, an outdoor section on the sidewalk is pleasant in the evenings. International and local dishes. Very popular among locals and tourists. (updated May 2018)\n5 Lido Bar, corner of Palma and Chile (opposite Pante\u00f3n del los H\u00e9roes), \u260f +595 21 447332. 06:30-01:30. Established 1954 in the style of a contemporary American cafe-bar, Lido Bar has hardly changed. It was the first place Anthony Bourdain visited when he made his tv program on Paraguayan food. All the customers sit around a big circular bar. The menu offers Paraguayan foods, pasta, meat and a selection of desserts and fruit juices. The fish soup (sopa pescado) is famous and recommended. Very popular during peak times, particularly lunch and dinner. \n6 Hacienda Las Palomas, Senador Long 1481 (100m from Shopping Villa Morra in Villa Morra neighbourhood), \u260f +595 21 605-111. Really good Mexican food (not \"chips & salsa Tex-Mex\"). The margaritas are particularly good, but the food is even better. \n7 Shangri-La, Aviadores del Chaco c/ San Mart\u00edn (near Shopping del Sol), \u260f +595 21 661618, info@shangri-la.com.py. Good Chinese food. \n8 Bar San Roque, corner of Eligio Ayala and Tacuary (near Plaza Uruguaya Green building.). Open all day. One of the oldest restaurants in town. A mix of traditional and fine cuisine. Excellent food and service in a very traditional feeling atmosphere. Really fantastic beer on tap served in their chilled Oktoberfest steins. \n\n\nSplurge\nFor a traditional Paraguayan meal, visit \"La Paraguayita.\"\nDon't miss a Brazilian steak house called a \"churrasqueria.\"\n\n9 Acuarela, Avenida Mariscal L\u00f3pez 4049, near Avenida Rep\u00fablica Argentina (in Villa Morra neighbourhood), \u260f +595 21 609 217. Brazilian-style barbecue and steak restaurant. \n\n\nDrink\n\n\nBars and clubs\n\n1 Britannia Pub, Cerro Cor\u00e1 851 (next to Hotel Crowne Plaza), \u260f +595 21 443 990, britpub@rieder.net.py. Tu-F from 19:30, Sa-Su from 20:00. Popular hangout for locals and foreigners. Try their microbrewed Britannia Beer and the chicken platter. \n2 904 Bar, Cerro Cor\u00e1 904 (in front of Hotel Crowne Plaza), \u260f +595 986 230963. M-Th from 18:00, F from 17:00, Sa from 19:00. A lot like Britannia: similar food, similar drinks, similar prices. Has a pool table, and occasionally puts on live-music shows. \n3 Coyote, Sucre 1655 (100m from Avenida San Mart\u00edn), \u260f +595 21 414 111. Dance club, fashionable but loud (updated Oct 2017)\n4 Hollywood Dance, Independencia Nacional and Teniente Fari\u00f1a (One block away from Mall Excelsior), \u260f +595 981 906494. F and Sa from around midnight. Dance venue for mostly gay people. \n5 Paseo Carmelitas, \u260f +595 21 608226. from morning till late. Food plaza with a selection of bars and restaurants to go at noon for lunch and after office until late at night. One of the most popular places in Asuncion during the night and on weekends. \n6 La Tabernita, Chila 1179 between Avenida Ygatim\u00ed and Jeju\u00ed (near Plaza Italia), \u260f +595 21 453620, latabernacafe97@gmail.com. 07:00-15:00 and 18:30-late. A cafe bar with good atmosphere, good music, drinks and very friendly staff (if you like 1970s, 80s, 90s rock & pop). \n7 Casa Clari, Ayolas and Benjamin Constant (inside Manzana de la Rivera complex in front to Palacio de L\u00f3pez), \u260f +595 21 496 476. Really nice views of the L\u00f3pez Palace. Good food/drink menu, but slightly pricier than other bars in the centre. \n\n\nSleep\nThe lodging scene in Asunci\u00f3n has greatly improved. The hostel range, previously nonexistent, started business in the past decade and since then has seen a lot of new openings, especially in old houses of the historic city centre. On the other hand, many new modern hotels, including some luxury properties of international brands, have opened their doors in the new business district of Avenida Aviadores del Chaco and Avenida Santa Teresa. Finding a bed should not be difficult for the common traveller. The highest concentration of hotels from budget to splurge can be found in the historic city centre and the new business district. There are also quite a number of cheap places near the bus terminal, though you normally get better values in the city centre.\n\n\nCity Centre\nThe centro hist\u00f3rico is where the traditional hotels are found, some of them occupying beautiful buildings from the 1960s and even from the 19th century. This is also where the hostels are, so backpackers and budget travellers are normally found in this area.\n\n\nHostels\n\n1 Black Cat Hostel (temporarily closed, momentarily we only offer tourist advice), Eligio Ayala 129 casi Independencia Nacional (At the heart of city centre.

Under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner crime in any form was not tolerated. Crime is not prevalent, although the perception of crime is that it has been high since Stroessner's fall in 1989. Some houses are protected by 20 ft (6.1 m) high walls topped by barbed wire and electric fence or razor wire, and those who can afford it have a full-time guard on their grounds. Despite the locals' rather high perception of crime, Asunci\u00f3n is one of the safer capitals in South America and violent crime is very uncommon. Because there are few tourists in Paraguay, visitors are not likely to be specifically targeted by criminals. Key things to watch out for are petty thieves (watch your pockets on crowded buses) and taxi drivers trying to rip you off (make sure they use the meter). Pickpocketing is said to be prevalent in crowded downtown streets near expensive hotels.\nProstitution is rampant and obvious after dark on the main avenues in the outskirts and in small parts of the city center's oldest parts near the port. Transvestite prostitutes are common around many areas, and are best avoided as they are known to cause trouble occasionally. Female travellers will receive a lot of unwanted attention from Paraguayan men \u2013 this is mostly intended as innocent banter in the form of shouts or wolf whistles, etc., but can sometimes be accompanied by touching, especially in clubs. This sort of attention is best just ignored. Liquor is easily available but not widely abused, there are a fair few street drunks in some parts of the city, but they are invariably harmless.\nBe extremely careful when crossing streets in Asunci\u00f3n. Most drivers consider stop signs and traffic lights to be merely suggestions, even if police are nearby. Buses will stop for almost nothing, so be very careful.\nThe United States Centres for Disease Control recommends that all visitors to Asunci\u00f3n receive a typhoid vaccination prior to travel. Dengue fever is frequently a risk one takes when travelling to Asunci\u00f3n; there is no vaccine for this. To avoid insect-spread diseases, ensure that you use bug spray at all times of the day, without exception.\nThe \"Chacarita\" area by the river, next to the Palace is an extremely impoverished and dangerous part of the city, and is definitely not a place to go exploring.\n\n\nConnect\nMany restaurants, shopping malls and some public squares have free Wi-Fi.\n\n\nCope\nFlies, ants and especially mosquitoes (but no large, creepy bugs) are everywhere. There are no screens, windows and doors are simply flung open for ventilation. Air conditioners do exist but most people depend on less expensive fans. Heaters do not exist, though on the chilliest days they would be welcomed. The soil is bright red and as many streets are unpaved dust becomes a problem. There are trees (some in the middle of roads!) for shade, but palm trees are planted everywhere. Dogs and farm animals of every description are all over the roads. There is no humane society to care for wild dogs and some are pitifully mangy. It is not uncommon to see pigs wallowing in a mud puddle in the middle of a road, chickens are everywhere, horses, donkeys and cows run loose and can be found in anyone's property.\nIt is brutally hot in Paraguay's summer. If you've ever wondered why Latin culture has a \"siesta\" where everything closes down at noon for a few hours, you'll soon know why if you spend time in Asunci\u00f3n during the summer. You'll also understand why people eat dinner so late and stay out partying all night: it's too hot during the day to enjoy being outside.\n\n\nEmbassies\n 3 Argentina, Avenida Espa\u00f1a esq.
