The city is known as the National Capital of Sweets and has important European-style buildings. Whether you're a history enthusiast, a food lover, or simply looking to explore a lesser-known gem, Pelotas has something for everyone who visit.\n\n\nUnderstand\nWith around 320,000 inhabitants, Pelotas is the fourth largest city in Rio Grande do Sul and the second largest in the interior of the state. Known for its rich history, stunning architecture, unique cuisine and vibrant cultural festivals, Pelotas is a must-see destination for travelers looking to explore southern Brazil. \nThe city's colonial heritage is evident in its architecture, with a mix of styles ranging from neoclassical and neogothic to art deco. As you wander through the streets of Pelotas, you'll be greeted by splendid mansions, charming squares, and beautifully preserved buildings that showcase the city's historical grandeur.\nFounded in 1812, Pelotas was an important economic center during the 19th century, thanks to its role in the trade in charque, a type of jerky beef that was exported to many parts of the world and that was highly valued at the time. The wealth generated from the charque industry allowed Pelotas to flourish and become an important commercial center. Today, the legacy of this era can be seen in the city's opulent European-style mansions, which were once the residences of wealthy charque barons and ranchers.\nIn addition to its architectural beauty, Pelotas is famous for its culinary traditions, particularly its delightful sweets. The city's confectionery heritage is deeply ingrained in its culture, and visitors are treated to a wide array of traditional sweets and pastries. The doces de pelotas (Pelotas Sweets) made with skillful craftsmanship and using traditional recipes, are a true highlight of the local gastronomy. From the famous \"p\u00e9 de moleque\" to the mouthwatering \"quindim,\" these desserts are not to be missed.\nIn addition to its historical and gastronomic offerings, Pelotas is a city that embraces arts and culture. It is home to a thriving arts community, with theaters, museums and cultural centers showcasing local talent and creativity. The city also hosts a variety of festivals and events throughout the year, including music, theater and dance performances, attracting locals and tourists alike.\nPelotas' location close to the coast adds another dimension to its appeal. The town has beautiful beaches, providing opportunities for walks along the coast, water sports or just relaxing in the sun. Praia do Laranjal, located on the shores of Lagoa dos Patos, offers a serene natural refuge where visitors can enjoy the tranquility of the lake and the surrounding greenery.\n\n\nClimate\n\nPelotas has a humid subtropical climate, characterized by four distinct seasons throughout the year. The city experiences mild to hot summers and cool winters, with moderate rainfall distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. During the summer months of December to February, temperatures in Pelotas can reach highs of around 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). However, the coastal location of the city brings relief from the heat, as the sea breeze helps to moderate the temperatures. Summer is also the wettest season, with occasional thunderstorms and showers.\nAutumn (March to May) and spring (September to November) in Pelotas are mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (59\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F). These seasons offer comfortable weather for outdoor activities and sightseeing. Winter in Pelotas, from June to August, is relatively cool with temperatures ranging from 5\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C (41\u00b0F to 59\u00b0F). It is the driest season, with fewer rainfall events. Occasionally, temperatures can drop below freezing, especially during cold fronts, but snow is extremely rare in the region.\nTravelers visiting Pelotas should pack accordingly based on the season. Lightweight clothing and sunscreen are essential for the summer months, while warmer clothing and a jacket are recommended for autumn and spring. In winter, it is advisable to have a coat, hat, and gloves to stay comfortable in the cooler temperatures. Overall, Pelotas enjoys a mild climate throughout the year, making it a pleasant destination for travelers who appreciate a variety of seasons and enjoy exploring the city's attractions in different weather conditions.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nJo\u00e3o Sim\u00f5es Lopes Neto International Airport (PEL  IATA) is the only airport serving the city. The airport is located 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) from the city downtown. It is a small airport, therefore, it has only one room for departures and arrivals and do not expect great amenities, such as a food court, for example. Azul flies from Porto Alegre to Pelotas from Monday to Friday. VoePass has flights from Porto Alegre to Pelotas on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Flights from Guarulhos on Gol are also available on Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Taxis are available at the entrance and exit of the airport.\n\n\nBy bus\nExpresso Embaixador operates the intercity bus route between Porto Alegre and Pelotas, taking 3 hours and 15 minutes in a comfortable executive bus. \nThe Pelotas Bus Terminal is located about 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) to the city downtown. Taxis are available in front of the bus station.\n\n\nBy car\nThe only access route from Porto Alegre to Pelotas and other cities in the south is the BR-116 highway. The route is approximately 260 km. The stretch can be covered in about three hours and has several tolls. Despite the tolls, the quality of the asphalt is not very good and few stretches have a duplicate lane. It is important to be aware of traffic conditions, especially during long holidays, when traffic on the roads can be intense. It is also recommended to check the weather conditions before travelling, as heavy rains can affect the visibility and grip of the track.\n\n\nGet around\nThe best way to explore Pelotas is on foot, as many of the city's main attractions are located in a relatively small area. The city downtown, known as \"Centro Hist\u00f3rico\", is particularly pleasant to explore on foot, as it has a well-preserved collection of historic buildings and squares. However, for those who want to venture out and get to know more of Pelotas' natural beauties, such as Praia do Laranjal, for example, taxis and ride services are readily available.\n\n\nSee\n\nPelotas offers a wealth of architectural and cultural attractions that are sure to captivate any visitor.
