  "extract": "By many considered to be the most beautiful city of the country, Maastricht is the southernmost city in the Netherlands. It's the capital of the province of Limburg and famous for what the Dutch call the \"Burgundian\" way of life. Dutch and international visitors alike flock in to enjoy this \"joie de vivre\" and indulge in the many fine dining, arts, culture and shopping opportunities in town. The river Maas runs through the city, offering some scenic views, and the lovely cobblestoned centre is full of historic buildings and impressive cathedrals. Whether you're here for sightseeing or just to shop till you drop, this is a great place to spend some time.\n\n\nUnderstand\nSituated within walking distance of Belgium and cycling distance of Germany, Maastricht claims to be the oldest city in the Netherlands (a claim it shares with Nijmegen). It is an especially popular tourist destination in the Netherlands because of its historical old centre and broad shopping possibilities. The city is home to approximately 122,000 people (2019). The University of Maastricht attracts many national and foreign students to the city. Geographically, the city is split in half by a major river (the Maas), with the majority of commercial activity being concentrated on the Western bank of the river, and the train station and the Bonnefanten Museum on the Eastern side.\n\n\nTourist information\nThe VVV is a branch office of the Dutch national tourist agency. The office offers maps, souvenirs, and local, regional, and national travel suggestions. It is at Kleine Staat 1, in the city center. For information about all cultural events in Maastricht, try to find a copy of the Week in Week uit. They are distributed all around the city. Maastricht.nl is the city government website.\n\n\nTalk\nDue to its location close to the border, large and internationally oriented events and of course the many foreign students and visitors, you'll find that plenty of Maastricht's inhabitants speak languages besides their own. Don't worry if you don't speak Dutch, as you'll be well able to get by with English, German or sometimes even French. Locals amongst each other typically speak the city dialect Maastrichtian, a variant of Limburgish, which is widely spoken in the region. Even for Dutch natives from the north, this tonal dialect is not necessarily intelligible. Although Maastrichtian seems to be losing words and grammar as younger generations use it, it is still widely used and locals tend to be proud of it; street signs in the city are often dual language, showing both the Dutch and the Maastrichtian name.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Maastricht-Aachen Airport (MST  IATA). The small airport sees a limited number of flights from selected cities in southern Europe. Most flights are seasonal and all are operated by discount carriers.   \nMaastricht-Aachen Airport can be reached by bus with Veolia route 59, Maastricht-Sittard and vice versa, and stops at Maastricht train station. A ticket from the Maastricht train station to the airport costs \u20ac4.50.\nCentrally located in the Euregion, major airports in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany can be convenient from travellers to Maastricht.\n\nAmsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS IATA) is the country's main airport with a wide array of international connections to all parts of the world. It is over 2\u00bd hours from Maastricht by train, requiring a change in either Amsterdam, Utrecht or Sittard along the way.\nBrussels Airport (BRU IATA) the main airport of neighbouring Belgium is a good alternative as it also serves a long list of international destinations. It's about a 2-hr drive, but a train trip to Maastricht requires transfers in Brussels North and Li\u00e8ge. Private taxi and minibus transfers are available.\nD\u00fcsseldorf Airport (DUS IATA) is only a 70 min drive, but the train trip takes about 2\u00bd hr. There is however a bus run by DB that does the trip from D\u00fcsseldorf Central Bus Station to Maastricht in 1\u00bd hr.\nA number of other, smaller airports with low cost carrier connections are within easy reach of Maastricht. Eindhoven Airport (90 min), Rotterdam The Hague Airport (2\u00bd hr), Brussels South Charleroi Airport, Weeze Airport (NRN) in Germany and Cologne-Bonn Airport (also in Germany) are all worth checking out for common discount carrier destinations.\n\n\nBy train\nMaastricht is well served by train, with 2 Maastricht train station, near the centre of the city, and  3 Randwyck train station, in the south. There are two trains departing from Maastricht Station to the northern destinations every hour. Some popular destinations include:\n\nPrices in this table are one-way and non-reduced fare. For more information check the NS English language website. Local trains will take you to Valkenburg, Heerlen & Kerkrade, four times every hour.\nComing from Germany with the Deutschland-Ticket just put in the destination Maastricht on the DB app or website and choose \"regional/local transport only\". You have 2 options:\n\u2022 Taking a train (every 30 min) from Aachen or Herzogenrath to Maastricht. Here you need to buy an extra ticket from Herzogenrath to Maastricht for \u20ac9 (Feb 2024).\n\u2022 Taking the bus line 350 (every 15 min) from Aachen to Maastricht. Here you need an extra ticket for Vaals-Maastricht for about \u20ac6 (Feb 2024).\n\n\nRail travel in the Netherlands\nThere is an extensive rail system in the Netherlands. Travelling by train is generally a good experience in the Netherlands, although Dutch people will often complain that the trains are late and full. National train services are run by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), and an elaborate timetable system including price information is available on their website. Prices for trips are determined by distance, with longer distances costing less per km than shorter ones. Tickets can be bought at the ticket office in the train station's main hall, but you can save yourself an extra service fee by buying your train ticket from a yellow-and-blue electronic ticketing machine (note that some machines only accept European pin passes/debit cards and only older machines accept coins). Wherever you plan to buy your ticket, make sure you buy it before boarding the train, as it is not possible to buy a ticket on-board and you'll risk a \u20ac35 fine (in addition to the ticket price). Tickets can be bought as either one way tickets, or as a same-day or same weekend return. If you plan to return in the course of a couple of days, you should simply buy two separate one way tickets.\n\n\nInternational trains\nAn hourly service connects Maastricht with Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. Although there is no longer a direct, high-speed connection between Maastricht and Brussels, Belgium, you can catch an express train in Li\u00e8ge and take it to Brussels. From there you can switch trains to Paris and London.\nAn hourly service also connects Maastricht with Aachen, which is linked to the rest of Germany by ICE trains.\nFor further information on international train journeys, check timetables and train fares at the Belgian Railways, the French Railways , or  German Railways websites.\n\n\nBy car\nThere a two motorways from and to Maastricht: A2 (Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Sittard, Belgium and France - \"Route du Soleil\") and A79 (Heerlen, Aachen).\n\n\nBy bus\n4 Maastricht long distance bus station. Flixbus for example stops here. \nBus 350 from Aachen serves Maastricht every 15 min all days. Generally, travellers pay about \u20ac8 (Feb 2024) for a one-way ticket. Travel time is approximately one hour from Aachen. See 9292.nl for timetables.\nBelgian busses come and go to Hasselt, Tongeren, Lanaken and Li\u00e8ge.\nSemi tours travels on Tuesday (\"Utorak\") to/from Bosnia via Belgium, passing Maastricht, to Amsterdam. Return trip around \u20ac150, reservation by phone at the Belgian office. Bus stops at the central station.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy foot\nThis is by far the most attractive option as it allows travellers to see the beautiful winding streets in the centre of the city, as well as experience the cultural melting pot that Maastricht's location allows. A particularly nice walk outside of the centre is along the river, from St Servaas Brug (The Stone Bridge near the entrance to the city) down to the JFK Bridge (near the bottom), which goes through Maastricht's largest park. Visitors can then cross the JFK bridge and go to Maastricht's modern art museum - the Bonnefanten (see below).\nMaastricht Running Tours offers guided city jogging tours in Maastricht or their green surroundings. During tours you get to see more and you do your work out at the same time. The Highlight tours is about 6 km (1\u00bd hours). During several stops on the tour you get to hear the interesting stories behind the most interesting sights of the old historical center. The pace is very easy and adapted to the group. If that is still too much exercise you can pick up a City Walking Tour Guide (\u20ac1.60) from the VVV Tourist Office at Kleine Staat 1 and tour the town at your own pace.\n\n\nBy bike\nThere are thousands of bicycles in Maastricht, often the young gents giving their girlfriends a lift on the parcel carrier at the back, with the girls sitting \"side saddle\". A charming sight, and you can join in the bicycle culture very easily, there are several bicycle hire shops in Maastricht. You can explore the flat country of South Limburg. Dutch traffic law is heavily biased towards the cyclist, so you might find cars slowing down to let you pass when they are pulling in to a side street which you are about to cross - no sane car driver is going to cut you off since in the case of an accident the cyclist is always presumed innocent unless grossly negligent. Also while there are many one-way streets in Maastricht, almost all (if not all) of them have a cycle lane going the other way up the street.\nMaastricht Gulpen Cycle Route (53 km). Exploring the river valleys of South Limburg.\nMaastricht Pietersberg Cycle Route (21 km). Ancient quarries and forts along the River Meuse.\nMaastricht-Biking offers 2 hour guided city tours off the beaten track.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe city has a bus system called the Stadsbus (\"City Bus\") that travels over most of the city and to surrounding areas. Tickets can be bought on the bus, or you can buy an OV-chipkaart. It is a magnetic card which you can recharge with chosen amount of money (minimum \u20ac5). This card costs \u20ac7.50 and can be bought at the train station, also at the vending machine at the station or in the Veolia Transport service point (Veolia is Maastricht's bus transport company). When you enter the bus, you have to put the card close to the yellow card reader which will 'check you in' at the beginning stop. When you go out from the bus, you have to do it again to 'check out'. The amount of money for the trip will be taken from your card. It is much cheaper than buying a ticket from the bus driver.\n'Strippenkaart' is no longer valid in Maastricht.\n\n\nBy car\nTravelling by car can be painful in Maastricht, largely because most of the city centre is pedestrian-only, constant roadworks and closed roads, and also due to the horrendous (\u20ac2.60 an hour, max 2 hours per ticket placement) parking rates. It is often easier to park your car outside the town centre and either walk or bus into the city.\nIf you need to park for the day, try one of the parking areas on the edge of the centre such as:\n\nthe free (for 48 hours) P+R Maastricht Nord, which is right at a bus station with a 10 minute ride to the city centre, a day ticket with return costing \u20ac2 p.p for 2 or \u20ac5 for 3-5 people\nthe Spinx, which costs \u20ac2.30 an hour but with a maximum day charge of \u20ac9\nthe Stadtpark parking under the west side of the Kennedybrug (bridge), which costs \u20ac1.40 an hour, \u20ac6 for day ticket\nMachines take coins and local EC cards.\n\n\nBy train\nTrains run four times per hour between Maastricht Centraal Station, and Maastricht Randwyck station (at the South of the City), at a cost of \u20ac2.20.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nCity Centre\n\nPerhaps one of the best (free) sights of Maastricht is simply to admire the two town squares in the centre of the city and the many old buildings around the street near the university and town wall:\n\n1 Vrijthof. This famous square is considered by many to be the beating heart of the old city. It features the massive St Servaas Church and St Jan's Cathedral and hosts a range of large festivals throughout the year. The Carnival before Lent is an amazing occasion where (it seems) the whole city dresses up in costume and parties until the early hours. It really has to be seen to be believed, this is a North European Mardi Gras, hence colder and darker than its American cousin.   \n2 St Servaas (Servatius) Basilica. This basilica is believed to be built on top of the grave of Saint Servatius. The first known bishop of the Netherlands, he is said to have died here in the 4th century. The current grand, Romanesque structure in the shape of a cross was first built around the year 1000, and substantially expanded over the centuries. Pope John Paul II made the church a basilica after his visit here in 1985. Today, this enormous structure can only be viewed by paying a \u20ac5 entrance fee, which includes the cloister and a small museum of religious treasures. Enter from the Keizer Karelplein, NW of the Vrijthof. \n\n3 Onze Lieve Vrouwebasiliek (Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption). Commonly known as the Star of the Sea, after an old title for the Virgin Mary, this Romanesque church was largely built in the 11th and 12th century. Although no archaeological research has been carried out, historians believe earlier churches stood on the same spot before. Large parts of the church treasures were lost when the city became part of the First French Republic. The church was then used as a blacksmith workshop by the military, and the cloister area served as stables. The basilica's two narrow towers, topped with marlstone turrets, make it an important landmark for Maastricht and the charming little chapel is a popular place with both locals and tourists to light a candle. Inside, the miraculous statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea is perhaps the main attraction.   \n\n4 Market & Town Hall. The fairly large market square has been the stage for markets for centuries, and still houses goods markets on Wednesdays and Fridays. It's a lively square, surrounded by caf\u00e9s, shops and eateries, but also home to the 17th century Town Hall. It was designed by Pieter Post and is an excellent example of Dutch Baroque architecture. \n5 Town wall. South of the town centre, the wall includes the Helpoort (Hell's Gate), the oldest city gate in the Netherlands. \n\n\nCivic buildings\n6 City Library (Centre Ceramique), Plein 1992. \n7 University Maastricht Library (centre), Grote Looierstraat 17. \n8 University Maastricht Library (Randwyck), Universiteitssingel 50. \n9 Stadhuis (Town Hall) (in the Markt). \n\n\nMuseums\n\n10 Bonnefantenmuseum, Avenue C\u00e9ramique 250, \u260f +31 43 329 01 90, fax: +31 43 329 01 99, info@bonnefanten.nl. Tu-Su 11:00-17:00; M closed, except on public holidays. The museum is the foremost museum of Old Masters and contemporary art in the province of Limburg. The contemporary art collection contains works by an international group of artists, including Sol LeWitt. In addition to contemporary paintings, the collection also includes projections and gallery-sized installations. The collection of Old Masters emphasises 16th- and 17th-century Flemish paintings, including major works by Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens. In addition, the collection comprises magnificent medieval sculptures by Jan van Steffenswert, early Italian paintings and a presentation of Maastricht silver.

The museum is not wheelchair accessible. Before the restoration of the Derlon Hotel started, Maastricht's city archeologists undertook an extensive survey of the site. The Roman finds, from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th century, are considered that important that it was decided to conserve them and exhibit these to interested parties. The following can be seen in the cellar of Derlon Hotel: part of a 2nd and 3rd century sanctuary (including a Jupiter column), a 3rd century well, part of a pre- Roman cobblestone road and sections of a wall and a gate dating from the 4th century. Free entry. \n13 Natuurhistorisch Museum, De Bosquetplein 7, \u260f +31 43 350 54 90, fax: +31 43 350 54 75, mail@nhmmaastricht.nl. M-F 10:00 - 17:00; Sa Su 14:00 - 17:00.

A network of bunkers on the west side of Maastricht from which soldiers fired at invaders; again, tours are essential. \n\n\nDo\n\n\nCarnival\n\nFew Dutch cities take their carnival celebrations as seriously as Maastricht and when the weather is nice, the omnipresent music, laughter, costumes and parades might even make you think of Rio. It's a major happening and the highlight of the year for many of the locals. For a day or three, virtually all of regular life comes to a standstill as the mayor symbolically hands over the key of the city to Prince Carnaval, who is always accompanied by his jester and \"council of eleven\" advisors. Shops, museums and other institutions close their doors and people from all over the country flock to Maastricht to join in the merry celebrations that go on from late in the morning till the early hours of the next.\n\n\nStart of the season\nThe whole thing -locals call it Vasteloavend rather than carnival- starts as early as November. As eleven is the fool's number, the carnival season is opened at the 11th of the 11th, at 11:11. The Vrijthof is the stage for the first events and the first appearances of Maastricht's zate hermenikes, or drunken bands. They are small music bands, often in costume, often deliberately performing in a slightly amateurish way. A \"blue ship\" travellers the streets, a tradition going back to the 12th century and linked to the theme of Hieronymus Bosch's painting: The ship of fools. For outsiders, things may seem quiet after that, until the actual spring celebrations, but in reality numerous parties are organized behind closed doors during those months, typically involving a satiric sort of stand-up comedy in local dialect.\n\n\nMain events\nFor outsiders, the spring celebrations are most interesting. Dates vary as they are related to Easter, but the main events take places on Saturday to Tuesday.\n\nOn Saturday the new prince takes over town, parading (usually at 13:11) from the central station to the market square, where the mock-transition of power takes place.\nSunday sees the main parade, full of colourful carts, individual acts and thousands of spectators in costume. It leaves around 13:55 from Wijck and travellers towards the city centre. Princes (some city districts or clubs have their own, and some from neighbouring towns join the parade) throw candy on the crowds.\nMonday is family-day, with a children's parade pulling through the centre, towards the Vrijthof.\nThe Zate hermenikesconcours on Tuesday has all the little bands roaming the streets, competing to impress a jury on the Vrijthof. Be warned that the music is only part of the competition, and it's a funny show rather than a concert. On Wednesday, the day after, caf\u00e9s all over town serve raw herring or head cheese with rye bread to their guests.\nGreen, yellow and red are the official carnival colours and alaaf! is heard everywhere as a greeting. Dressing up is not obliged, but you don't want to be and outsider, pick up at least a few carnival gadgets (widely available in the days before).\n\n1 Lumi\u00e8re, Bogaardenstraat 40b, \u260f +31 43 321 40 80.

A two-floor high central spine both increases the number of books on display and gives you the chance to admire the architecture of the ceiling close up. There is also a small coffee bar. (updated Feb 2022)\n\n\nEat\nThere are many excellent places to eat in the town. Key areas to peruse are around Onze Lieve Vrouweplein, Vrijthof, Maaspromenade and Wycker Brugstraat. Also around Tongersestraat, close to the Economics and Law faculties of the Universiteit Maastricht.\nEating out in Maastricht is not always cheap, with most restaurants catering more to a posh older crowd rather than the student population. On weekdays there are a number of good and relatively low-priced sandwich outlets, as well as the usual fries based take-aways.\n\n\nBudget\n\n\nCity centre\n1 Cato by cato, Stenenbrug 9A (from Vrijthof, follow Bredestraat and Hondstraat for about 300 m), \u260f +31 651098619, info@catocatering.nl.

(updated Feb 2024)\n\n\nDrink\nMaastricht has many bars, restaurants, pubs and dance clubs, located on Vrijthof and Market Squares, and in the centre of downtown it's nearly impossible to walk around and not see anything to do.\n\nMaastricht is great for a night out (Maastricht is home to both a University & Institute). Therefore, lots of students, also lots of foreign companies are based here so a mixture of international pubs & clubs can be found here.\n\n\nBars\nBe sure to check out these places to go drink and have a good time:  The Highlander, Falstaff, Twee Heeren, Metamorfoos, C'est La Vie, Take5, De Allabonneur, and especially the make!-bar.  They all are very welcoming and have great music to dance to.\n1 Take One, Rechtstraat 28, \u260f +31 43  321 64 23. Th-M 16:00-02:00.

Baguettes and cakes with a tea, coffee or hot chocolate. \n5 Caf\u00e9 de Zwaan, Markt 68, \u260f +31 43 321 5421. Good for just a coffee or for small meals. \n\n\n\"Coffeeshops\"\nIn the Netherlands, the policy regarding soft drugs (such as weed, hash and magic mushrooms) is lenient. Therefore, there are several coffee- and headshops where you can buy these products. You can buy up to 5 grams of marijuana. Make sure you bring your identification card or driver's licence with you, because the shops are very strict about age and they will check it no matter how old you look. You have to be at least 18 years old to enter a coffee- or headshop. As of May 1, 2012, only those with a Dutch passport and clubpass are being allowed entry.[1]\nThe coffeeshops in Maastricht have a lot (2.2 million annually!) of foreign customers, so they are able to understand Dutch, English, French and German. The Mississippi boat is the most popular with coffeeshop visitors from abroad. It is a coffee shop built in a large boat which lays in the Maas river and is certainly worth visiting. However it is regarded as having overpriced products and lower quality by locals and connoisseurs. Recommended are; Black Widow, a small coffeeshop located outside of the city centre that has reasonable prices and good quality, Easy Going for its centrality and Heaven 69 for the open roof diner. Club 69, just around the corner of the Cool Running, is the oldest, smallest but most laid back one in town. For tourists other than Dutch, German or Belgian, there is a coffeeshop at Koestraat near the Beluga restaurant that is outside of the \"union\" and will serve you.\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nBudget\n1 Botel Maastricht, Maasboulevard 95, \u260f +31 43 321 90 23, fax: +31 43 325 79 98.

This hostel opened its doors in 2007 and offers 38 rooms. It has a deck looking over the Maas river and is a delightful place to have a beer in the evening. The hostel is clean, but as with many chain hostels, it does not have a kitchen and may lack atmosphere for those looking to meet other travellers. Prices start at \u20ac21 (breakfast included) for an overnight stay in a dormitory. \n\n\nMid-range\n3 Bastion Deluxe Hotel Maastricht, Boschstraat 27, \u260f +31 43 321 22 22, fax: +31 43 321 34 32. Part of a Dutch chain of four star hotels at sub-four star prices. If you are used to the full four-star service this will be a disappointment, but it is only a five-minute walk into the city centre and provides free wireless internet service. \n4 Design Hotel Eden, Stationsstraat 40, \u260f +31 43 328 25 25, fax: +31 43 328 25 26, info.designhotel@edenhotelgroup.com. If you're bored with identi-kit hotel rooms, Design Hotel Eden will be a breath of fresh air. All the rooms are comfortably furnished in a variety of modern styles. You'll appreciate a philosophy that doesn't put a desk in your room. \n5   Hotel De Pauwenhof, Boschstraat 70, \u260f +31 43 350 33 33, fax: +31 43 350 33 39, info@pauwenhof.nl.

Just off the market place, must be owned by a group of dentists. Little jars of sweets are everywhere in the public spaces. \n8 NH Hotel Maastricht, Forum 110, \u260f +31 43 383 82 81, fax: +31 43 361 58 62, nhmaastricht@nh-hotels.com. About a 25 minutes' walk from the city center, but very convenient if you are attending a conference or fair in the Maastricht Exhibition & Congress Centre next door. The hotel is comfortable enough; however, only the \"deluxe\" rooms really come up to the standards of other NH hotels. The standard rooms look tired by comparison, and some of them are quite noisy. \n9 Au Lion d'Or, Hoogbrugstraat 16, \u260f +31 6 46 13 40 51, info@auliondor.nl. Traditional 18th-century building is full of old details, carefully restored, and comprises a front and a back house.

In cooler weather, an open fire and traditional cooking range warmly welcome you to breakfast in the family kitchen in the back house. Two double guest rooms are on the second floor of the front house (up a set of steep Dutch stairs). Each non-smoking guest room has comfortable boxspring beds, its own private bathroom and WC, free wireless internet, and its own unique atmosphere. \u20ac115.

Large, good quality rooms. Free minibar (contains a few drinks). Free Internet. In town parking spaces (but not cheap).

A beautifully renovated Gothic monastery in the centre, complete with a church, is a rather spectacular stage for an unusually stylish hotel. \n\n\nTalk\nMaastricht is a very multilingual city, and it is not uncommon to regularly hear people speaking Dutch, English, French and German. In addition, many locals speak in the widespread local dialect Maastrichts, which is a variety of Limburgish. Street names tend to be written in both Dutch and Maastrichts, which has a French influence. Consequently, there are many languages to learn in Maastricht, both in the city or through lessons.\n\n\nStay safe\nAs with much of the Netherlands, Maastricht is a safe city if you are not looking for trouble. Pickpocketing and muggings have been known to occur in less tourist-friendly parts of the city, but tourists are rarely targeted.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nReligious services\nEl Fath Mosque.

The cemetery is just west of the village of Margraten. Open daily except for December 25 and January 1; 09:00 to 17:00. The cemetery is the final resting place for 8,301 American military dead. A monument is inscribed with the names of 1,723 Americans whose remains were never found or identified. The site contains a chapel and museum with three engraved operations maps describing the European Campaign.\nCaves in the Sint Pietersberg: Although the limestone caves are actually mines, it is nice to take a guided tour through the belly of the berg. In the Second World War, the Dutch stored their national arts collections in a vault in the hill, and a lot of engravings - some more old than the other - are to be admired. Entrances lie at several places on the mountain, and are well within walking distance of the town center. Plan in advance to make sure you can get in.\nFort Eben-Emael: A Belgian World War II fort no longer in use, but open to the public on certain weekends.  Very close to Maastricht, just south across the Belgian border.\nValkenburg aan de Geul: This historic town was besieged many times and many traces remain to be seen, including Valkenburg castle. Along with tours of the old mines there is also a popular spa and a casino.",
