  "extract": "Alpes-Maritimes is a department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region of France. It has 300 sunny days per year, making it an excellent tourist destination.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Antibes\n2 Beaulieu-sur-Mer \n3 Cannes \u2014 a sea-side city known for hosting the Cannes Film Festival, la Croisette (its waterfront) and its luxury hotels.\n4 Castillon\n5 \u00c8ze \u2014 a small atmospheric perched medieval village with a great view on the coast, and also a sea resort in its lower portion.\n6 Grasse \u2014 famous for its perfume industry \u2014 is inland but easily reached from the coast by train\n7 Cagnes-sur-Mer\n8 La Trinit\u00e9\n9 Monaco \u2014 a wealthy city-state on the Mediterranean Sea with entertainment for those with money to burn: think yachts and casinos, plus the annual Formula 1 Grand Prix.\n10 Menton\n11 Mougins\n12 Nice \u2014 The largest city of the d\u00e9partement, its famous promenade, its old town.\n13 Peillon\n14 Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat\n15 Saint-Paul de Vence and Tourrettes sur Loup \u2014 both 30 minutes inland but well worth a visit, delightful old villages with narrow streets and picture postcard scenes\n16 Sospel\n17 Tourrettes-sur-Loup\n Valbonne and Biot\n18 Vence, famous for the Matisse Chapel\n19 Villefranche-sur-Mer\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 La Pointe de l'Aiguille \u2014 a departmental park\n2 Mercantour National Park \u2014 a good place for hiking and skiing\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe department can be divided into three parts:\n\nThe coast area, which attracts lots of tourists\nThe arri\u00e8re-pays famous for its nice villages\nThe mountain area, with its ski resorts\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport (A\u00e9roport de Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur) (6 km east from the centre of Nice; see Nice for details). (NCE IATA) This is the third airport of the country in term of traffic, though it is not the main hub of any company. It offers a good number of national and international destinations, some of them covered by low-cost company EasyJet. Flying may be a good option if you are not travelling along the Mediterranean coast in which case the train may be more convenient.   (updated Mar 2015)\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy train\nThe main lines run along the coast, and allow going either to Italy (east) or Marseille (west). The local trains are following the two following lines:\n\nVentimiglia (Italy) - Menton - Monaco - Nice - Antibes - Cannes - Mandelieu-la-Napoule\nVentimiglia (Italy) - Menton - Monaco - Nice - Antibes - Cannes - Grasse\nTrains also stop in smaller cities (see time table).\nFrom Nice, high-speed train TGV runs to Lyon or Paris, with a few stops in-between. The portion between Nice and Marseille (2:40) is not operated at high-speed.\nThe SNCF, the national railway company, also operates the line train des Merveilles from Nice to the hinterland(Breil-sur-Roya, Tende). This train is often used by tourists.\nThe region also operated the line Chemin de fer de Provence between Nice and Digne-les-Bains in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence departments in the nord. This line is also often referred as Le train des Pignes. It's also serving many small villages as Puget-Th\u00e9niers, Entrevaux or Annot. Interrail cards are not accepted. The trains are not equipped for disable people.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe Conseil G\u00e9n\u00e9ral (local council) operates a bus network called TAM. It offers to route to almost every town and village within the d\u00e9partement. The one-way ticket costs \u20ac1 whatever the destination.\nThe main routes are:\n\n100: Nice - Monaco - Menton (every 15 minutes)\n100X'press: Nice - Monaco, direct by motorway (every 60 minutes)\n200: Nice - Cannes (every 15 minutes)\n500: Nice - Grasse\n600: Cannes - Grasse (every 20 to 30 minutes)\nThis network also operates (on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and the nights before a public holiday) a night service called NocTAM'bus. The three night routes are:\n\nNocTAM'bus 100: Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport - Monaco - Menton\nNocTAM'bus 200: Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport - Cannes\nNocTAM'bus 600: Cannes- Grasse\nThere are also two special airport routes:\n\n110 Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport - Monaco - Menton, direct by motorway\n210 Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport - Cannes, direct by motorway.\nWarning Special fares apply on the airport routes (110 and 210):\n\nNice - Monaco: \u20ac16.10\nNice - Menton: \u20ac18\nNice - Cannes: \u20ac14.20\nTime tables are available online [1] (in French)\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nStay safe\nThe Alpes-Maritimes are moderately safe from a tourist standpoint. Rural areas are very safe for the most part, whereas Nice and its immediate suburbs have their share of crimes, both petty and serious. Being street-smart and avoiding areas off-the-beaten-track are enough to avoid trouble. If you ever feel unsafe, calling the police or seeking help from hotels will help.\nPolitically-speaking, the Alpes-Maritimes are one of France's most conservative regions, and far-right politicians perform exceptionally well here, among the young and elderly alike. People who lean left or are visibly non-white are much more likely to face resentment than in other parts of France, and anti-LGBTQ sentiments are not uncommon.\n\n\nGo next",
