  "extract": "Vit\u00f3ria, the small and cozy capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo, is a city on the southeast coast of Brazil, famous for its beaches and culture, and for its proximity from many other tourist destinations in the state. Most of the city's neighborhoods are surrounded by parks and forests and many cultural events add an extra bliss to the city throughout the year. One might also consider staying in a hotel in Vit\u00f3ria while visiting nearby cities and regions of interest during the day like Vila Velha, Guarapari, Domingos Martins, or Serra, all of them with many attractions less than 2 hours away by car or bus. Vit\u00f3ria is also a perfect stop for travelers planning to go from the state of Rio de Janeiro or east of Minas Gerais by bus or car to beach destinations in the south of Bahia, like Prado, Caravelas and Abrolhos, or even Porto Seguro.\n\n\nUnderstand\nVit\u00f3ria, with around 360,000 people (2015), is considered by the UN to be the fourth best place to live in Brazil.\n\n\nHistory\nFounded in 1551, is the third oldest capital of Brazil, after Salvador and Recife. For a long time it was only a \u2018city-port\u2019, suffering various French, British and Dutch attacks, after sugar and \u2018pau-brasil\u2019.\nIts name is attributed to a victory over the native Indians, when, seeking refuge, the Portuguese fled to the island, and then achieved victory, renaming the village, at the time known only as \u201cVila Nova\u201d, to \u201cVila Nova da Vit\u00f3ria\u201d. It has many nicknames, like Ilha do Mel (Honey Island), Cidade Sol (Sun City) and others.\n\n\nGeography\nIt is located in the southeastern region of Brazil, the most developed in the country. It is close to the big urban centers, being on average, one hour away by plane from S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte.\nCircled by the Bay of Vit\u00f3ria, the main island has mangroves, beaches, granite formations and many smaller islands.\nThe municipality of Vit\u00f3ria is made of an archipelago with 34 islands and a continental area. Its total area is 104 km\u00b2, including the main island, the continental area, the coastal islands and the oceanic islands of Trindade and Martin Vaz. It used to have more than 50 islands, but now many of them have been incorporated, by landfills, to the main island.\nThe highest point is the Maci\u00e7o da Fonte Grande, a granite formation 309 meters tall, and then there is the Pedra dos (Dois) Olhos, 296 meters tall.\nThe climate is tropical humid, with a maximum average temperature of 30.4\u00baC and a minimum of 24\u00baC, with most of the rainfall in the months between October and January.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport (VIX  IATA) (located near the north end of Camburi beach). It receives daily flights from most state capitals in the country, mostly via Rio de Janeiro (the nearest gateway), S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte or Salvador. Among the main airlines serving the airport are LATAM and Gol. Smaller carriers that serve the airport include Azul, TEAM, and TRIP. \nIt's about 10 minutes by taxi to most hotels and served by many bus lines.\nThe bus line 212 direction Aeroporto / B.Mar x Mario Cyprestes takes you from the airport via the Camburi beach, the port and the city center to the main bus station in 50-60 minutes.\n\n\nBy bus\nVit\u00f3ria's long-distance bus station is downtown, also with many bus lines serving it. There are many buses arriving and leaving during the day from cities like Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Bras\u00edlia and others. It's around 20 minutes away from most of the hotels by taxi and 30 to 35 minutes by bus.\nThe bus 212 Aeroporto / B.Mar x Mario Cyprestes  takes you from the bus station via the city center, the port and the Camburi beach to the airport in 50-60 minutes.\nThe bus trip from Rio de Janeiro takes about 8 hours, and from S\u00e3o Paulo some 14 hours, but most of the bus times are at night, making the trip not as tiring and time-wasting.\n\n\nBy train\nThe train station is located in the city of Cariacica (Greater Vit\u00f3ria) and connects the city to Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\n\nBy car\n\nThe two main roads are the BR-101, which runs south-north just inland of the coast, linking Vit\u00f3ria to Rio de Janeiro, to the south, and Salvador, to the north, and BR-262, that runs east-west, leaving Vit\u00f3ria and going to Belo Horizonte. Another road, local highway 60, runs along the coast southward to Guarapari.\n\n\nGet around\nVitoria has an extensive bus network. You cannot pay cash in the bus, instead you need a local \"Cart\u00e3o GV - Bilhete \u00danico Metropolitano\". If you've a CPF you might be able to get one in a pharmacy. Otherwise, without a CPF, you can get one at the Terminal Jardim Am\u00e9rica, opposite the train station.\n\n\nSee\n\nParts of the old town look a bit grubby and like they're dissolving away in the salt air, but 5 centuries is a long time.\n\n1 Catedral Metropolitana, Pra\u00e7a Dom Fernando Scortegagna - Centro. Vit\u00f3ria's cathedral, dates from 1551. Located downtown. \n2 Capela de Santa Luzia, \u260f +55 27 3222-3219. M-F 08:00-18:00. Near the cathedral, is Vit\u00f3ria's oldest religious building. \n3 Pal\u00e1cio Anchieta, Pra\u00e7a Jo\u00e3o Cl\u00edmaco, 142, \u260f +55 27 3636 1032. Colonial palace also from 16th century that now serves as a government building. Tours available and usually there are showcases of an art exhibit. A Jesuit priest is also buried on the grounds. (updated Nov 2020)\n4 Igreja de S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, R. Cosme Rolim, 56. This is another notable church that used to be the city's metropolitan cathedral. (updated Nov 2020)\n5 Parque Moscoso, Av. Cleto Nunes. Tu-Su 05:00-22:00, closed M. If you need a break, this park is nice and shady, but, it seems its golden years are a little past and probably isn't a must. In the northeast corner you'll find a physical science museum called the Escola da Ci\u00eancia-F\u00edsica with exhibits on topics like mechanics and optics, but it's kind of geared towards adolescents. (updated Nov 2020)\n6 Parque Bot\u00e2nico Vale, Av. dos Expedicion\u00e1rios, s/n - Jardim Camburi (on far north side of city). Tu-Su 08\u02d000-17\u02d000, closed M. Botanical garden. (updated Nov 2020)\n7 Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Pra\u00e7a Irm\u00e3 Jos\u00e9fa Hosana, 5, \u260f +55 27 3223 1287. Carmelite (as opposed to Jesuit or Franciscan, who were already established) mission/convent built around 1682 with an original Baroque design that subsequently gave way to neo-gothic architecture after a 20th century renovation. (updated Nov 2020)\n8 Convento de S\u00e3o Francisco, R. Uruguai, 47, \u260f +55 27 3323 6711. This one was an undertaking of the Franciscan order at the end of the 16th century, considered the oldest in southern Brazil, and dedicated to St. Francis. (updated Nov 2020)\n9 Pra\u00e7a Costa Pereira. It's not really safe to hang out here, but driving around this square you can see the aesthetically pleasing Carlos Gomes (performing arts) Theater which was modeled after the Scala Theater in Milan, Italy to the north and the almost equally impressive SESC Cultural Center Glory to the south along Av Jeronimo Monteiro. Or catch a performance at one of these for greater appreciation. (updated Nov 2020)\n10 Santu\u00e1rio Bas\u00edlica de Santo Ant\u00f4nio, R. Ludov\u00edco Pavone, \u260f +55 27 3332 0373. This basilica, kind of like a megastructure amongst the squalor, is a relatively recent addition, being constructed only in the 20th century, but the fact that you can access a viewpoint of surrounding Vitoria from the roof is quite a draw, in addition to the grandeur of the structure itself. (updated Nov 2020)\n11 Pier de Lemanj\u00e1. Scenic ocean view but not very safe or clean, unfortunately. (updated Nov 2020)\n12 Parque Pedra da Cebola (Onion Rock Park). Located in the Jardim da Penha neighborhood near the university, the centerpiece of this park is an unusual rock formation. A popular place for local couples to hang out. (updated Nov 2020)\n . (updated Nov 2020)\n13 Convento da Penha (across the Terceira Ponte (Third Bridge) in Vila Velha). Distinctive hilltop Franciscan convent dating from the 16th century (it's kind of like the premier area attraction). (updated Nov 2020)\n14 Espa\u00e7o Baleia Jubarte, Pra\u00e7a do Papa - Enseada do Su\u00e1, \u260f +55 27 98825 0440. Tu-Su 12\u02d000-16\u02d000, closed M. A marine biology exhibit space focused on humpback whales that come to reproduce off the Capixaba coast from June to November. Marine biologists provide talks and during the whale season, boat tours are even available for R$300. (updated Nov 2020)\n15 TAMAR Project, Av. Nossa Sra. dos Navegantes, 700A (also on Pra\u00e7a do Papa, on point sticking out into bay), \u260f +55 27 3225 3787. Th F 13\u02d000-17\u02d000, Sa Su 11\u02d000-17\u02d000.

Just a few steps to the east along Rua Pedro Palacios, on the south side you will find the Escadaria Maria Ortiz, an elaborate staircase, where locals repelled a Dutch attack in times past. But, lo, it is not safe to come here in the before or after business hours of the day. (updated Nov 2020)\n19 Monjardim Manor House, Av. Paulino Muller, \u260f +55 27 3223 6609. A living museum that once was the Monjardim family ranch, belonging to a prosperous family with strong ties to Portuguese royalty. It portrays historical aspects of Vitoria. (updated Nov 2020)\n20 Museu do Pescador, R. Felicidade Corr\u00eaa dos Santos, \u260f +55 27 3132 8372. M-F 13:00-17:00, Sa 12:00-16:00, Su 13:00-16:00. Just a small gallery dedicated to the story of the fisherman, but, if you're here you can also enjoy a number of restaurants along the same street as well as watching ship traffic and the affairs of the day pass along the back bay from the Pra\u00e7a Dom Jo\u00e3o Batista. (updated Nov 2020)\n\n\nDo\n1 Parque da Fonte Grande (from the neighborhood of Praia do Canto, take the direction of Maru\u00edpe and make a right turn on the Police Station Headquarters, towards Serafim Derenzi Road; from there, keep going straight ahead until you see the sign to get in the park; the route should take 15 minutes by car). Tu-Su 08:00-17:00. Located in the central portion of the island, this is the biggest park of Vit\u00f3ria, preserving an important remaining area of the Atlantic Forest. Visitors can choose from many planned walks inside the forest and spot native animals such as snakes, small mammals, and many species of birds. The area's highlight is its 309m high mountain from which you can appreciate beautiful views from Vit\u00f3ria and nearby cities. (updated Nov 2020)\n2 Pra\u00e7a dos Namorados. One of the more popular beachside parks that runs from the yacht club at Praia do Canto all the way down to Curva da Jurema near Shopping Vit\u00f3ria. (updated Nov 2020)\n3 Praia Curva da Jurema. Little kiosks here to satisfy your post-swim/sun tan hunger pangs. (updated Nov 2020)\n4 Praia de Camburi. A long beach bordered by restaurants, hotels, and a boardwalk. But it can be rather dirty, not just the grounds and facilities, but also the water from sewage/mining runoff. (updated Nov 2020)\n\n\nLearn\nAt UFES (Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo), one can find Portuguese courses for foreigners at its Language Center. There are beginning and intermediate courses, and each level takes 1 semester.\n\n\nBuy\n1 Association of Potters of Goiabeiras, R. das Paneleiras, 55, \u260f +55 27 3327 0519. M-Sa 08:00-18:00, Su 09:00-15:00. This is almost more like an attraction because you can watch pottery being made here by a guild of artisans. But there are also ceramics for sale such as a panela de barro, a traditionally-made clay pot used for cooking moqueca capixaba. (updated Nov 2020)\n2 Shopping Vit\u00f3ria. A fairly standard shopping mall near the Terceira Ponte. Around Christmas you can see all the Nordic adornments like Christmas trees and Santa even though it's probably 27 degrees outside. (updated Nov 2020)\n\n\nEat\nJust south of Camburi is the Praia do Canto neighborhood, where you will find a couple of streets lined with restaurants of all types.\n\n\nMid-range\n1 Salsa Pizzaria, R.

(updated Nov 2020)\n Rua da Lama, \u260f +55 27 3225-0417. Just west of Camburi near the federal university, has a string of bars including Cochicho da Penha. \nOn most nights, there are live music events on the beach at Curva da Jurema. Music varies and there are plenty of drink kiosks to keep people happy.\nWunderbar Kaffee.
