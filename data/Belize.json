  "extract": "Belize offers world-class attractions include exploring the lush jungles with exotic plants and animals, deep sea fishing, swimming, snorkelling and diving in the Caribbean Sea with its attractive reefs and visiting the Mayan ruins. While income levels are still very low and the infrastructure is very basic, Belizeans are very proud and friendly to visitors as the tourist industry grew greatly in the last decade. It is the only country in mainland Central America with English as its official language. \n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n1 Belmopan - inland capital\n2 Belize City - Belize's largest city, on the Caribbean Sea\n3 Corozal Town\n4 Crooked Tree\n5 Dangriga - Large Garifuna town in the south, formerly known as Stann Creek Town\n6 Hopkins - Garifuna village\n7 Orange Walk Town\n8 Punta Gorda - Beautiful, quiet port town in the South; home to a complex and diverse Amerindian market on the weekends\n9 San Ignacio - Known as Cayo to locals, Maya and Hispanic influence near the Guatemala border\n\n\nOther destinations\n\n1 Ambergris Caye\u2013- large barrier island in the north\n2 Caye Caulker \u2013 smaller barrier island in the north\n3 Placencia Peninsula \u2013 long peninsula (almost an island) off Stann Creek\n4 Tobacco Caye \u2013 a tiny island popular with budget travellers\n\n\nMaya ruins\n5 Altun Ha\n6 Caracol\n7 Lamanai\n8 Lubaantun\n9 Xunantunich\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nBelize, formerly British Honduras, is the only country in Central America without a coastline on the Pacific Ocean (only the Caribbean Sea to its east). With its British colonial history and a long Caribbean coast, it's culturally similar to many of Britain's former West Indian island colonies, with a majority creole or Afro-Caribbean population. But it also includes a large native Mayan population, especially in the north and northwest of the country. As a result, although English is the official language, Spanish is also often spoken. In the south east along the Caribbean coast live the Garifuna (Black Caribs), an Afro-Amerindian culture.\nAfter long journeys starting in what is now the Netherlands in 1790, via Germany, Southern Russia, Canada, the United States, and Mexico, several thousand German-speaking Mennonite Christians arrived in Belize in 1958 after long and detailed discussions with the government regarding specific exemptions and privileges. They are easily recognizable by their speech (somewhat distinctive from modern standard German) and \"quaint\" dress.\n\n\nHistory\n\nLike the neighbouring parts of Guatemala and Mexico, this area was settled for thousands of years by the Maya people. They are still here, an important part of Belize's people and culture. While the Spanish Empire claimed the area in the 16th century, the Spanish made little progress in settling here. The British settled first on the coast and offshore islands for logging. In 1798 British Belizean forces defeated a Spanish attempt to drive them out in the Battle of St. George's Caye, an anniversary still celebrated as a holiday each 10 September.\nThe colony of British Honduras grew in the 19th century. At first Africans were brought in as slaves, but slavery was abolished here in 1838. Following the abolition of slavery, the British would bring indentured Indian labourers to the colony to supplement the labour pool, and their descendants remain a significant minority to this day. Many refugees from the 19th-century Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula escaped the conflict to settle in Belize, especially the northern section.\nThe government of Guatemala has long claimed to have inherited the 15th-century Spanish claim to Belize. Although the British were willing to grant independence to British Honduras as early as the mid-1960s, this ongoing dispute played a major role in delaying full Belizean independence until 1981, long after London granted independence to other former colonies in the region. Guatemala refused to recognize an independent Belize at all until 1991, and to this day lays claim to virtually all Belizean territory south of Belize City. The topic remains a sensitive one, particularly in the southern half of Belize.\nBelize escaped the bloody civil conflicts of the 1980s that engulfed much of Central America, and refugees from the conflict in Guatemala arrived, mostly settling in the west. While Belize has not been immune to the rampant drug crime and grinding poverty of its neighbours, it is a comparatively safe destination in a conflict-prone part of the world. Belize shares particularly close diplomatic and economic ties with both the United Kingdom and the United States.\nTourism has become the mainstay of the economy as the old agricultural products \u2014 sugar, banana, and oranges \u2014 have lost ground. The country remains plagued by high unemployment, growing involvement in the South American drug trade, and increased urban crime. In 2006, commercial quantities of oil were discovered in the Spanish Lookout area.\n\n\nClimate\nTropical, very hot and humid. The dry season typically lasts from February to May and then the rainy season typically lasts through to November. Hurricanes that bring coastal flooding, especially in the south, are prevalent from June to November.\n\n\nTerrain\nThe flat coastal plain is swampy with low mountains in the south. The highest point is Victoria Peak at 1,160 m.\n\n\nVisitor information\nTravel Belize website.\n\n\nTalk\nAs a former British colony, the official language of Belize is standard British English, which makes Belize stand out from its Spanish-speaking neighbours.\nSpanish, Garifuna (Carib) and the Maya languages/dialects of Kekchi, Mopan and Yucatec are spoken in various parts of the country. Spanish is widely used as the first language in northern and western parts of the country. So-called \"kitchen Spanish,\" an amalgam of Spanish and English, is common on Ambergris Caye. Belizean Creole, which has a certain degree of mutual intelligibility with standard English, is widely spoken as well. Most Belizeans are proficient in English and at least one of these other languages.\nMany Belizeans speak a mix of Creole and English among friends, and standard English to foreigners. The strong Caribbean accent may take some getting used to.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nEntry requirements\nAll visitors are required to have sufficient funds, US$75 per day, and documents required for their next destination.\nIf entering by land from Mexico, you will be charged a fee of M$533 (Mexican pesos) (as of May 2018) by Mexican immigration unless you can show proof that you paid the immigration fee when you entered Mexico. Your FMM tourist card is not enough. If you crossed at a land border, you'll need the actual receipt from when you paid the fee. If you reached Mexico via a commercial flight, you've may have already paid the fee with your airfare, but the border guards here do not care. You might be able to convince them if you have a print-out of an itemized receipt from the airline showing that this specific fee was included.\n\n\nVisa-free\nNationals who hold passports or refugee documents from all European Union member states, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, El Salvador, Eswatini, Fiji, the Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Monaco, Namibia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Suriname, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, Uganda, United States, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Vatican City, Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe, in addition to passports issued to British Overseas Territories citizens, do not require a visa to visit Belize.\nAll foreign nationals with a valid US green card or visa for the US or Schengen Area are visa exempt for a maximum stay of 90 days.\nPermanent residents and holders of multiple entry visas of the United States may obtain a visa on arrival for a fee of US$50.\n\n\nVisas\nAll other travellers not falling into the above categories require a visa prior to travel, which can be obtained in a Belizean or British embassy.\nNationals of Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Haiti, India, Iran, Iraq, Kenya, North Korea, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Thailand require clearance in addition to a visa.\nNationals of China (PRC) must pay a repatriation fee of BZ$3,000 on arrival. Nationals of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka must pay a repatriation fee of BZ$1,200 on arrival.\nCruise ship visitors do not need a passport to enter the country.\nWhen leaving country by land, prepare to pay taxes (mandatory BZ$40 or US$20 border fee per person (as of 2022). Overstayers will receive a substantial fine.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport (BZE IATA) (in Ladyville, 15 km northwest of Belize City (roughly 30 minutes' drive)). Year round flights are available from the USA (American, Delta, Southwest and United); Central America (Transportes A\u00e9reos Guatemaltecos (TAG) Guatemala city and Copa Airlines Panama); from within Belize and from the adjacent Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico (Maya Island Air and Tropic Air). Additional seasonal flights (Oct-Mar) are offered from Canada with Air Canada Rouge and Westjet.   \nFor a cheaper fare, consider flying to Cancun or M\u00e9rida and take a bus to Belize city from there.\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Mexico via Chetumal, or on a much rougher road from Guatemala via Melchor de Mencos.  The Western Highway connects Melchor Mencos to Belize City via Belmopan, San Ignacio while the Philip Goldson Highway (Northern Highway) connects Belize City to Chetumal in Mexico via Corozal Town and Orange Walk.\n\n\nBy bus\nThe following companies operate buses from Flores, Guatemala, and from Chetumal, Mexico to Belize City:\n\n Fuentes Del Norte (FDN), Mundo Maya @ Suite #26, Brown Sugar Market Place 90 Front St, Belize City (250 m east along Front St from the Swing Bridge & the Ocean Ferry Belize Terminal.), \u260f +501 223-1200. Tickets are sold through Mundo Maya Travel at the San Pedro Express Terminal in Belize City. Buses stop at the marketplace along Front Street where the San Pedro Express Terminal is at. (updated Sep 2017)\n S & L Travel & Tours, 91 N Front St, Belize City (same building as Image Factory, next to Spoonaz Coffee), \u260f +501 227-7593. They arrange shuttle transportation to Tikal, Flores and Cancun from Belize City. (updated Sep 2017)\n Grupo ADO, Novelos Bus Terminal in Belize City. Once nightly departure to/from Cancun and Merida. (updated Sep 2017)\n BBOC. Frequent (hourly?) from Chetumal to Belize City and vice versa, with stops at Corozal, Orange Walk, and other towns along the way. Buses leave Chetumal from the \"old ADO station\" (la terminal antigua de ADO) on Salvador Novo street near Av. Insurgentes and Av. Belice. (updated May 2018)\nThe inbound buses can only make drop-off stops between the border crossing and Belize City while the outbound buses can only pick-up passengers going traveling to Mexico or Guatemala. There are additional Belizean bus companies and drivers' unions going north from Belize City to Chetumal that can pick-up and drop off passengers alongside the road with services to Orange Walk and Corozal Town. See \"By bus\" under get around in the below.\n\n\nBy boat\nSeveral cruise lines call on Belize City. Unfortunately they usually stay only one day, which doesn't allow the opportunity to really see Belize.  You can visit one of the Maya ruins, ride an airboat in the salt marshes just outside the city, shop, go to the museum, go to the zoo or take either a short cave rafting trip or go snorkelling, but that's about it.  That means about 70% of the things most tourists would like aren't available, not mention the eco-tourism points of interest.\nTo Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Honduras, the Gulf Cruza, a small, rickety speed boat (20 people) leaves Placencia each Friday at around 9:30AM (4 hr US$50), going first to Big Creek. It returns to Placencia on Monday.  Tickets are sold in the tourist office next to the gas station. Stop by immigration first.\nSmall speedboats operate on a daily basis between Puerto Barrios in Guatemala to Punta Gorda, cost is around US$20 one way. On Tuesday and Fridays, boats operate from Livingston in Guatemala to Punta Gorda. The ride takes no more than one hour. It's BZ$50.\nThere's also a BZ$40 departure tax. Foreigners are required to pay departure taxes when leaving Belize via land, air, or water. These fees are only applicable to locals when flying.\n\n\nGet around\n\nBelize is a fairly small country, and transportation between most destinations is rarely long or tedious.\n\n\nBy plane\nTropic Air and Maya Island Air both have multiple flights daily to various towns around the country and to Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker. They fly out of both of Belize City's airports, but flights from Belize City Airport (TZA IATA) are often significantly cheaper than those out of Phillip Goldson International (BZE IATA). Domestic flights are generally pretty reasonable priced, and thus popular if your time is limited and budget is not. Flights are operated with planes ranging from 8 to 68 seats. Because of the limited capacity, booking in advance is advisable. For bookings from outside Belize, there is only one airviva internet agent, who can make bookings, take payment (credit/debit cards/PayPal) and then send e-tickets. Some hotels do also offer to make the flight reservation on your behalf.\n\n\nBy bus\nSeveral competing bus lines operate on the main road in the north\u2013south direction from Punta Gorda to Belmopan and Belize City. There are bus stations in the main towns, or simply stand on the side of the highway and wave at an approaching bus. Most buses have a conductor in addition to the driver, who stands by the door and will come to your seat to collect the fare at some point during the trip. Fares run anywhere from BZ$2\u201325 depending on distance travelled.\nExpress buses can save up to an hour and a half (depending on the distance of your trip); they do not stop for passengers waiting on the roadside, making only scheduled pick-ups and drop-offs in towns.\nMost buses in Belize are retired US school buses (Bluebirds), that have been given a slight makeover, a luggage rack installed, and sometimes a new paint job. They generally aren't too crowded, but you may have to stand occasionally. Some are the older MCI (Motorcoach Industries) buses that once served as a Greyhound bus (or for some other commuter or intercity bus company) in the U.S. The MCI buses are typically used for some Express services or for international trips to Chetumal or chartered buses to Flores.\nChildren selling snacks and soft drinks often board the buses at stops, and this is an inexpensive way to have a snack if you've exhausted what you've brought along or just want to try some home-made travel foods.\nSee Belize Bus blog for updates, schedules and/or links to other sites regarding bus travel in Belize. The Belize Bus blog site is constantly updated. Since the break up of the Novelo's monopoly in 2006 the government of Belize has divided the country up with which company to go where from Belize City:\n\nThe Northern Zone (Belize City - Orange Walk - Corozal - Chetumal)  Not all buses continue to Chetumal from Orange Walk. Others may deviate east or west from the Philip Goldson Highway (Northern Highway) to other surrounding towns. They are: Albion's, Belize Bus Owners Cooperative (BBOC), Cabrera's, Chell's, Frazer, Joshua's, Morales, Tillett's, T-Line and Valencia. Northbound buses depart from Belize City about every half hour from 05:30 to 19:30. Jex and Sons Bus provides bus service between Belize City and Crooked Tree.\nThe Western Zone (Belize City - Belmopan - San Ignacio - Benque Viejo Del Carmen) They are: BBOC, D and E, Guerra's Bus Service, Middleton's, Shaw Bus Service and Westline. Westbound buses depart from Belize City between 05:00 and 21:00. Some may continue west from San Ignacio to the Guatemalan border at Melchor del Mencos but they do not cross into Guatemala. Others may continue north or south from Belmopan, San Ignacio, etc. to reach other towns not on the Western Highway.\nSouthern Zone (Belize City - Belmopan - Dangriga - Placencia - Punta Gorda) Buses to the Cayo and Stann Creek Districts to the south are: James Bus Line, G-Line Service, Ritchie's Bus Service and Usher Bus Line. Buses authorized to operate in the rural areas of the Southern Zone are Chen Bus Line, Yascal Bus Line, Smith Bus Line, Richie Bus Line, Martinez Bus Line, Williams Bus Line, Radiance Ritchie Bus Line, and Polanco Bus Line.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxis are common and relatively cheap in Belize. Most taxis do not use meters, so be sure to negotiate the price beforehand.\n\n\nBy water taxi\n\nFor those wanting a truly Belizean experience, take the water taxis from city to city.  The San Pedro Belize Express has the most daily runs and departs from the Brown Sugar Terminal in Belize City at 09:00, 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 15:00, 16:00 and 17:30 to San Pedro and Caye Caulker.\nDeparture from San Pedro Town pier on Black Coral Street next to Wahoo's Bar and Grill and leaves at 07:00, 08:30, 10:00, 11:30, 12:30, 14:30, 16:30 to Caye Caulker and Belize City as well as a last boat to Caye Caulker only at 18:00.\nThere are boats departing from Caye Caulker to Belize City and San Pedro Town and they leave from the pier in front of the Basket Ball Court. Caye Caulker to Belize City: 07:30, 09:00, 10:30, 12:00, 13:00, 15:00, 17:00 and Caye Caulker to San Pedro: 07:00 (connection to Chetumal), 09:45, 11:45, 12:45, 13:45, 15:45, 16:45 and last boat 18:15.\nChetumal Runs are available from Caye Caulker at 07:00 and from San Pedro at 07:30.\nTravelling from Chetumal to Belize, the boat leaves the Municipal Pier at 15:30 en route to San Pedro (90 min) and Caye Caulker (120 min).\nRates: Belize City to San Pedro or return: BZ$30 or US$15 (one way), BZ$55 or US$27.50 (round trip).\nCaye Caulker to San Pedro, Belize City to Caye Caulker: BZ$20 or US$10 (one way), BZ$35 or US$17.50 (round trip).\n\n\nBy car\nCompared to most Central American countries, driving in Belize is relatively safe. There is not much traffic, and the four major highways are all in good condition. Unfortunately, almost every road off the four major highways is unpaved so a 4-wheel drive vehicle is advisable. It is best not to drive late at night because there is almost no lighting, road signs are poor, and the last stretch is almost certain to be on an unpaved road (you risk breaking an axle on an unseen, but immense, pothole!) You won't need a map because there are few roads and it is hard to get lost.\nRental rates often include insurance so you usually don't need to buy insurance separately. If you plan on using a rental car to visit Tikal in Guatemala, you should plan ahead and you must rent from Crystal Auto Rental because no other company will let you take your car out of Belize. Belize insurance is not valid in Guatemala so check with your credit card or car insurance company to see if they'll cover you for a trip into Guatemala.\n\n\nHighways\nThe Northern Highway (aka Phillip Goldson Highway) goes from Corozal on the Belize-Mexico border to Belize City via Orange Walk. This is the highway you'll use for the international airport, Altun Ha, and the Lamanai.\nWestern Highway (aka George Price Highway) stretches from Belize City, via Belmopan and the Cayo District, to the border with the Guatemalan state of Peten at Benque. Along the way are the Belize Zoo (mile 29), the Hummingbird Highway (mile 47), Belmopan, and San Ignacio (mile 68). Major sights along this route include the adventure itineraries in the Cayo District, Mayan ruins at Xunantunich and access to the road to Caracol, and, from the Guatemalan border, the ruins at TIkal. To get to the Western Highway from the airport, go north on the Northern Highway, make a left at Burrell Boom, and follow the road for 19 km to the Western Highway at Hattieville.\nHummingbird Highway goes from Belmopan to Dangriga connecting the Western Highway to the Southern Highway. You'll use this highway to get from Cayo, Belize City or the North to the Southern part of Belize. An alternative, slightly shorter, Coastal Highway takes you from Belize City to the Southern Highway but is a mess that is best avoided!\nSouthern Highway runs from Dangriga (the Hummingbird Highway) to Punta Gorda, with a section heading to the southern border with Guatemala. Along the way are the coastal towns of Hopkins and Placencia.\n\n\nSee\n\nThe world heritage listed Belize Barrier Reef stretching along the whole coast of Belize.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nZip-lining\nSoar over Belize's rain forest by taking a zip-line tour. These tours usually begin with a short hike up to the first base where a tutorial is given on how to safely use your equipment.\n\nPrices range US$65-100 and tours are run by two companies, Jaguar Paw, and Back-A-Bush tours.\n\n\nSport fishing\nSport fishing in Belize is second to none. The bonefish is the premier fly fishing game fish in the world and it can be found in the grass shallows through Belize.  It's pound for pound perhaps the strongest animal in salt water.\n\n\nScuba diving and snorkelling\n\nThe snorkelling and scuba diving is world-class and there are many exceptional dive sites to be found in Belize. One of the best ways to explore Belize waters is by chartering a yacht to make the most of your available dive time.\nFor those with a smaller budget, snorkelling and driving excursions can be found along the beaches of Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker. The most common excursions will take you to Hol Chan marine reserve and to Shark Ray Alley. These trips usually cost about US$35 and include snorkel gear. Be mindful of an additional BZ$10 charged to foreigners as a park tax. This money goes toward the upkeep, and protection of the reef. Diving excursions are also offered to the Blue Hole, but expect to pay a lot more for the privilege.\n\n\nCave exploration\nThe Cayo district is characterised by limestone hills underlain by a network of underground rivers, caves and sink holes. The caves are magnificent, with huge caverns and tight passages, underground waterfalls and dazzling arrays of mineral-encrusted stalactites and stalagmites. This underground world was sacred to the ancient Maya and many artefacts from decorated pots to human remains are still intact in the caves. It is dangerous (and illegal) to enter the caves without a licensed guide. Most guides are trained in the geology and mythology of the caves and in modern first aid and cave rescue techniques.\n\n Ian Anderson's Caves Branch Adventure Company and Jungle Lodge, Caves Branch (Hummingbird Highway south from Belmopan). Anderson organized the initial guiding training programs in the country, out of which grew the Belize Disaster And Rescue Response Team locally called BDARRT (now an independent NGO). \nThe Sleeping Giant and Caves Branch are operated by the same owner. They operate up to 16 tours every day. The Actun Tunichil Muknal or ATM caves have the highest number of tourists visiting a tourist destination in Central America. Also known as the Cave of the Crystal Sepulchre, this river cave has pristine remnants of some Mayan human sacrifices. It is a surreal experience complete with beautiful cave formations an underground river and Mayan collectibles. No wonder the Mayans called it the Xibalba or the dark underworld.\n\n\nBuy\n\nThe currency of Belize is the dollar (ISO code BZD), divided into 100 cents.\nThe Belizean dollar \u2014 sometimes written as \"BZ$\" or just as a dollar sign: \"$\" \u2014 has been fixed to the US dollar (USD) at a 2:1 ratio since 1978 (i.e. BZ$2 = US$1).\nBecause of this consistent exchange rate, US dollars are widely accepted, but you should be careful to clarify which \"dollars\" you're talking about when negotiating prices. It's often better to assume Belize dollars because many merchants will jump on your uncertainty and attempt to double their price by saying, \"No, in US dollars\". Change can also be given in US dollars or a combination of US and Belizean dollar bills and coins.  Belize dollars come in denominations of BZ$2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. Coins in Belize are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents and B$1. The 25-cents coin is often called a shilling.\n\nThree banks' ATMs in Belize accept Mastercard: the Belize Bank, Scotiabank, and Atlantic Bank.\nAtlantic Bank offers free cash withdrawals with Visa. Source: #Nomadic Backpacker\n\n\nEat\n\nThe primary meal found virtually everywhere is red beans, clean rice, and chicken.\nMost chicken in the country is prepared and served on the bone.\nRice and beans is a mixed dish with some spices and usually coconut milk added to make a sweet and hot staple of the Belizean diet. Beans and rice is white cooked rice with a side of stewed pinto beans.\nCitrus plantations are numerous, so fresh oranges and grapefruit are abundant. Pineapples, papayas, bananas and plantains are also grown and sold in roadside markets.\nA famous hot sauce in Belize is Marie Sharp's made from the very spicy local habanero pepper. It comes in a variety of flavours (mild, hot, extremely hot).\nThat odd looking salsa on your table is really ceviche. Ceviche -also spelled as cebiche or seviche- is a citrus-marinated seafood dish. The Belizeans use fresh raw conch and vegetables.\nPapusas are maize pancakes with different toppings sold in stalls on the streets in San Pedro town. It is the cheapest option if you want to eat on a budget.\nEating in San Pedro can be expensive if you eat at the tourist restaurants; however if you find the local places, meals can be very inexpensive and very tasty.\n\n\nDrink\nBelikin is the national beer and comes in four varieties: Premium, Beer, Stout, and Lighthouse Lager. Guinness Stout is also available in Belize but it's also brewed by the Belikin Brewing Co. All are sold in returnable bottles, so make sure you are aware of the deposit if you are taking your beverages to go.\nOne Barrel Rum is the locally distilled molasses-tasting rum and Traveller's Liquors' distillery is on the Northern Highway about 6 miles from Belize City with a gift shop and hospitality bar. You can purchase rum in a variety of colours and sizes, up to a 70-gallon cask.\nBoth are widely available around the country. But if you also like wine there is cashew wine (which is very popular in Belize), ginger wine, sorrel wine and blackberry wine.\n\n\nLearn\nThere are great opportunities for scuba diving off of Belize atolls.  Check out reefci for some very interesting 1 week adventures that are both informative conservation education as well as great scuba diving. If you want to learn about Belize's history the Museum of Belize, House of Culture, and of course, travelling and discovering are recommended.\n\n\nStay safe\nBelize City is the most dangerous area in Belize, although it's very easy to be safe there. Remain in the tourist zone that runs just north of the marina to the southern extension to the east of the main canal. There are plenty of khaki tourist police monitoring the area and, should you have a problem, feel free to approach them. Just exercise common sense and do not go wandering around alone after dark.  Stay near tourist areas or other commercial zones. The south side of Belize City is beautiful as well as dangerous. Otherwise, Belize City is a great place to go if you want to eat, learn, or shop.\nOther areas of Belize are generally safe, but like any other place in the world, one should always have some skepticism when dealing with strangers. Most are genuinely helpful, but it never hurts to be cautious.\nBy law, the government can deny LGBT travellers entry to Belize. There are also no legal protections in place for victims of anti-gay discrimination.\n\n\nStay healthy\nBelize is a relatively healthy country. Bottled water is a must in most areas. And, unless you eat only at ultra-touristic restaurants, travellers' diarrhea will probably strike at some point; be prepared with over-the-counter medication and prescription antibiotics.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control list all of Belize except Belize City as a malaria risk area, and recommends the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Dengue fever is also a risk in Belize. Other drugs may also be recommended in certain circumstances - consult a qualified professional specialist.\nInsect/mosquito bites should be prevented with appropriate clothing, repellents and insecticides, and bed nets if sleeping in non-air-con/unscreened rooms.\nThe sun, as anywhere else in the tropics, is very intense. Wear a long-sleeve shirt, a hat, and sunglasses, and apply high-SPF sunscreen regularly. If you are spending significant time on boats or in water, such as fishing or snorkeling, take extra precautions: covered shoes (not sandals), swim shirt/rash guard, neck gaiter, and sun gloves.\nMany places in Belize are very hot and humid, and dehydration is a risk. An expat suggests to drink as much water as you want, and then drink that much again.\nThe adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is 2.5% or one in every forty adults, this is notably higher than in most of Europe or Anglo-America and also quite a bit higher than in other parts of Central America like Nicaragua or Costa Rica.\n\n\nRespect\nBelizeans are some of the most socially relaxed people in the world, especially if you venture inland away from the tourist islands of Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker. The pace of life is generally slower in Belize, so it's good practice to begin any social interaction, even to ask a quick question, with eye contact and a genuinely pleasant greeting. Most rural Belizeans enjoy casual conversation and you could easily find yourself chatting for a few hours.\nThe Maya communities can be a little more reserved at times. As always, a little respect and politeness will carry you through.\n\n\nConnect\nPayphones are the most common public phones and accept pre-purchased phone cards.\nInternet caf\u00e9s can be found in larger tourist areas, but are infrequent in rural areas.\nThe government used to prohibit allow Skype and forced tourists to call out of the country using the government-owned phone company. The main telephone company, Belize Telemedia Limited, has removed blocks from all voice-over-internet-protocol services. Applications such as Skype and Vonage are now able to work within the country and may be a cheaper than landline or cellular connection.",
