  "extract": "Caen is the capital of the Calvados department in northern France. With a population of 115,000, it is the largest city in Lower Normandy.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nCaen is a college city and thus very active. It is a modern city; four-fifths of it was  demolished in 1944 and rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s. However, some old buildings remain, especially churches.\nIn summer, tourists (mainly British and German) gather in Normandy for Second World War memorials and the Memorial for Peace. Caen is an excellent base for visits to the D-Day beaches.\nCaen itself and the surrounding area saw intense fighting starting shortly after the landings on June 6, 1944. The village of Carpiquet, which is a bit west of Caen near the ring road and the E46 highway, has the Caen airport so it was strategically important and also saw heavy fighting.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nFrom Paris, by A13 (toll).\nFrom Cherbourg by N13.\nFrom Rouen, by A13 or N175 (toll).\nFrom Rennes, by A84.\nFrom Tours and Le Mans, by N138, via N158, at S\u00e9es.\n\n\nBy train\nTrains leave about every 2 hr from Paris Saint-Lazare station to Caen and Cherbourg. The trip takes about 2 hr and costs \u20ac33.30. If you book early, you can get tickets as cheap as \u20ac15. Out of rush hours, tickets cost \u20ac22.40 for people under 25.\nThe train posting in Paris St-Lazare can be confusing to the first-time traveller. The train line number (\"la voie\") is not posted until 15-20 min before the departure, so do not panic if you arrive earlier than that (notice that the train will be at a line number near the office \"Grandes Lignes\"). Look for the train heading to Cherbourg. Caen will not be the listed destination, as it is a stop along the way. Do not forget to punch (\"composter\") your ticket in one of the yellow machines before boarding to validate your ticket.\nCaen's train station is a 15-20 minute walk from the centre of the city, and is served by public transport frequently.\n\n\nBy ferry\nFerries cross the Channel from Portsmouth (UK) to Ouistreham, 15 km north of Caen with buses from the ferry terminal to Caen train station.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Caen Airport (CFR  IATA), Route de Caumont, Carpiquet (near the village of Carpiquet, a few km west of the city), \u260f +33 2 31 712010, aeroport.caen@caen.cci.fr. There are flights from Lyon, Nice and Paris.   (updated Dec 2020)\n\n\nGet around\nThe bus verts will get you around Normandy easily. Within Caen and its close suburbs, use the bus and tramway network, called twisto. The tram system consist of 3 lines, two of which pass the SNCF railway station. The tourist information centre in central Caen provides timetables and excellent maps of the city's public transport network. \n\n\nSee\n\n1 Memorial for peace (M\u00e9morial de Caen), Esplanade G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Eisenhower, \u260f +33 2 31 06 06 45, contact@memorial-caen.fr. 09:00-18:00.

It is a short train ride from Caen to Bayeux. From Bayeux train station, you can catch a bus to some of the D-Day beaches but services are infrequent; if you want to see more than one of the beaches you should rent a car or join a guided tour. On the bus website there is a map of the bus route to the D-Day beaches. Bus No. 70 takes you to Omaha beach, the American cemetery, and to Pointe Du Hoc. Bus No. 74 takes you to Arromanches beach, the location of the Mulberry harbours. Buses are few and far between. Many companies offer guided tours to the battle sites from Caen or Bayeux, and the Memorial for Peace runs half-day tours of the landing beaches.\n1 Parc Festyland, Carpiquet (Near the ring road around Caen and the E46 highway which runs from Caen to Bayeux.).

Created in 1894, it attracts around 35,000 students every year. For the occasion, carnival-goers dress up and gather on the Esplanade de la Paix on Campus 1 before parading through the city's most emblematic sites. The carnival culminates in a concert organised by the national radio station NRJ.\n\n\nBuy\n1 Sunday morning market.

The official recipe, closely guarded by a guild of tripe butchers, is written in the form of a poem.\nThe Vaugueux is full of restaurants.\n\n\nBudget\n1 Le Diplomate, 28 Rue Guillaume le Conqu\u00e9rant.
