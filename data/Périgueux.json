  "extract": "P\u00e9rigueux is a city in the Dordogne department of France.\n\n\nGet in\nPerigueux is not large enough for an airport, but as with most cities in France, there is an SNCF station from which you can connect to and from the rest of Europe. However, there are no direct train connections with Paris. Therefore, a trip to or from the French capital requires a connection in Limoges. From Paris to Limoges, several direct Intercity trains leave from Paris-Austerlitz station each day. In Limoges, hourly- to two-hourly services are available to Perigueux. The total trip takes around 4 or 5 hours.\nCar travel is logical as well, especially if you want to tour the surrounding area at your leisure.\n\n\nGet around\nMost sights are reachable by foot: main attractions like the Vesunna Museum, Renaissance area, Roman arena, art museum and the Odyssey Theatre are all within a five-minute walk from each other.\nThere is a bus system that runs through the town and to the outlying areas as well, with stops scattered pretty evenly throughout the town.\nBicycles and motor scooters can be rented from several shops, including MBK near the Office of Tourism. Prices are very reasonable, with bikes running from \u20ac10 and scooters \u20ac20-30 per day.\nThere aren't many taxis floating around town to flag. Cabs generally must be called for in advance.\n\n\nSee\n\nThere are many caves in the area. Midway between Limoges and P\u00e9rigueux is Thiviers, a small market town 30 minutes train journey north of P\u00e9rigueux and claimed to be the capital of foie gras and truffles. It is also the town in which French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre spent his childhood years. The building is now used by a property agent but the square behind has been named after him. The office of tourism in Thiviers has now incorporated a museum de Foie gras in its premises displaying many items showing how foie gras is made, entrance is free.\n\n\nDo\nSwim in the swimming pools\nGo see a movie in the 1 cinema.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\nThere is a market with fresh local produce going on Wednesday and Saturday mornings.\n\n Au Bien Bon (2 locations). \n1  15 Rue des Places. (updated May 2023)\n2  2 Rue Montaigne. (updated May 2023)\n\n\nDrink\n1 Les Toqu\u00e9s, 38 Rue Pierre Semard. Many beers to discover, good humour and concerts galore! \n\n\nSleep\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nGo next",
