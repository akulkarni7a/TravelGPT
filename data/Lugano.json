  "extract": "Lugano is a lakeside city in Ticino, the Italian-speaking part of southern Switzerland, and is the largest Italian-speaking city in Switzerland, or for that matter, outside Italy. Part of a temperate micro-climate, Lugano offers palm trees, picturesque boulevards, stunning views of the lake and the Alps, and plenty of opportunity for outdoor and indoor activities. Lugano also makes a good base for visiting other cities and sites in the area. The city is a pleasant place to relax in the summertime and is only half an hour away from Lake Como.\n\n\nUnderstand\nLugano City Council website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Lugano Airport. A small international airport with flights arriving from Zurich and Geneva. Swiss International Air Lines and Etihad Regional offer discount web special prices to Lugano from many parts of Europe.   (updated Jan 2021)\nMilan Malpensa airport is 1 hour away by shuttle (see the \"By bus\" section below) or 1 hr 40 min by train (see the \"By train\" section below) and is an EasyJet hub.\n\n\nBy train\nLugano station is on the Gotthard railway, which crosses the Alps connecting the cantons of Schwyz and Uri to Cantone Ticino. It primarily serves:\n\nFFS (SBB in German, CFF in French, the national railway operator) and EC. Long distance trains to International destinations and other parts of Switzerland.\nTILO (Joint operation between FFS and Italy's Trenord) which provides regional services, primarily to Lombardy. Direct service to Milano-Malpensa airport ~1 hr 40 min.\nFLP (metre-gauge) local services\nFFS/EC Trains leave for Z\u00fcrich (3 hr), Basel (3 hr 34 min) and Milan (40 min-1 hr) as well as Geneva (via Z\u00fcrich or Locarno-Domodossola: 5 hr 30 min with one or two transfers, 6 hr 30 min via Milan with one transfer). Getting to Geneva or points west it is faster to go via Z\u00fcrich or Locarno as the trains are more frequent and faster.\n\n1 Stazione di Lugano (Lugano railway station), \u260f +41 900 300 300. (updated Aug 2015)\nThere is a direct airport service from Lugano to Milano-Malpensa provided by TILO. It is slower (1 hr 40 min) than the bus shuttles (just over an hour) but provides more regular service. Approx Fr. 23 (Swiss francs) as of 2019. Tickets are referred to as \"Transfrontaliero\" on Trenord machines and \"Internazionale\" on SBB machines.\n\n\nBy bus\nThere are three shuttle services between Lugano and Milan Malpensa Airport.  Each takes about 1 hr 10 min to get in from Malpensa:\n\nLugano Services(approx every 2 hr, 04:00\u201323:30; 1 hr 10 min; \u20ac25 one way; advance reservations on line or tickets directly on the bus)\nJetBus (approx every 1-2 hr; 06:00\u201323:10; \u20ac27 or Fr. 35 one way; can be booked at airport)\nMalpensa Express (every 2 hr; 08:35\u201323:35; \u20ac30 or Fr. 35 one way; can be booked at airport.)\nThere is also a daily bus service during summer to Tirano, Italy with train connection (Bernina Express) to St. Moritz (Switzerland).\n\n\nBy car\nDue to physical geography, Lugano has good North-South oriented links and non-existent East-West ones.\nLugano is on the A2 motorway (just \"2\" on a red background on Swiss road signs) which spans the width of the country from Basel on the French/German borders to Chiasso on the Italian.  This is part of the European Route E35 from Amsterdam, Netherlands to Rome, Italy.\nLike most Swiss roads, the condition is usually very good and speeds are good, nevertheless distance makes journey times relatively long, particularly when travelling from the north of the country. Lugano is about 3 hr from Berne or Z\u00fcrich, in optimal conditions. This route passes through the San Gottardo tunnel, which is a bit of a bottleneck on Sundays (northbound) and Friday (southbound), so budget some time for traffic jams. Jams can be up to 3 hours long during peak travel times such as Easter.\nComing from the south, you have more choices on the flat Po plain but the main route is the A9 motorway from near Milano to Chiasso (where it becomes the Swiss A2).  This motorway is fast and relatively uncongested, and the Italians have a somewhat more carefree driving style than the Swiss. Speed limits change when crossing into Switzerland.  Lugano is about 1 hr 30 min from Milano and 1 hr 10 min from Malpensa airport, in optimal conditions.  Travelling on the A9 does incur one toll near Como, around \u20ac2.20 as of 2016.\nCrossing customs is usually a pain-free exercise.  Switzerland is part of Schengen, so they're not interested in your passport (if you're obviously European) but they are not part of the EU and may be interested if you're carrying anything you need to declare; make sure you know the duty-free limits.\n\n\nGet around\n\nLugano is small enough to get around on foot, and many of the streets are pedestrian-only, but the hills above the lakefront are very steep so the bus or the funicular from the centre of town might be a better option on the way up to the train station if you have a lot of bags. Taxis can be found on the main roads. Ferries and funiculars (Br\u00e8 and San Salvatore) are great options for seeing the views.\nFor more information:\n\n2 TPL (Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi). For bus services in the city. A short-journey ticket (30 min) costs Fr. 1.90, 1-day travelcard for 1 zone \u2014 Fr. 7.20, short-journey multi-journey travelcard (6 trips) \u2014 Fr. 9.50, the later can be used by multiple people. (updated Aug 2015)\n3 Funicolare Lugano Citta - Stazione, \u260f +41 91 800 72 28. This funicular links the old centre of the town on the lake shore to the railway station higher up the hill. From 05:20 till 23:50, always, there is one every 5-10 minutes. This is not a sightseeing funicular (as the journey is only around 90 seconds and the main purpose is to provide step-free access to the town centre), however, it is quite interesting, as it passes through a hotel. Fr. 1.10. (updated Aug 2015)\n4 Funicolare Lugano Paradiso - Monte San Salvatore, Via delle Scuole 7, Lugano Paradiso, \u260f +41 91 985 28 28. 17 Jul\u201315 Aug: daily 09:00\u201323:00; 8 May\u201311 Jul & 21 Aug\u201326 Sep: F Sa 09;00\u201323:00; the rest: 09:00-17:00.

A funicular between Lugano and the top of the Monte Br\u00e8. Single: Fr. 16; Return: Fr. 25 see the end of the page linked for promotions..

They also offer a number of cruises. While much of Lake Lugano is in Switzerland, a large portion of it is in Italy, so take your passport when on a boat. (updated Aug 2015)\n\n\nTalk\nItalian is spoken in Lugano as a primary language.  English and German are widely spoken by many of the individuals that interact with tourists.\n\n\nSee\n1 Centro Storico (Old town). \n2 Palazzo Civico (Palazzo Riva), Piazza Riforma, 1.

Fr. 7.50, Fr. 6.00 discounts for families and groups.  \n\n\nDo\n\n1 Gandria (Walk, boat or bus). Gandria is an unspoiled, picturesque lakeside village at the foot of Monte Br\u00e8. Perched on the steep mountainside it is a community of narrow streets, inaccessible to cars, with a delightful surprise round every corner.   \n2 Museo Doganale Svizzero (Swiss Customs Museum) (from Gandria by boat across the lake). There is also a grotto restaurant nearby. (updated Aug 2015)\n3 Sentiero di Gandria (Gandria Trail). A path from the end of the Lugano promenade to Gandria. It is marked with panels which describe the history of olive trees in the region. That is why it is also known as Sentiero dell'olivo. \n\n\nHiking\n4 Monte Br\u00e8 (Mount Bre). There are numerous rustic trails that lead up from towns surrounding Mount Br\u00e8 to its summit and the Funicolare Monte Br\u00e8.

Via Nassa in the city centre is the main place for shopping high street brands.\n\n Foxtown, Mendrisio, Via A. Maspoli 18 (can be reached by train from the Central Station (direction Mendrisio-Chiasso)). 11:00-19:00. Huge designer outlet 20 km from Lugano. \n1 Manor, Salita M. e A. Chiattone 10, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland, \u260f +41 91 912 76 99. Department store with everything from clothing to home goods as well as some Swiss souvenirs. Grocery store in basement. (updated Jun 2016)\n\n\nEat\nIf you like Italian-style cuisine with a Swiss twist, you're not going to go hungry here. The main draw is the Grotti, but there are much smaller restaurants and caff\u00e8 where you can get excellent food. Indeed it can be quite difficult to find non-classy food here.\nIn terms of \"fast food\", the locals love their piadine, an Italian-style wrap with various fillings (usually cold cuts, cheese, and veg) and served grilled. Essentially an Italian version of a quesadilla; delicious right?  Go try one now.\nThe main problem is that the locals don't seem to have discovered spicy food and you may have a hard time finding anything that requires chili peppers. Oh well, you can't have everything.\nRegarding times, note that mealtimes are rather strictly adhered to (this is Switzerland after all), so if you come from a 24-hour city then you may be in for a surprise when you find that nowhere is serving at 1545 when you finally decide to get out and go for a meal, and your stomach may just have to grumble a bit until you get to dinnertime.\nIf you need delivery then your best bet, aside from the ristoranti themselves is probably Divoora who have a reasonably wide selection of restaurants that will deliver, but you're going to miss out on the pleasantness and vibrancy of actually dining out in Lugano.\nIf you need groceries, then the main Swiss supermarket chains are called Migros, Coop, and Denner. The ever-present Lidl and Aldi are also here and usually significantly cheaper than the Swiss ones. On Sundays, you're kind of screwed but the Picobello in Stazione FFS (which is also a good option for out-of-hours shopping as it opens fairly late), or perhaps a Migrolino (chain of shops attached to petrol stations) ought to tide you over. You could also cross the border but remember the import limits.\n\n\nBudget\nAll these are in the city centre:\n\n1 Manora, Piazza Dante 2. The cafeteria in the Manor Department store offers a wide variety of tempting International dishes, ranging from sushi to pasta. Fresh fruits and vegetables arrayed in stylish displays are almost a painting themselves.  Wine and beer are available as are a wide range of other beverages. Meals starting from CHF12 (Oct 2017).

(updated Feb 2023)\n13 Ristorante Orologio Lugano, Via Giovanni Nizzola 2. (updated Feb 2023)\n14 Ristorante Seven Lugano the restaurant, Via Stauffacher 1. (updated Feb 2023)\n\n\nDrink\nIn the summer your best bet is just to wander along the lakeside promenade and open air bar/cafes. Check local listings for clubs and shows as venues come and go with the seasons. Spring-Autumn, Bar Mojito (p.za Manzoni, directly at the lakeside)\nThere are clubs in the city (discos). Nix (under the Casin\u00f2), Privilege (near Manor, a department store), Tito's Place (quartiere Maghetti), Club One and The Cube are all located in the downtown.\nOops (via Maderno 24) and Bibliocaf\u00e8 Tra (Salita dei Frati, Piazza Molino Nuovo) are a great place to have beer in the evening. Near University [1]. Another hint:\n\n Arte, Lungolago. Amazing decor, (also an art gallery), great food and views of the Lake! \n\n\nSleep\nThere are a wide range of hotel options right in town, from atmospheric B&Bs to posh four stars to comfy and communal hostels. Be sure to book ahead in the summer, but the rest of the year it's possible to just show up and find something as long as your budget is flexible.\n\n\nBudget\n Montarina Hotel & Hostel, Via Montarina 1, \u260f +41 91 966 72 72, fax: +41 91 966 00 17, info@montarina.com.
