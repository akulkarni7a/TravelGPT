  "extract": "Clermont-Ferrand is a city in central France, the capital of the Auvergne region. Population 140,000.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nGeography\nClermont-Ferrand is famous for the chain of extinct volcanoes that ring the city, including the highest, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, some 13 km away from the city centre.\n\n\nHistory\nOne of the oldest cities of France, its first mention was by the Greek geographer Strabo, who called it Nemessos, a Gaulish word for a sacred forest. The settlement witnessed the famous Battle of Gergovia, in which the Gauls led by Vercingetorix triumphed temporarily over the Romans led ultimately by Julius Caesar. After the Roman conquest, the city was renamed Augustonemetum, a name which combined its original Gallic name with that of the Emperor Augustus. Its population was estimated at 15,000\u201330,000 inhabitants in the 2nd century CE, making it one of the largest cities of Roman Gaul.\nIn 848, the city was renamed Clairmont, after the castle Clarus Mons. Clairmont was an episcopal city ruled by its bishop, and famously the starting point of the First Crusade raised to free Jerusalem from Muslim domination. Pope Urban II preached Crusade in 1095 at the Council of Clermont. In 1120, to counteract the power of the clergy, the counts of Auvergne founded the city of Montferrand on the model of the new cities of the Midi. In 1551, Clermont became a royal city, and in 1610, the inseparable property of the Crown.\nOn 15 April 1630, the Edict of Troyes (the First Edict of Union) forcibly joined the two cities of Clermont and Montferrand. This union was confirmed in 1731 by Louis XV with the Second Edict of Union. At this time Montferrand was no more than a satellite city of Clermont, in which condition it remained until the beginning of the 20th century. Wishing to retain its independence, Montferrand made three demands for independence, in 1789, 1848, and 1863.\n\n\nContemporary city\nIn the 20th century, the construction of the Michelin factories and city gardens definitively reunited Clermont and Montferrand. Today, although the two cities are amalgamated, one may find in Clermont-Ferrand two distinct downtowns, and Montferrand retains a strong identity.\nClermont-Ferrand remains home to the famous French tire manufacturing company Michelin.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nThe best way to travel around France is by train, and Clermont-Ferrand's train station is located just on the eastern edge of centre ville on l'Avenue de l'Union Sovietique.  Trains leave every couple of hours to and from Paris throughout the day 05:00 - 20:00.  The ride takes 3\u00bd hours, and makes 4 stops along the way.\n\n\nBy bus\nClermont-Ferrand also has a bus station. The Gare Routiere is located at in the parking lot across from the Casino supermarket where Boulevard Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand splits into Boulevard Pasteur and Boulevard Charles de Gaulle, two main blocks south of Place de Jaude.  Since France doesn't have a national bus line, all routes arriving and departing from the bus terminal are international.\n\n\nBy car\nClermont-Ferrand is also at the intersection of the A71 from Orl\u00e9ans and the North, the A75 from the South and B\u00e9ziers, and the east-west A89 from Bordeaux to Lyon.  With the exception of the Millau viaduct, about 225 km south of Clermont-Ferrand, which charges a toll, the A75 is free, unlike the A71 and A89 which charge tolls.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport (CFE  IATA) (located fifteen minutes east of town). Air France flies here from both main Paris airports, and shuttles take you to the town centre.

Also you can get around by car, scooter, motorcycle or moped.\nThis tram, known as the A, starts north in Champratel and travels south through centreville, Les Cezeaux campus before ending at La Pardieu Gare.\nClermont-Ferrand also has an extensive bus network connecting the downtown to the outlying suburbs.  The stations and stops are frequent and the map is not confusing.  The buses are limited on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n\nOn foot\nLike most European cities, Clermont-Ferrand is very walkable.  Any destination or need is within a 30 minute walk.

People gather here to watch important sporting matches which are shown on giant screens, as well as to celebrate festivals. Its centerpiece is the large bronze statue of Vercingetorix, the Gallic leader, and Julius Caesar's opponent, during the Gallic Wars, 2,000 years ago. He led a stunning victory at Gergovie (6 km south of town, the ruins and archaeological digs atop the battle field plateau are also worth a visit) which was Caesar's lone defeat during this campaign. Vercingetorix is also immortalized in bronze tiles strewn about the streets along with Clermont-Ferrand's other two famous sons: Pope Urban II who launched the first crusade, and famed mathematician Blaise Pascal.
