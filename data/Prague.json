  "extract": "Prague (Czech: Praha) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. The city's historic buildings and narrow, winding streets are testament to its centuries-old role as capital of the historic region of Bohemia. Prague lies on the banks of the beautiful, meandering Vltava River that reflects the city's golden spires and 9th century castle that dominates the skyline.\nThis historic atmosphere is combined with a certain quirkiness that embraces the entire city. From the Museum of Czech Cubism to the technicolour Jubilee Synagogue; the castle to the river, Prague is a Bohemian capital in every sense.\n\n\nDistricts\nSeveral incompatible district systems dating from different historical periods are used in Prague, for various purposes \u2013 at least three schemes. Making things worse, a given district name can be used in all the systems, but with different meanings. In this guide, a simplified version of the \"old\" district system is used. Under this system, Prague is divided into ten numbered districts (Praha 1 through Praha 10). Its advantage is that it is used on street signs and house numbers throughout the city, so you can always easily determine which \"old\" district you are in. If you encounter a district number higher than 10, a different system is being used. For example, Praha 13 is part of the \"old\" Praha 5 district. \nPraha 1 is the oldest part of the city, the original 'Town of Prague', and has by far the largest number of attractions. Praha 2 also contains important historic areas. In this central area, the \"old\" district system (or any of the newer systems) is too crude to be practical, and a finer division is needed. Traditional city \"quarters\" provide such a division. Their disadvantage is that they are somewhat incompatible with the modern district systems \u2013 although \"quarters\" are smaller than the \"old\" system districts, a single quarter can belong to two or even more districts. The advantage is that these central quarters are well known and widely used and identical to the homonymous cadastral areas shown on the street and house number signs along with the \"old\" district designation, allowing easy orientation.\n\n \n \n\nBuildings in bigger cities in the Czech Republic are marked with two numbers, one blue and one red. The blue ones are the orientation numbers \u2013 it is the ordinal number of the building on its street. Historically these numbers always started from the end of the street which is closer to a river. The red numbers are related to the house register of the entire district (for example, Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto), and thus usually correspond to the order in which the buildings in that district were constructed. Most people do not remember them; if somebody refers to \"Dlouh\u00e1 street, number 8\", they will usually mean the blue number. Red numbers usually have 3 or more digits.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThis city of bridges, cathedrals, gold-tipped towers and church domes, has mirrored on the surface of the swan-filled Vltava river for more than ten centuries. Almost undamaged by World War II, Prague's compact medieval centre remains a wonderful mixture of cobbled lanes, walled courtyards, cathedrals and countless church spires all in the shadow of her majestic 9th century castle that looks eastward as the sun sets behind her. Prague is also a modern and vibrant city full of energy, music, cultural art, fine dining and special events catering to the independent traveller's thirst for adventure.\n\nRegarded as one of Europe's most charming and beautiful cities, Prague has become the most popular travel destination in Central Europe along with Budapest and Krak\u00f3w. Millions of tourists visit the city every year.\nPrague was founded in the later 9th century, and soon became the seat of the Kings of Bohemia, some of whom ruled as Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. The city thrived under the rule of Charles IV, who ordered the building of the New Town in the 14th century. Many of the city's most important attractions date back to that age. In 1348 Prague became a university town, which it has remained ever since. The University, which is sometimes claimed to be the oldest in Central Europe was split into a German and a Czech language part in 1882 with the German language part shut down in 1945, thus ending the claim of the \"oldest German university\" Prague might have reasonably held until then. The city also went under Habsburg rule and became the capital of a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It had a German-speaking majority well into the 19th century, and even after then, maintained a significant German-speaking minority until the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia following World War II. During that period, Prague would give rise to several prominent German-language authors, perhaps the most notable being Franz Kafka, known for works such as Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis) and  Der Process (The Trial). In 1918, after World War I, the city became the capital of Czechoslovakia. After 1989 many foreigners, especially young people, moved to Prague. In 1992, its historic centre was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 1993, Czechoslovakia split into two countries and Prague became the capital of the new Czech Republic.\nThe Vltava River runs through Prague, which is home to about 1.2 million people. The capital may be beautiful, but smog often accumulates in the Vltava River basin.\n\n\nClimate\n\nPrague has a humid continental climate, with relatively cold winters (around the point of freezing). Snow cover occurs between mid-November and late March. The snow cover rarely stays around for more than a week or two. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and the average high temperature of 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). Precipitation in Prague is rather low, the driest season usually being the winter. During late spring and summer heavy rain may occur, often in the form of thundershowers. Temperature inversions are relatively common around winter, bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of 16 km/h (9.9 mph).\n\n\nTourist information\n\nTourist information is available online at Prague.eu.\nThe city has 3 tourist information centres (TIC) in the city and another 2 at both airport terminals:\n\n1 TIC \u2013 Old Town Hall (Starom\u011bstsk\u00e1 radnice), Starom\u011bstsk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 1, tourinfo@prague.eu.

Information booth right on Wenceslas Square. (updated Sep 2018)\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Czech phrasebook\nCzech is the official language of Prague and the Czech Republic. Simple words and phrases in other Slavic languages (for example Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian, Bulgarian and Polish) are also commonly understood. Slovak and Czech are very similar and mutually intelligible.\nMost young people speak English very well, you will also have no problem speaking English at restaurants and bars. Many restaurants have English menus. Russian is widely understood by people who were attending school before the Velvet Revolution in 1989, but the language is too different from Czech to be understood without study. In addition, some people may dislike using Russian even if they know it because of the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Communist history in general. Many Czechs also have some knowledge of German. People studying after 1989 and even some older people can speak English. However, learning Czech will surely endear you to the locals.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nSee also: V\u00e1clav Havel Airport Prague\n\n1 V\u00e1clav Havel Airport Prague (PRG  IATA) (20 km (12 mi) north-west of the city centre. It generally takes about 30 minutes to reach the city centre by car.), \u260f +420 220 111 111, +420 296 661 111. The airport is a relatively safe place, but there have been reports of small item theft when going through airport security. You can largely mitigate these concerns by putting valuable small items within a larger bag.   \n\n\nGetting in from the airport\nBy bus \u2013 Public buses offer connections to several metro stations, from which you can travel to the city center in a total travel time of 35-45 minutes. Public transport tickets, which are valid on the buses, metro, and trams can be bought kiosks called Metro \u2022 Tram \u2022 Bus in the arrivals halls (07:00\u201321:00, credit cards accepted) or faster at the yellow vending machine next to the bus stop outside both terminals (cards accepted). A ticket valid for 90 minutes is required for travel to the city center (40 K\u010d).  Children under 15 and seniors (65 and older) travel for free. You can transfer between the buses, metro, and trams for no additional charge as long as your ticket has not expired. Info on the schedules and routes can be obtained from dpp.cz or pid.cz. The following important buses run between the airport and metro stations (airport bus stops are called \"Termin\u00e1l 1\" or \"Termin\u00e1l 2\"):\n\nT-Bus  59  to metro station N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Veleslav\u00edn  A  (17 min). Departures every 3-5 minutes, Sunday morning and every evening 10 minutes; 04:23\u201323:32. Main and generally fastest connection.\nBus  100  to metro station Zli\u010d\u00edn  B  (18 min). Departures every 15 minutes, Sunday morning and every evening 20 minutes; 05:40\u201323:16.\nBus  191  to Na Kn\u00ed\u017eec\u00ed bus station (And\u011bl  B ) - slow and less frequent bus, though may be useful for trips to the western part of town, including the And\u011bl area. Also connects to metro A at Pet\u0159iny  A .\nNight buses  910  and  907  - the only options at night. The 910 goes directly to the centre, with stops at Jir\u00e1skovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed, Karlovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed and I.P. Pavlova.\nBy Airport Express  AE  \u2013  These buses leave the airport from public bus stop called \"Termin\u00e1l 1\" (see above) every \u00bd hr; 05:30\u201321:00. Tickets cost 100 K\u010d and are not transferable, nor valid for any other service. Available from the driver (contactless accepted) or at Public Transport counters at arrivals in both terminals. The final stop will be Prague's main train station Hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed  C , which is commonly abbreviated in Czech as \"Praha hl.n.\". This bus is suitable only for transport to the train station and the surrounding area. The Airport Express' high price and low frequency makes it unattractive compared to bus 59, though it offers the added convenience of a direct, non-stop connection to the central train station.\nBy taxi \u2013 The most comfortable method to reach the city centre with Uber Airport Taxi. They have an exclusive contract with Prague airport and taxis \u2013 black or white limousines \u2013 are waiting in front of the arrival halls of both terminals. Order through the Uber app or using self-service kiosks at baggage claim and nearby airport exits.\nBy rental car \u2013 If you are planning on exploring the Czech Republic beyond the city of Prague, you may want to consider renting a car at the airport. Numerous rental companies have their desks at the airport (in the ground floor of Parking C) and allow pickup and return directly there.\nBy intercity bus - Regiojet stops in front of Terminal 1 on the route to Karlovy Vary\n\n\nGetting money at the airport\nCredit cards are widely accepted in Prague and the rest of the country - it's likely you won't even need cash during your visit. A small amount of pocket money might be good to have though.  \nIf not completely necessary, do not exchange money on the airport, especially in the baggage claim area. There is only one exchange company, Interchange, which runs all the exchange kiosks at the whole airport. Their rates are extremely bad. \nATM withdrawal is almost always a better option. Use any ATM except those of Euronet, as these charge an extra fee and give only 1,000 K\u010d banknotes, which are too large. You can also pay your transportation tickets or taxi by card (including Google Pay and Apple Pay).\n\n\nBy train\nMain article: Rail travel in the Czech Republic\n\n2 Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed (Praha hl.n.). The main station, for all long-distance trains, which has its own metro station, on Line C.Beware of the taxi drivers operating from the (official-looking) taxi rank alongside Praha hl.n.\u2014they will attempt to charge a fixed price of 1,760 K\u010d for a trip within the city centre zone, or more than this if you want to travel further. Also, beware the money exchange kiosks; most offer terrible exchange rates or charge a hefty fee. The Czech Railways company runs their own exchange office in one of the ticket desks with reasonable exchange rates, but withdrawing money from an ATM is usually the best idea unless your home bank charges a huge fee. Avoid using Euronet ATMs, as these charge you a fee and have only 1,000 K\u010d banknotes, which is unheard of when using other ATMs.The park in front of the main train station used to be a haven for some unwanted elements. Now the situation is better, but after dark it is better to avoid it and leave the station by metro. If you have to walk, it is better to go straight from the station to Opletalova Street.   (updated Aug 2023)\n3 Praha-Hole\u0161ovice (N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hole\u0161ovice  C , 5 km north of city centre). International trains from Dresden and Berlin all call at Praha-Hole\u0161ovice station with most continuing to Praha hl.n afterwards. Occasionally, due to engineering words, through-trains bypass Praha hlavn\u00ed and call only at Hole\u0161ovice. In case you have to alight here and need to get to the centre, use the metro C line   (updated Feb 2024)\n4 Masarykovo n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed (N\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed republiky  B ). Many other local trains depart from this nearby railway station.   (updated Aug 2023)\n5 Praha-Sm\u00edchov (Sm\u00edchovsk\u00e9 n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed  B ). This station is served by international trains from Munich and intercity services from Cheb which can be connected to from Nuremberg. These trains all continue to Praha hl.n afterwards.   (updated Feb 2024)\n\nPrague is well connected to the European EC train network. However, there is no Czech high speed rail. Usually the average speed is about 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph), while the maximum train speed is 120\u2013160 kilometres per hour (75\u201399 mph). While international and intercity services are generally reliable, be prepared for delays of more than a few minutes when using local trains.\n\nBerlin \u2013 4\u00bd hr, EC trains every 2 hours, from \u20ac14 if bought in advance (3-90 days) on the Czech Railway website or Deutsche Bahn website (check both for the best price). This railway crosses Saxon Switzerland, and for a couple of hours the passengers are treated to a series of beautiful alpine river valleys, surrounded by rocky escarpments and mountains. Coming from Berlin, the best views are from the left side of the train.\nMunich \u2013 6 hr, 3 EC a day from each city, \u20ac14 if bought in advance (3-90 days) on Czech Railway website\nNuremberg \u2013 5 hr, hourly, with a change at Schwandorf.

It's run by Regiojet, single \u20ac25\u201390, booking essential.\n\n\nBy bus\n6 \u00daAN Praha-Florenc (Florenc  B  C , east of the city centre). This is the main bus station for international buses in Prague.   (updated Aug 2023)\n7 Na Kn\u00ed\u017eec\u00ed (And\u011bl  B , next to Vltava river at west bank, south of city center). The second largest bus station, it is used mostly by regional buses and buses to \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov.  (updated Aug 2023)\nOther, less frequently used bus stations are at Dejvick\u00e1  A , \u010cern\u00fd most  B , Zli\u010d\u00edn  B , N\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed Hole\u0161ovice  C  and Roztyly  C .\nEurolines, Ecolines, RegioJet and Orange Ways connect Prague to major European cities. Since the liberalization of the German long-distance bus market almost all major operators offer routes to Prague. Flixbus goes from Berlin (via Dresden) as well as Linz Munich and Regensburg to Prague. Tickets for Flixbus can be bought online or paid in euros at the bus (higher rates apply, only possible if there are still seats).\nRegiojet operates frequent bus services between many large Czech cities (including famous Cesky Krumlov) and Prague for prices between 80 and 200 K\u010d per adult (reservation needed), it supposedly provides better service (steward, complimentary coffee and tea, free Wi-Fi, personal multimedia system in each seat) than its main competitor Flixbus, but the buses can feel kind of narrow if you are claustrophobic.\nBudweis-shuttle operates daily bus service between \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Cesky Krumlov and Prague (1.5 hours; disadvantageous for small groups)\nPolski Bus joined Flixbus and has 2 connections daily to Warsaw, Poland via Wroc\u0142aw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\n\n\nBy car\nPrague has highway connections from five major directions. Unfortunately, the highway network in the Czech Republic is quite incomplete and some highways are old and in poor condition. Thus, the highway connection from Prague to the border of the Czech Republic is available only in three directions: southeast, southwest and northwest.\nThe southwestern highway (D5; international E50) leads from highway A6 in Germany through Plze\u0148. Driving from the state border to Prague takes about an hour and a half (160 km (99 mi)).\nThe southeastern motorway (D1) is the oldest and most used motorway in the Czech Republic and its reconstruction was completed in 2021. It runs from Prague to Brno and then to Ostrava. It runs for 250 km (160 mi), and usually takes over two hours. In Brno it is connected to the D2 motorway to Bratislava (Slovakia). It offers a good connection from Vienna, Budapest and all traffic from the east. \nFrom the northwest, you can take E55 all the way from Sweden. In Germany it runs from Rostock via Dresden, the last stretch known as A17. After the border it continues as D8 (E55). It passes through Lovosice and \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem.\nFrom the northeast, you can take highway R10 (E65). It is strictly speaking a motorway, not a highway, but it has four lanes and differs little from a highway. It leads from Liberec to Turnov. It is not regarded as an important access route, as there are no major cities in this direction (Zittau in Germany, some cities in Poland), but it offers a good connection to the Czech mountains Jizersk\u00e9 hory and Krkono\u0161e (Riesengebirge) with the best Czech skiing resorts.\nTo the east, you can take the newly completed D11 (E67), which goes to Hradec Kralove. It leads in from Poland.\nCzech highways are under development (D11 is being extended, D3 to \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and Linz is supposed to be completed in 2029), so things will get better. Unless there are road works, there are only seldom traffic jams on Czech highways, with the exception of D1 near Prague (and near Mirosovice (direction to \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and Linz, and Brno, too)).\nPrague suffers from heavy traffic and on weekdays the main streets are one big traffic jam. Moreover, Prague doesn't have a complete highway outer ring yet. It is a really good idea to use the P+R (park and ride) parking places, where you can park your car for a very small fee and use public transport.\nThe P+Rs are situated near all highways and are well marked. Note that traffic wardens are rife and parking in most residential streets in and around Prague city centre (even after dark) without a valid permit will result in a parking fine. In particular, avoid blue-marked areas which are parking-restricted area if you don't want your car to get towed away within the hour.\n\n\nGet around\nPublic transportation is very convenient in most of the areas visitors are likely to frequent. Public transport buses do not enter the historic districts (Old Town, New Town, Lower Town, etc.) to prevent air and noise pollution. One must transfer to a cleaner and quieter electric-powered tram or a metro before reaching historic areas.\n\n\nOn foot\nPrague is renowned as a very walkable city. For those who enjoy seeing the old and new city by foot, one can easily walk from Wenceslas Square to the Old Town Square, or from the Old Town to Charles Bridge and the Castle District. However almost all of the streets are cobbled, rendering it very difficult for disabled or elderly travellers to get around effectively. Also, pedestrians should enter crosswalks carefully in Prague, as drivers are not as likely to yield as they are in other European cities.\nPedestrians are obligated to use a nearby pedestrian crossing, and jaywalking is punishable by a fine of 1000 K\u010d \u2013 this includes crossing the street on a \"don't walk\" signal (red man), even when there is not a single car around.\n\n\nBy public transport\n\nThe public transport around Prague consists of three metro lines ( A ,  B ,  C ), over twenty tram lines (numbered using 1- or 2-digit numbers), buses (3-digit numbers), ferries, a few train lines (numbered S1, S2, S49,\u2026), and one funicular, all using the same tickets. Public transport schedules and fares are integrated by Pra\u017esk\u00e1 Integrovan\u00e1 Doprava (abbreviated PID).\nThe tram and bus schedules are posted at the stops, and the metro (its schedule is posted in station) operates from early in the morning (around 05:00) until approximately midnight. Buses (lines no. 100-299) and trams (lines no. 1-26) start earlier and end later to connect to metro. Around midnight, some trams carrying passengers take different routes to get to their garage. When travelling at night, always check schedules on-line beforehand, and you may even find a shorter route to your destination than normally available.\nWhen planning a journey, if you know the names of your stops, you can use the official journey planner, the official smartphone app PID L\u00edta\u010dka (iOS, Android) which also sells tickets or an alternative smartphone app (two good ones for Android are J\u00edzdn\u00ed \u0159\u00e1dy/Pubtran, which is free of charge but uses your data plan to find connections, or CG transit, which allows you to download the timetables into your phone for a small charge and then use them offline). Add five minutes to any journey time when using the metro \u2013 it is very deep as it was built as an atomic shelter in the communist era, thus getting down to the platform takes some time. Because of this, tram is a more convenient option when going only a few stops.\nIf you don't know the name of your stop, you can plan your journey either using Google Maps or with mapy.cz. You can also look at several public transport maps, but be aware that at any given moment there are several lines closed for renovations, which is reflected by the online planners but may not always be included in the static maps. Official Route planner may help if you know the local names of the places.\nPrague's public transport is fast and efficient when you know how to use it. Sometimes you have to change a few times \u2013 the schedule website or the official smartphone app is the best way to plan your trip. If you get lost, you can take any bus or tram, all lines pass through a metro station where you can orient yourself.\nThese tickets may be of interest to visitors (Nov 2023):\n\n30 K\u010d \u2013 full ticket: 30 minutes (transfers allowed), not valid on the Pet\u0159\u00edn funicular\n40 K\u010d \u2013 full ticket: 90 minutes (transfers allowed), not valid on the Pet\u0159\u00edn funicular\n120 K\u010d \u2013 24-hour ticket,\n330 K\u010d \u2013 3-day ticket (72 hours)\n240 K\u010d - 24-hour ticket for all zones of PID (Prague integrated transport system) - covering all urban and suburban transport in Prague and Central Bohemian Region\nFor longer stays, you may consider purchasing the 550 K\u010d 30-day pass, which can also be obtained through the PID L\u00edta\u010dka app (registration, uploading a photo and an initial setup in the app is needed to purchase such a pass). This will also let you use the Nextbike and Rekola bike sharing services in the city for up to 2 rides daily, 15 minutes each, for free (you need to link your L\u00edta\u010dka account in the respective bike provider's smartphone application).\nChildren under 15 and seniors (65 and older) travel for free. A proof of age is needed for children aged 10 to 14 and for seniors. Seniors from 60 to 64 can get discounted tickets. For 30-minute, 90-minute and 24-hour tickets, you can prove your age with your EU national ID or passport. For monthly and yearly tickets you need a PID-Card from the transport company \u2013 you should organize a card before travelling. A monthly card in this age cost 130 K\u010d.\nWhen in doubt, you can visit one of the official points of sale, preferably one of the \"Information centres\" where the staff is likely to speak good English.\nAs you can see, the 24-hour or 3-day tickets are not economical unless you plan to travel more than 4 times a day for 90 minutes (6 hours). However, the PID L\u00edta\u010dka app features a day cap so it will not charge you more than the price of the 24-hour ticket even when buying individual tickets.\nTickets can be bought at various places:\n\nthe official smartphone app PID L\u00edta\u010dka (iOS, Android) \u2013 Recommended option. Lets you buy the right ticket for your planned journey, 24-hour as well as 72-hour tickets and caps your spending to the price of a 24-hour ticket. It is utterly important to know that the ticket becomes valid just 2 minutes after activation. When you do not follow this rule, i.e. buy the ticket and immediately enter the vehicle or the metro, you might be fined. This is supposed to be fraud prevention. The app works in Czech, English and Ukrainian language and offers also tickets for suburban transport in Central Bohemian Region. During ticket inspection (or boarding suburban bus) you will show QR-code on your cellphone.\nticket machines on the street \u2013 Most ticket machines accept cards (some only contactless) but although unlikely, you may still encounter an older ticket machine accepting coins only (but return change). In most central locations such as the central train station, there are new touch-screen ticket machines that accept coins, 100 K\u010d and 200 K\u010d notes, Visa and MasterCard credit cards (\"classic\" as well as contactless cards) and their debit versions. Problems can occur with foreign debit cards.\nticket machines inside trams/buses \u2013 if you have contactless card you can buy ticket also inside the tram immediately after boarding \u2013 use the middle door with sign of the ticket machine (this system is being expanded to all trams). As of 2023 the on-board ticket machines are available in all trams and buses.\ntobacco shops, convenience stores \u2013 usually 30 and 40 K\u010d tickets only\nPrague Public Transit offices \u2013 usually at Metro stations (and the airport), sell all kinds of tickets\nall Czech Railways ticket offices \u2013 sell the 120 K\u010d tickets (validity is printed on the ticket, so ask them to set it to the date and time you need)\nvia SMS \u2013 service is available only for the Czech GSM operator customers, the tickets are more expensive and not valid on the S-Train services.\n\nValidate your paper ticket by slipping it into one of the yellow boxes in the tram, bus or ferry, as soon as you board. In the metro, on the S-trains and on the funicular, the validators are in stations instead of the vehicles. After having changed the tram/bus, do not validate it again, as doing so will render your ticket in invalid. Keep it until it expires. If you are using the PID L\u00edta\u010dka ticket, make sure it is active before you enter the vehicle or the metro station. Tickets of either type must be valid for the whole duration of your journey.\nTickets are not checked upon boarding, but uniformed or plain-clothed ticket inspectors often make the rounds asking to see your ticket. One problem is false inspectors who most often ride the trams between \"Malostransk\u00e9 N\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed\" and Prague Castle \u2013 these deceivers can be detected by asking for the identity card and badge which should be possessed by every inspector. An unstamped ticket, or a ticket that has been stamped more than once, is invalid. It will be confiscated, and you will incur a 1,000 K\u010d fine. Even though \"riding black\" seems easy in Prague, you should invest in the cheap ticket for the simple reason that Prague's transportation works perfectly and it functions on the honour system \u2013 help it stay that way.\nSome buses (number 300 to 499) and all S-trains go out of the city, so they work a little differently, because normal tickets are valid only within the city limits. You have to show your ticket to the bus driver or train conductor and possibly buy another ticket from them, if you plan to go out of the city. The most popular site reachable this way is the Karl\u0161tejn castle (train S7, leaving the main station every 30 minutes). With a valid 24-hour, 72-hour or 30-day ticket/pass, you only need to buy the extension zones (1 to 11, 12,\u2026) as your Prague leg of the journey (zones P, 0, B) is already covered by your Prague ticket.\nPublic transport continues at night and it's fairly extensive. Night trams or night buses (00:00 to 05:00; lines beginning with the number 9) usually come every 30 minutes (and every 20 min on Fridays and Saturdays). Every 15 (10) minutes during this time, trams leave the central exchange stop of Lazarsk\u00e1 in the centre of Prague. All night trams go through this stop. You can easily change tram lines here if nowhere else. At all night exchange stops, trams and buses wait for the connecting tram/bus.\nDo not underestimate how close to the footpath the trams will be when they reach the stop. It's safer to take a few steps back before the tram arrives, as wing mirrors could cause injury for taller people. In the Metro, you should stay behind the dashed safety line on the floor about half a meter from the edge of the platform. On an escalator, it is customary to stand on the right side and walk up on the left side. It is good etiquette to let elderly people, pregnant women or disabled people sit down on public transit.\n\n\nBy funicular\n\nEvery 15 minutes a funicular runs to the top of Pet\u0159\u00edn Hill. The funicular has three stops, one at the foot of the hill, one halfway and one at the top. The full journey takes around 5 minutes and provides nice views of the city. Tickets can be purchased at the stops and cost 60 K\u010d. Make sure that the ticket is validated correctly. Paper tickets need to be stamped correctly at the machine to be validated. Contactless tickets do not need to be stamped by the machine but have to be tapped and used right away. Ordinary (multi)day public transport tickets are also valid. You do not need to validate the multi-day ticket again at the funicular stop (if you do, the entire ticket becomes invalidated). Ticket inspectors are often stationed at the stop at the top and ready to catch anyone holding an invalid ticket to give out 1000 K\u010d fine. The free travel rules of Prague public transport also apply here, so you can travel for free if you are under the age of 15 or over the age of 65.\n\n\nBy taxi\n\nThere's little reason to use taxis for sightseeing \u2013 public transportation is often a better option. But if you want to use taxis for any reason, your best bet is using one of the taxi apps, or major taxi services \u2013 and not trying to flag them on the road.\nThe advantage of using a taxi app for a taxi is that you get a decent price, all payments are done by card, there's no need to call anyone, and you can get a taxi at any time in less than 10 minutes. So in this case, there's little space for fraud. Both Uber and Taxify can get pretty expensive on Friday evenings though. Popular options include:\n\nLiftago, the local equivalent to Uber, which uses official cabs and therefore without risk of conflicts with police. New clients get a 300 K\u010d bonus for signing up. The app is available for Android and iOS.\nUber, the global taxi giant. If you already have an account from any other country, you can use it in Prague as well. The app is available for Android and iOS. Uber applies an additional surcharge for travelling from the airport; in busy hours it may also charge you more than the maximum allowed rate for Prague (28 K\u010d/km). As Uber is not an official taxi it can be slower in rush hours because it is not allowed to use dedicated lanes on the roads.\nBolt, another large player. They often offer discount codes and are a little bit cheaper than Uber. The app is available for Android and iOS. Officially illegal like Uber but without any risk for passengers.\nThe major taxi operators follow the rules, so you can expect them to (do insist) have the taxi-meter turned on, and to give you a printed receipt once you leave the taxi. The receipt should have the driver's name, address and tax identification number included. You can also try to negotiate the price in advance, though the official maximum price designated by the city council is 28 K\u010d/km (approx. \u20ac1.30). The rate is lower if you make an order online or via a phone call. Here's a non-complete list of advisable services:\n\n AAA Radiotaxi, \u260f +420 222 333 222. 20-28 K\u010d/km. \n Green Prague, \u260f +420 721 111 112. \u0160koda Octavia G-Tec cars, free wifi, cards always accepted; basic 28 K\u010d/km, online 20 K\u010d/km.

(updated Apr 2019)\n\n\nBy boat\n\nYou can travel down the famous Vltava River, which inspired writers and composers such as Smetana and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k.\nThe Prague Steamboat Company offers sight seeing cruises and trips to the Prague Zoo or the Slapy River Dam.\nThere also few small passenger ferries across the river, integrated with the Prague's public transport tariff. Some of them are even free.\nOr you can enjoy travel by boat in the historic centre of Prague. The nice surroundings include Pra\u017esk\u00e9 Ben\u00e1tky. Try to travel with Pra\u017esk\u00e9 Ben\u00e1tky Company and enjoy historic cruises as well as way to visit Charles Bridge Museum (Muzeum Karlova Mostu). Avoid the touts selling boat tours to tourists in the Charles bridge area, and check for everything online.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nPrague is not very bike friendly city but the cycling infrastructure is slowly improving. Even though there are some bike lanes on the streets and bike paths, these usually pop out and end randomly. Also, Prague is quite hilly so biking is sometimes a bit challenging. If you still want the use a bike, you can use the Rekola or Nextbike app. Both providers offer pay-as-you-go as well as subscription models. With a valid 30-day or longer public transport pass, you get up to 2 rides a day for free, 15 minutes each. For a longer ride, use mapy.cz to find a good route. Biking in the center is a pain, mainly because of the crowds and tramway tracks. Be always respectful to pedestrians as well as other users of the roads. There are however some nice biking paths, such as the one connecting the main railway station an Krejc\u00e1rek through lower part of \u017di\u017ekov district or along the rivers.\n\n\nSee\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Prague's district articles\n1 Prague Castle.

Its construction started in the 14th century and it is one of Prague's most beautiful structures.

Prague's historic centre includes numerous historic buildings and monuments, most notably the famed 4 Astronomical Clock (Orloj), the pure Gothic 5 T\u00fdn Church, the mural-covered 6 Storch building, and the Jan Hus monument. Nearby, the Estate Theatre is a neoclassical theatre where Mozart's opera Don Giovanni was first performed. Old Town features many historical churches (St. James Church, Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn among others) and some other interesting historical buildings like the Old Town Hall.   \n7 Josefov. This historic Jewish ghetto is interesting for its well preserved synagogues. The Old New Synagogue (Czech: Staronov\u00e1 synagoga) is Europe's oldest active synagogue and it is rumoured to be the resting place of the famed Prague Golem. Another interesting synagogue is the Spanish Synagogue, a highly ornamental building of Moorish style. Other attractions include the Old Jewish Cemetery, which is the oldest in Europe, and Kafka's house. The Old New Synagogue is not a part of the Jewish museum, so if you wish to see everything, it is recommended that you buy a combined pass to all of the Jewish attractions for 480 K\u010d.   \n8 New Town (Nov\u00e9 m\u011bsto). New Town was established as an extension of Old Town in the 14th century, though much of the area has now been reconstructed. The main attraction here is Wenceslas Square, a rectangular commercial square with many stalls, shops and restaurants. At the top of the square is the National Museum which is well worth a look (see below). Midway down this historic boulevard, one finds trendy discos and Art Nouveau hotels, as well as quaint parks and arcades, while just off the beaten path are some wonderful panoramic views (Henry Tower), romantic restaurants and the dazzling, Disney-colored Jubilee Synagogue.   \n9 Lesser Town (Mal\u00e1 strana). Across the Vltava River from the city centre and leading to the castle, this quarter also offers beautiful streets and churches (of which St. Nicholas Church is the most renowned). The Lennon Wall, which used to be a source of irritation to the communist regime, is also found here, near a Venetian-like canal with water wheel and close to the Charles Bridge. On 17 November 2014, the Lennon Wall was vandalised by a group of art students and painted over in white.   \n10 Prague Dancing House (Tan\u010d\u00edc\u00ed d\u016fm, also known as \"Fred and Ginger\").

Its most important collections are in the Sternberg Palace (up to the Baroque), St George Convent (Czech Baroque and Mannerism) and Veletr\u017en\u00ed Palace. The first two are near and in the castle respectively. Do not confuse them with the Castle Picture Gallery (see above) which is worth visiting on its own right.   \n13 Veletr\u017en\u00ed Palace, Dukelsk\u00fdch hrdin\u016f 47, Praha 7 - Hole\u0161ovice. 19th century and modern art.   \n14 Convent of St Agnes of Bohemia, U Milosrdn\u00fdch 17, Praha 1.   \n15 Museum of Czech Cubism (House of the Black Madonna), Ovocn\u00fd trh 19/Celetn\u00e1 34, Praha 1.   \n16 Czech National Museum (N\u00e1rodn\u00ed muzeum).

It is at Poup\u011btova 1, Praha 7 near industrial district Hole\u0161ovice (subway red line C), and is quite long way from the centre but definitely worth to see. You can check the exhibitions during day (around 1-2 hr) and on the trip back to Hole\u0161ovice visit the legendary underground grown up Cross Club.  \n19 Jewish Museum. This covers six separate places (four synagogues, the Old Jewish Cemetery and the Memorial Hall) but does not include the Old-New Synagogue, although entrance tickets can either include or exclude the last named. The Old-New Synagogue is expensive in relation to the museum but in view of its age, it's worth including it. The Memorial Hall is particularly moving with exhibits of the writings of children in death camps.   \n20 Prague City Museum (Muzeum hl. m. Prahy), Na Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed 52, Praha 8.

All other banks and ATM chains take 99\u2013150 K\u010d and/or a 6\u201315% fee for currency conversion for a withdrawal.\nIn addition, any ATM might trick you into accepting Dynamic currency conversion (see DCC) \u2014 Euronet is notorious for this. Always decline DCC, as there is a big markup fee included in the offered exchange rate that will never compensate for any exchange rate insecurity. According to EU law, ATMs must always tell you if there is a fee or markup before confirming the transaction or exchange, so you can always cancel beforehand.\n\n\nForeign money\nSometimes it is also possible to pay with euros (hotels in the centre of Prague, McDonalds, KFC, Marks & Spencer \u2013 also accepts British pounds, Albert and Billa supermarkets, etc.), but the exchange rate may be slightly unfavourable and change is almost always given only in K\u010d. Dm-drogerie markt (cosmetics and health food) and New Yorker (clothing) stores accept euros at good rates, while souvenir stores take euros and US dollars at poor rates.\n\n\nMoney exchange\nIn Prague, especially around tourist sights, there are plenty of exchange offices with very bad rates and misleading advertisements (often advertising 0% commission, but providing only nearly half of the official exchange rate). Good rates are found for example:\n\neXchange sro is the main currency exchange office used by expats in Prague. The VIP rates advertised outside the offices likely aren't available to tourists, but non-VIP rates inside tend to only have 1% spreads. The main office with best rates is located at \u0160tef\u00e1nikova 203/23 and a second office with worse but also fair rates is close to the Old Town Square (Kaprova 14/13).\nBanks such as \u010cesk\u00e1 spo\u0159itelna have acceptable rates, but charge a commission.\nAround Main Railway Station (Hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed): exit the station, go left across the park to street \"Politick\u00fdch v\u011bz\u0148\u016f\". There are about 5 offices, mostly Arab-owned, and offer very good rates even for smaller amounts, and even better or negotiable for higher (over \u20ac1000, US$1000 or such). Actively avoid offices inside the main station: exchange rates are abysmal there.\nBy law, if you keep your currency exchange receipt, you have 3 hours to return to that exchange office to reverse the transaction in case you fell victim to a bad exchange rate.\nMake sure you do not exchange money with strangers offering good rates on the street. You are likely to end up with worthless currency, such as expired Belarusian rubles or Bulgarian leva, and no way of getting your money back. Although not as common anymore, some smaller stores may attempt to con you by providing similar-looking Belarusian rubles as change.\n\n\nShopping\n\nThe streets around Old Town are full of gift shops geared towards tourists, selling Bohemian crystal, soccer shirts and other mass-produced memorabilia. The thoroughfare between Charles Bridge and Old Town Square is particularly bad, turning off into one of the laneways you can find exactly the same merchandise for half the price. If you are looking for some decent souvenirs, try to get off the beaten path. Street vendors can have some unexpected treasures and there are plenty in the Charles Bridge area. Prints of paintings and good quality photos are very popular, and a really good way to remember Prague. Don't bother buying overpriced furry hats and Matryoshka dolls, though \u2013 they have nothing to do with Prague: they are Russian in origin, and their sellers are just trying to capitalize on unknowing tourists.\nIn December, the squares host Christmas Markets selling a mix of arts, craft, food, drink and Prague memorabilia. The markets are an attraction in their own right and a great place to pick up a more unique memento of the city. There is a small market in front of the Palladium Mall that is open even in the spring.\nThere are several large shopping malls in Prague, you should take \"Na Prikope\" street \u2013 the 18th most expensive street in the world (measured by the price of property), with famous shopping arcades \"Cerna ruze\" (Black rose) and \"Palac Myslbek\" and many shops. If you are looking for souvenir shops, you will find them in the city's historical centre \u2013 mostly around Old Town Square, Wenceslas Square and Prague Castle. There are many other shops offering Bohemian crystal, especially in the centre near the lower end of Wenceslas Square.\nThe other typical (if rather expensive) Czech goods is the garnet jewellery. Typical Czech garnet stones (gathered near the town of Turnov) are dark red and nowadays are produced by a single company, Granat Turnov, and if you buy genuine traditional Czech garnet, you should get a certificate of authenticity.\n\"Pa\u0159\u00ed\u017esk\u00e1\" street goes from Old Town Square towards the river and includes some of the most luxurious (and expensive) boutiques in Prague.\n\n\nPopular shopping malls\n1 Ark\u00e1dy Pankr\u00e1c. A small-ish shopping centre with mostly higher-class shops, hypermarket and food court. (updated Jan 2018)\n2 Atrium Flora (Pal\u00e1c Flora), Vinohradsk\u00e1 2828/151. Medium-sized shopping mall with IMAX cinema in the top floor. Tram/metro station Flora  A . \n3 Centrum \u010cern\u00fd Most, Chlumeck\u00e1 765/6. A huge shopping mall with hypermarket and cinemas, slightly further away from the centre at metro station \u010cern\u00fd Most  B . IKEA and other big shops nearby. \n4 Centrum Chodov, Roztylsk\u00e1 2321/19, \u260f +420 272 173 600. The biggest shopping mall of the country, with hypermarket. It is slightly further away from the centre at metro station Chodov  C .   \n5 Let\u0148any. A relatively remote shopping center, used mostly by the citizens living in the surroundings. It's quite big nevertheless, with a further big shopping malls in the vicinity. (updated Jan 2018)\n6 Metropole Zli\u010d\u00edn, \u0158evnick\u00e1 1. Medium-sized mall with a cinema, hypermarket Interspar, fast foods, huge parking lot and near the metro/bus station Zli\u010d\u00edn  B . IKEA nearby. If you are hungry after your flight, take a bus 100 from the airport to Zli\u010d\u00edn and then just walk few metres to this mall and buy something to eat. \n7  Nov\u00fd Sm\u00edchov, Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 8. Big shopping mall with 2-floor Tesco hypermarket, a cinema, a number fast food restaurants on the top floor and very close to metro/tram station And\u011bl  B . \n8 Palladium, n\u00e1m. Republiky 1 (Tram/metro station Namesti Republiky  B ), \u260f +420 225 770 250. In the city centre, next to the main city (shopping) streets. It is among the newest shopping malls, and is perhaps the most luxurious one. It's complex inside, so you'll need a while to walk through it. No cheap options to eat, unless you buy some food in Albert supermarket on the lowest floor (-2). On the top level (+2) are some moderate to expensive restaurants. \n9 \u0160estka, Fajtlova 1. A shopping mall 1 station from the Prague Airport, but otherwise very far away from the center. Ideal for last minute shopping before your departure, also because it's far less busy than other shopping centers. Take bus 191 from Pet\u0159iny  A  metro station. \n\n\nEat\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Prague's district articles\n\nLunch is traditionally the main meal in Prague. Czech cuisine is typically based around pork or beef with starchy side dishes such as dumplings, potatoes, or fries. Fish is not as popular, though these days it is widely available. Popular Czech desserts include fruit dumplings (ovocn\u00e9 knedl\u00edky), cr\u00eapes or ice cream. Trdeln\u00edk has become popular in Prague among tourists, with many small bakeries selling the sweet bread encrusted with sugar and chopped walnuts, but it is not a traditional Czech dish, and only started appearing in the 1990s; most locals avoid it. Most restaurants become very crowded during lunch and dinner, so consider making a reservation or eating earlier than the locals.\nThe tip should be about 10 to 15% \u2013 in cheaper restaurants or pubs you can get away with rounding up the note or leaving a few extra coins. Otherwise, it's customary to leave at least 20\u201340 K\u010d or \u20ac1\u20132. Taxes are always included in the price by law. Many restaurants in heavily-touristed areas (along the river, or with views near the castle) will charge a cover or \"kovert\" in addition to your meal charge. If this is printed in the menu, you have no recourse. But a restaurant will often add this charge to your bill in a less up-front manner, sometimes after printing in the menu that there is no cover. Anything brought to your table will have a charge associated with it (bread, ketchup, etc.) If you are presented with a hand-scrawled bill at the end of the meal, it is suggested that you take a moment to clarify the charges with your server. This sort of questioning will usually shame the server into removing anything that was incorrectly added. Some waiters might be impolite especially to people from eastern Europe. Pay no attention to this, and simply find another restaurant.\nIf you're on the look out for fast food, you won't be able to move without tripping over street vendors serving Czech style hot dogs and mulled wine in the Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square in New Town. If you're after Western-style fast food, the major chains also have a large presence in Wenceslas Square and the area immediately around it. Most beer halls also serve light snacks or meals. Definitely try the hot dogs (p\u00e1rek v rohl\u00edku) \u2013 they're very different to the version you get in the West. Small, hollowed-out French baguettes are used for the bread, filled with mustard and ketchup, and then the frankfurter is inserted afterward. This turns the bread into a convenient carry-case and means you don't get ketchup all over your hands. Make sure you get mustard, even if you don't normally like it \u2013 unfortunately the hot dogs are somewhat flavourless and need that extra bit of kick. Prices range from around 15 K\u010d for a small one to 45 K\u010d for the terrifying-looking 'gigant' (as of 2010). Note that the size of hot dog relates to girth rather than length. Another local snack to look out for is chleb\u00ed\u010dek, a small open-faced sandwich with a wide variety of toppings to choose from. This can be found at supermarkets and in specialist shops.\nBe careful when ordering food without looking at the prices. There are many places in the centre that are known for charging horrible prices from people who did not look into the menu. Charging more than 250 K\u010d (July 2022) for a basic local lunch is too much, even in tourist-heavy areas. Especially restaurants with large outdoor spaces at Old Town square are known for charging extraordinary prices for a simple meal. If a restaurant touts itself as \"Czech\" and \"traditional\", it might be another sign of potential rip-off \u2013 truly traditional restaurants never advertise themselves as traditional. If outside tourist areas, meals can be found for 175 K\u010d or less (July 2022).\nAnother common scam connected to food is charging for food by weight. They, for example, say that the price is 100 K\u010d, but do not mention that the price is for 100 grams, leaving you to pay 400 K\u010d for a basic meal. This is especially common at the Old Town square, at the stalls with 'Prague Ham'. Requests for smaller portions will generally be refused unless you get a local to buy it for you.\nFor specific restaurant suggestions in the popular Old Town neighbourhood, have a look into the dedicated  article.\n\n\nDrink\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Prague's district articles\nPubs (in Czech \"hospoda\") abound throughout Prague, and indeed are an important part of local culture. The exact brand of beer usually vary from pub to pub, and recommendations are difficult to give as natives are usually willing to argue at lengths about their preferences. The most internationally recognized beers are Pilsner Urquell (Plze\u0148sk\u00fd Prazdroj) and Budweiser Budvar (Bud\u011bjovick\u00fd Budvar). There are other brands famous among Czechs like Svijany. If you are looking for a beer brewed in Prague, go for Staropramen. Usual prices for a half-liter glass are between 25 and 40 K\u010d, based on the brand and locality, while certain restaurants at tourist areas like the Old Town Square are known to charge more than 100 K\u010d for a euro-sized glass. There's also a booming craft beer scene with many brewpubs in the city.\nIn Prague it is customary, especially at beer halls, to sit with a group of people if there are no free tables, so go ahead and ask if you can join.\nThere are also numerous night-clubs in Prague. Not all of them are good, it is often quite difficult even for locals to find the right one, as some are often overpriced, empty or just bad. Locals tend to go to clubs at around midnight, mostly on Friday and Saturday, but Wednesdays and Thursdays are often also OK. In summer, any day of the week should be fine, as there are many foreigners. Most of the night-clubs are in the centre of Prague, although there are some a bit further, mostly aimed at local students. Nightclubs are generally much more expensive than pubs, with beer costing between 50 and 100 K\u010d. Entrance fees should be small, do not pay more than 100 K\u010d for entrance unless there is some really good DJ playing.\nIt is very common to see people drinking outside. It is forbidden to drink at many public places. There are however many public parks where it is not forbidden to drink and where it is very popular to drink. Young people often predrink in parks or at riversides and then head to some club in the center. Even if you drink on places where it is forbidden, police will probably not bother you, but they might use it against you if you are too disruptive to your surrounding.\nPrague has also many excellent tearooms (in Czech \u010dajovna) which serve different kinds of teas from around the world. Shishas (hookas) are often smoked in these tearooms (smoking ban does not apply to shishas) .\n\n\nPubcrawls\nSave your money and find the bars yourself \u2013 you might be surprised at the discoveries you make away from the tourist circus.\n\nIndividual listings can be found in Prague's district articles\n\n\nSleep\nPrague has a wealth of accommodation options, many of them within walking distance of the town center. Peak season generally runs from April to October and a major influx of visitors can be expected during New Year as well. Prices for accommodation can be up to twice as high in the peak season and reservations are advised. Otherwise, the main train station, Hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed, has an accommodation booking service for hotels and hostels upstairs. Normally, tax and breakfast are included in the room rate.\nAround Hlavni Nadrazi, the main train station, there are many touts offering cheap accommodation. Many are Czech residents renting part of their apartment for extra cash. Prices don't vary much between them, but some may not be trustworthy so be cautious.\nEven during peak season, dorm rooms in hostels close to the city center can be had for around 350 K\u010d (\u20ac14) per person per night. Prague has its share of rough and ready youth hostels with a party vibe, but there are many with a more relaxed atmosphere and some housed in beautifully restored buildings as fancy as any hotel. Many hostels also offer private rooms, with or without shared bathrooms, for much cheaper than a pension or hotel room. There is a boutique design hostel movement with many hostels rivaling hotel accommodation.\nFor those looking for something a little different, a  'botel' (boat hotel) may be an appealing option. Usually relatively well placed, with gorgeous views. Most are moored on the south of the river in Praha 4 and 5, but the best is to stay in Prague 1, next to monuments to visit by foot, in the Lesser Town district (Mala Strana) or in the Old Town (Stare Mesto). Prices vary from \u20ac20 to \u20ac120 per person (as of 2010).\nFor specific sleeping suggestions in the popular Old Town neighbourhood, have a look into the dedicated  article.\n\n\nConnect\nPrague has 5G from all Czech carriers. Wifi is widely available in public places.\n\n\nWork\nPrague is probably the best place for foreigners to look for a job because there are many multinational and English speaking companies. It is also easy to get a job teaching English because of a high demand. For more information on working in the Czech Republic, see Czech Republic#Work.\n\n\nStay safe\nPrague is a very safe city. You're less likely to be victim of a serious crime in Prague than in most Western European or US cities. There are no 'no-go zones' and it is safe for women to venture out alone, even in the dead of night.\nThe most common crimes in Prague by far are car theft and pickpocketing; in particular, the prevalence of car theft and vandalism pushes up the crime statistics of Prague. As a party destination, it is common to encounter drunk partygoers, but most of the time the rowdy ones will be fellow tourists; exercise the same caution you would when dealing with any drunk person. The only area with a high concentration of homeless people is in front of the central station.\n\n\nTheft and pickpocketing\nBegging occurs at the city's top tourist attractions and in some of the main public transport hubs. Don't carry a wallet or purse in the back pocket of your pants, always keep an eye on your items, don't put all your money in one place, don't show your money or valuable things to anybody. Understand that the number of 'not truly homeless' professional beggars is high.\nBe aware of teams of pickpockets that lurk outside metro stations, overcrowded trams, Charles Bridge, Wenceslas Square and the Old Town Square. They usually work in teams of 3-5 and look for lost or distracted tourists. Backpacks are especially interesting to them. Many of those groups use underage children as pickpockets because they are not liable according to Czech criminal law.\nDue to the low incidence of violent crime, the threat of pickpockets has been played up as a great problem. However, common sense and basic precautions can keep most people safe from pickpockets. If you have a camera, try not to wear it openly. Always close and secure your backpack and try to keep an eye on it. Be especially careful not to fall asleep in the tram or on the metro. Wear your wallet in a safe place (like inner pocket of your coat), never put it into your rear pocket or any other place where it can be easily stolen.\nBe astute on sleeper trains, as bag robberies are on the increase between major stations. Ask for ID from anyone who asks to take your ticket or passport, and lock backpacks to the luggage racks. Keep valuables on you and maintain common sense.\nIf you enter the metro (usually at night), you may find a team of con artists at the stations, saying that they are metro clerks and, after examining your ticket for some time, that it's invalid so you'll have to pay a fine of 500 K\u010d (1000 K\u010d if you argue with them). So if you happen to see them and you're sure that your ticket is valid, tell them to call the police, or call them yourself. Remember that Prague Metro ticket inspectors have to produce their badge (see here for badge and ID card specimen) in order to check your ticket and issue a fine; if they don't do this as soon as they approach you then, they are almost certainly fakes.\n\n\nDrugs\nPossession of drugs has been historically a grey area under the Czech jurisdiction. Since early 2010, though, the dubious term \"an amount more than small\" has been finally transformed into absolute values based on the actual judicial practice and it is no longer an offense to carry less than 15 g of marijuana, 5 patches of LSD, 1 g of cocaine, etc. It is still a criminal offense to possess more than the allowed amount of drugs. Bear in mind that for possession of lesser amount you might be still fined by public authorities as it is an offense (even though not criminal one).\nYou may encounter public drug consumption such as people smoking marijuana on street corners or in parks. Do not take this as permission to do it yourself. Locals know and understand just how much the city police is willing to tolerate and getting hassled by police because you don't know the 'etiquette' is a reliable way to ruin your holiday.\n\n\nMoney exchanges\nBe careful with money exchanges. Exchange your money in banks or official tourist information centres and avoid exchange offices. Never deal with a street money-dealer; they offer better rates but frequently try to swindle you by giving you money from another country, such as expired Belarusian rubles or old Bulgarian leva.\nMost of the exchange offices are fair, but some, especially at the busiest tourist sites, may try to cheat customers with various tricks:\n\nespecially near the Old Town square, some of them even have rates that are half of the normal\noffering favorable exchange rates, but with fine print below such as if you exchange more than \u20ac1000\nputting a huge board with \"we sell\" exchange rates to the shop window, which makes an impression of good rates, whereas the actual rate for buying koruny is much more unfavorable\nWhen the customer finds this out at the counter and wants to cancel the transaction, the money-dealer refuses with an excuse \"I have already printed the bill\", implying it is too late. This is a lie.\nAlways ask for the exact amount you will be given before accepting an exchange or handing over your money. If after the fact you feel that the transaction was unfair you have 3 hours to request a refund (no reason needs to be provided) which the exchange place is obliged by law to issue. Some places will pretend they don't know about this law, but the receipt they issue to you usually states this requirement in Czech and English. If your lawful refund is still being refused, the legally prescribed way to file a complaint is with the Czech National Bank, but in practice it is often best to find a nearby city police officer (m\u011bstsk\u00e1 policie) and politely ask them to accompany you to the exchange place and assist you in obtaining a refund.\nCredit cards are widely accepted at all supermarkets, hotels and also in most tourist places. As in most countries you can find cards for ATM withdrawals with low or 0% fee and often for payment with Visa or MasterCard exchange rate only (which is same as rate of best exchange offices), there is no need to use exchange offices anymore in 21st century.\n\n\nATMs\nWhile all ATMs (aka cash machines or bankomats) are safe to use, one company stands out for their shady tactics and morally grey business practices. Blue-and-yellow Euronet ATMs will offer abysmal exchange rates, will not carry small bills less than 1000 K\u010d and if you do not make a custom amount selection they will push you towards withdrawing outrageously high amounts such as 10 000 K\u010d. Unfortunately, they're by far most numerous, so using them sometimes cannot be avoided. If you have to use them it is generally best to:\n\nrefuse the offered exchange rate; your bank's exchange rate will be used instead, which is almost always much better\nenter the custom amount you want and ignore the suggested amounts\nunderstand that if you need amounts less than 1000 or 2000 K\u010d any other brand of ATM will generally dispense 200 K\u010d bills\nOr better yet, avoid cash and preferably pay by card.\n\n\nTaxi scams\nTaxi drivers of Prague are a major \"image issue\". While the risk of overcharging is generally overplayed, non-Czech-speaking customers still get ripped off often, in various ways. You can avoid such a situation by following these common-sense rules:\n\nTry to avoid suspicious taxis and when in doubt, walk away and catch another taxi.\nThe most frequent cases of cheating happen between the railway station or airport and hotel, and around the Old Town square.\nIf you are paying significantly more than 500K\u010d for a way from airport to city center, you are being ripped off. Rides within the center rarely surpass 200K\u010d.\nIt is illegal for a taxi driver to refuse you a receipt in Prague.\nEven though you ask for a receipt, the taxi-meter could be tampered with using a so-called \"turbo\" button, which will cause the taxi-meter price to increase much faster than it normally would.\nIf presented with an incorrect bill from a taxi driver, call the police on your mobile phone \u2013 the driver will quickly change his tune.\nTaxi drivers at the railway station may show you a printed card that details the \"fixed fares\" for travel within the city. This is completely false.\nSome hotels offer taxi services. Make sure to compare the price with other companies \u2013 some hotel taxis may be more than twice the normal price, and the car is not even identified as being a taxi.\nAn information desk may be set-up on some taxi stands in the city, with orientation prices to most popular destinations from that stand. But a flaw in the local law allows some of the taxi companies renting the taxi stands (specifically around Old Town square) to charge VERY high prices (about 99 K\u010d/km). The most infamous company in this regard is AAA Taxi s.r.o., deliberately creating its name to resemble regulated and popular AAA Radiotaxi Praha. But they charge four times more for a ride, and even do not provide services to Czech customers.\nIf you are convinced you got overcharged by the taxi driver, mark the car ID numbers (licence plate, taxi licence number on the car door, driver name, etc.) and contact the company which the driver is working for (if any) or police. The scammers are often \"covered\" by underground, so it's hard to deal with it once you pay and the taxi driver is gone. The problem is also that you have to testify against the driver \u2013 which is kind of hard when you're already on the other side of the planet.\nThat being said, number of app-based solutions offer cheaper, easier and more reliable service than traditional taxis without the ability of the driver to charge you an arbitrary amount. Consider using Bolt, Liftago or Uber instead.\n\n\nTrams\nIn Prague, trams always have right of way, even over pedestrians using pedestrian crossings (zebras). A tram will never stop at a crossing for you. They also do not follow the normal traffic lights (they have special system of their own). Trams, being on rails, also have a very long braking distance, even when compared with other vehicles of similar size such as trucks. Trams, obviously, also cannot swerve to avoid hitting you.\nSerious incidents are rare, but be cautious when crossing tram tracks, particularly at large tram intersections.\n\n\nEmergencies\nIf you find yourself in emergency, dial 112. The respondent should be able to respond in English, German, Polish, Russian and French in addition to Czech. You can also use 158 for police, 155 for ambulance or 150 for firefighters but you may not receive a response in languages other than Czech.\nIf you need medication at weekends or evenings, you can go to L\u00e9k\u00e1rna Palack\u00e9ho, (Tel +420 224 946 982) the 24-hour pharmacy on Palack\u00e9ho 5 in the new town or to L\u00e9k\u00e1rna U Svat\u00e9 Ludmily, (Tel: \u260f +420 222 513 396) on Belgick\u00e1 37 (metro station N\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed M\u00edru  A ).\nIf you need non-emergency (but still urgent) medical care outside of normal working hours visit Fakultn\u00ed nemocnice v Motole (Motol University Hospital) which is the biggest and most advanced hospital in the Czech Republic. Main number is \u260f +420 224 431 111 and the hospital is at V \u00davalu 84, Praha 5 ( metro station Nemocnice Motol  A ).\n\n\nRespect\nBecause of Prague's liberal attitude and cheap prices, it's often considered \"the drinking capital of Europe\". This has raised many issues, with tourists being loud and making the center of Prague generally unlivable. This issue has spread to local politics, and it's likely that it will cause many regulations, with great impact on both tourists and party-going locals. Some regulations have already happened. However, it's possible to party in Prague without angering locals too much. To do so, it is often enough to use common sense, but please keep up in mind\u02d0\n\nWhen staying somewhere using AirBnB or similar service, please be mindful of your neighbours. If you are loud, your neighbours might call the police on you \u2013 this will not just cause problems for you, but also for your host. Also, it generally lowers the reputation of AirBnB, and leads to city government imposing restrictions on everyone staying in Prague after you, and might even lead to a complete ban on AirBnB. If you go to Prague to party, it might be worth considering staying in a party hostel (there are many of them) and leave AirBnB to couples and families.\nIf you head to a pub or club, use their smoking room (clubs have them) or just don't smoke outside. If you really need to smoke outside, be quiet (especially after 22:00). Crowds of loud people in front of a club or pub might lead to this place being fined or even closed.\nWhen renting an electric scooter or such vehicle, use designated routes for cyclists or streets. Inconsiderate or illegal use of scooters, such as riding them on sidewalks or pedestrian zones, could lead to them being banned, as happened with Segways after they became popular. Rider may also receive 2000 K\u010d fine.\nFollowing this common sense might reward you. If you are quiet and polite, the police probably won't mind you drinking alcohol on the street or smoking weed openly, even though this is forbidden. If you are not, you'll not just run the risk of the police bothering you, but you might also contribute to Prague losing its liberal attitude.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nLocal foreign language media\nPrague Daily Monitor.
