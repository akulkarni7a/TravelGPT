  "extract": "Colourful and diverse, street food is an experience you can find in cities and towns all around the world. It's generally convenient and cheap, but its appeal goes far beyond that. Street food can be simple yet utterly delicious, and it's often a great way to sample some authentic local cuisine. Joining locals around bustling little street stalls can open doors and lead to memorable encounters. In some countries, whether you're a typical foodie or not, you may find that your search for great street food turned out to be among the best experiences of your trip.\n\n\nUnderstand\nWhile available pretty much anywhere, street food is most commonly associated with hot climates in general and Asian countries in particular.\nThis type of food is sold in urban environments and in, some parts of the world, along highways\u2014in other words, places where people are moving. Markets are a good place to find a range of vendors selling street food, especially in warmer countries. There you can often go from stall to stall sampling hundreds of different kinds of food\u2014spicy, sweet, salty, hot and cold\u2014and a range of drinks.\nIn colder parts of the world street food is less common, usually in the form of single food trucks, carts or kiosks where you can often choose only among variants of the same dish, e.g. hot dogs and sausages with different toppings. There, street food is almost always designed to be eaten by hand and there are seldom designated seats and tables like the ones you would find, e.g. in a Singapore hawker's centre. On the other hand, at market-like events there is usually more to choose from, especially if the event is centered on food!\n\n\nRead and watch\nBooks and documentaries on street food have boomed in the 21st century, reflecting the worldwide craze for authentic food and genuine culinary adventures. Gone are the days when tourists travelling to lesser developed countries would stay confined within 5-star resorts and only eat at the fine dining restaurants. To experience street food is to experience the heart and soul of the city.\n\n\nBooks on street food\nMasterChef: Street Food of the World (2017) by Genevieve Taylor\nThe World Atlas of Street Food (2017) by Sue Quinn and Carol Wilson\n\n\nDocumentaries on street food\nStreet Food premiered on Netflix in April 2019\n\n\nEat\nStreet food is often not limited to just one country or region: for example, hamburgers can be found almost everywhere in the world.

In Sweden a hot dog is called varmkorv (hot sausage) and is a popular street food.

There are bigger markets such as on May Day, the herring markets along the coast once or twice a year, the \"[name of town] day\" in many towns etc., which may have a larger assortment than the weekly markets.\nFour days a year an event called the Restaurant day takes place.

Food that has been handled carelessly can carry bacteria, Hepatitis virus and other things that can upset your stomach and possibly even develop into something worse. You should be careful with food that has been sitting around for a long time. It is best if your food is prepared after you've ordered it and served hot. Generally speaking stalls with a high number of customers in a given time are more likely to serve fresh produce and less likely to have the food lying around too long.\n\n\nRespect\nIt's a good idea to look at how other people eat; otherwise, the food might end up everywhere but in your mouth and/or you will make a spectacle of yourself. The latter would include eating with chopsticks with absolutely no prior experience, eating with your hands when nobody else does or eating with your left hand in Muslim countries where it is considered dirty.",
