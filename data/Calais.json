  "extract": "Calais (Dutch: Kales) is a city of 73,000 people (2019) in the Hauts-de-France region of France. It is the closest point on the European mainland to England; Dover lies across the English Channel (La Manche) just 32 km (20 miles) away. The town has a major cross-Channel ferry port, and the French entrance to the Channel Tunnel is nearby. Calais is popular with British day-trippers arriving by ferry or on Channel Tunnel shuttle trains one reason being because France has lower taxes on alcohol and tobacco.  While most tourists view the town as simply a port, there is much more to Calais.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nLarge warehouse supermarkets have sprung up on the outskirts of Calais just to serve the British \"booze cruisers\" who return to the UK with their car suspensions groaning under the weight of cheap alcohol and cigarettes.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy ferry (car and foot)\nCalais is connected to Dover in England by ferry services operated by P&O Ferries and DFDS Seaways. Ferry crossings between Calais and Dover take typically around 1 hr 30 min and there are up to 46 sailings daily. However, as of March, 2024, only P&O allows foot passengers, and that only twice a day. The check-in time is 30 minutes before departure for vehicles and 90 minutes before departure for foot passengers.\n\nThe strait of Dover is one of the most frequented shipping lanes in the world. Calais ferry port allows easy access to the town and to shops outside the town, many of which are designed to sell alcohol to visitors from the UK where higher taxation means alcohol of all kinds is normally priced higher.\nFree car parking facilities are available in front of the Calais ferry terminal and the maximum stay is three days.\nAnother popular ferry route is Dover to Dunkirk (near Calais) which is operated by DFDS Seaways and takes around 2 hours.\nPassengers travelling by ferry from Dover to Calais/Dunkirk go through French passport/identity card checks in the UK before embarkation, rather than on arrival in France. Passengers travelling in the other direction from Calais/Dunkirk to Dover by ferry go through French exit checks and UK passport/identity card checks in Calais/Dunkirk before embarkation, and UK customs checks on arrival in the UK.\nFares for the Dover-Calais ferry start from \u00a325 (day return) and \u00a339 (single) for a car with up to 9 passengers.\n\n\nBy car\n\n\nEurotunnel Le Shuttle\nRunning from Folkestone to the western edge of Calais (Coquelles), this car shuttle service operated by Eurotunnel takes about 35 min (although only about 20 min in the tunnel) and offers the fastest way to travel between France and the UK. This train service is for passengers with cars only, who remain with their car for the duration of the short trip, as there are no restaurants (except a fast food restaurant) but there are toilets.\nPassengers travelling from Folkestone to Calais go through French passport/identity card checks in the UK before boarding the train, rather than on arrival in France. Those travelling in the other direction from Calais to the UK by Eurotunnel go through UK passport/identity card and customs checks in Coquelles before boarding the train, rather than on arrival in the UK.\n\n\nRoads\nThe port in Calais is directly linked to the French motorway system. The A26/E15, Autoroute des Anglais, which provides access to the heart of France including Paris and beyond and the A16/E40, a gateway to Benelux and the northern European motorway systems. The A16/E402 directs you to western France.\n\n\nBy train\n1 Calais-Fr\u00e9thun station.   \n2 Calais-Ville railway station.   \n\n\nEurostar\n\nEurostar operates high-speed trains between Calais Fr\u00e9thun station and the following destinations in the United Kingdom and Belgium:\n\nLondon St Pancras International station (1 hr 2 min; 3 daily from London; 2-3 daily to London)\nEbbsfleet International station (44 min; 2 daily from Ebbsfleet; 1-2 daily to Ebbsfleet)\nAshford International station (35 min; 1 daily from Ashford)\nBrussels Zuid-Midi station (1 hr 2 min; 2-3 daily from Brussels; 3 daily to Brussels)\nNote that Calais Fr\u00e9thun station is some distance from Calais city centre, but there are a number of trains operating between Calais Fr\u00e9thun and Calais Ville (in the city centre), as well as shuttle buses and taxis.\nThe Eurostar timetable is available from their website.\nPassengers travelling by Eurostar from the UK to Calais go through French passport/identity card checks in the UK before boarding the train, rather than on arrival in France. Passengers travelling in the other direction from Calais to the UK by Eurostar go through French exit checks, followed by UK passport/identity card checks in Calais Fr\u00e9thun station before boarding the train, and UK customs checks on arrival in the UK.\nThose travelling by Eurostar between Brussels and Calais are within the Schengen Area.\nAlthough the Brussels Midi-Calais Fr\u00e9thun route can't be purchased through the Eurostar website, it is available on the Belgian Railways website.\nEurostar fares start from \u00a366 return (under 26) and \u00a369 return (adults) from the UK to Calais.\n\n\nSNCF\nRunning from Lille, Boulogne, Dunkirk and Paris, Calais is well supported by the French national rail network. Calais Ville is the station serving the city centre, whilst Calais Fr\u00e9thun is on the outskirts of Calais. There are trains that operate between Calais Ville and Calais Fr\u00e9thun stations.\n\n\nBy plane\n3 A\u00e9roport de Calais-Dunkerque (CQF  IATA) (in the small town of Marck, 7 km to the east of Calais centre). Just across the narrowest part of the English Channel and near France's western border, with customs available on request, it's a convenient stopping point for light aircraft. Lille is probably the nearest large airport.   \n\n\nGet around\n\nMost people travel by car around the town, but there is a comprehensive network of buses running from the town centre to the suburbs and Cit\u00e9 Europe. The port is served by a special shuttle bus although via a footbridge the centre, and the harbour terminal are only 15 min apart.\nBus 5 is useful for reaching the large Auchan and Carrefour hypermarkets and the Cite Europe shopping mall and the 6 goes to Calais Frethun Eurostar station. Services run every 30 min during the day and costs about \u20ac1 (board through the front door and pay the driver) and all buses terminate outside the Gare D'Ville.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Les Bourgeois de Calais, Place du Soldat Inconnu (outside the town hall).
