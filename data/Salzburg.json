  "extract": "Salzburg is a city in Austria, near the border with Germany's Bavaria state, with a population of 157,000 (2020). It was the setting for the 1965 movie The Sound of Music, so you may think you know all there is to see in Salzburg if you have seen the movie. Admittedly, it is difficult not to burst into song when you're walking along the Salzach River, or climbing up to the Hohensalzburg fortress, which looms over the city. But there is a lot more to this compact, courtly city than Julie Andrews and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was born here.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSalzburg, which has been inhabited since the Neolithic period, is the fourth-largest city in Austria (after Vienna, Graz and Linz) and the capital of the federal state of Salzburg. In 45 AD, it was a Roman establishment. The Bavarians took over in the 6th century. At the end of the 16th century, under Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, the transformation of the medieval town into the \"Rome of the North\" began, with new buildings following the Italian baroque style. The buildings from this era are mostly in the \"Old Town\", as it is known today. The old town is one of the best-preserved city centers in the German-speaking world and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. Salzburg became part of the Austrian Empire in 1816. It frequently ranks favorably in quality of life rankings.\n\n\nOrigins of name\nThe name Salzburg, literally \"Salt Castle\", is derived from the barges carrying salt on the Salzach river, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century.\n\n\nEarly history and medieval period\nTraces of human settlements dating to the Neolithic Age and later a Celt camp have been found in the area. Starting from 15 BC, the small communities were grouped into a single town which was named by the Romans as Juvavum. Little remains of the city from this period.\nThe Hohensalzburg Fortress was built in 1077 and expanded in the following centuries. Independence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century.\n\n\nIndependent state\nSalzburg was the capital of an independent state from the early 14th century until 1805. It was ruled by prince-archbishops, who became rich by the salt mines in the south of the city. This led to the architectural gem you see today, as materials and architects were imported from Italy and other European countries. This is also why, compared to other Austrian cities, sacral monuments surpass the few secular buildings in every respect. The prince-archbishops were forced to give up their political powers during the French occupation in 1805, when Napoleon Bonaparte introduced the concept of separation of Church and State in all the occupied territories.\n\n\nTourist information\nSalzburg tourism website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Salzburg W.A. Mozart International Airport (SZG  IATA), Innsbrucker Bundesstra\u00dfe 95 (about 20 minutes from the centre of the city), \u260f +43 662 8580 7911. Connection with the city is provided by a trolley bus. The airport has direct connections from Rotterdam, Amsterdam Schiphol, Brussels, Birmingham, Coventry, Exeter, London, Palma de Mallorca, Paris, Saint Petersburg, \u0130stanbul, Moscow, Vienna, all big German cities, and Zurich.   (updated Sep 2021)\nHaving arrived at the airport (Flughafen Salzburg), it is very easy to make your way into the town centre by electric trolleybus or other modes of transport. Tickets for these services can be bought easily from the bus driver and you can travel from here to the \"Hauptbahnhof\" main station where you can reach many destinations, predominantly in Austria, but also across the whole of Europe.\nFor more international connections, you may prefer flying to Munich and taking the train to Salzburg. Other airports in Austria like Graz or Innsbruck can be of interest if you like scenic journeys through the mountains.\n\n\nBy train\nSalzburg's train station, the Hauptbahnhof, is north of the Salzach River within the New Town of Salzburg. The train ride from Munich to Salzburg takes about 1\u00bd hours (Regional trains take about 2 hours), and international trains operate from Zurich, Zagreb, Ljubljana and Budapest and other destinations. Inter-city trains operate very frequently (especially to Vienna where services are almost hourly).\nThe \u00d6BB Nightjet runs to Salzburg from Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.\nThe station is operated by the Austrian Federal Railway Company (\u00d6BB) and by the national German Railway company (DB). Both companies have ticket stalls and machines in the station. The popular train pass for Bavaria sold by DB (in German: Bayern Ticket) covers train rides between Bavaria and Salzburg, but it is only valid for Regional trains (code RE, RB, or M). The rail pass can be brought from DB ticket stalls and from DB ticket selling machines in the station.\nSalzburg has direct train connections with Vienna, Linz, Feldkirch (at the Liechtenstein border), Z\u00fcrich (in Switzerland), etc.\nThe station has a supermarket which is open 06:00-23:00, lockers (from \u20ac2 to \u20ac3.50, which are often full), and toilets (\u20ac0.50/entry).\nTo get to the city centre, walk (about 15 min), or use one of the trolley buses.\n\n\nBy bus\nBudweis-shuttle \"http://www.budweis-shuttle.cz\" and Czechshuttle.com offers a door-to-door shuttle bus transfer from \u010cesky Krumlov or \u010ceske Budejovice to Salzburg and back for 1,100 K\u010d per person.\nFrom Bosnia, (Banja Luka or Doboj), three times per week, with Boro Bus\nBus transfer from/to Budapest with a possible stop in Vienna, from door to door, English-speaking drivers with Eurobusways \nThere are day-trip tour buses that leave from Munich (right outside the main station).\nThe Flixbus stop is in Salzburg Sud, not really near the main train station.\n\n\nBy car\nSalzburg is well connected to Vienna (Wien) and Munich (M\u00fcnchen), Germany via the autobahns A8 (Munich - Salzburg) and A1 (Salzburg - Vienna). There is an Austrian Motorway \"Vignette\" you have to purchase. The price varies depending on whether you buy a yearly or 10-day vignette.\nDriving around Salzburg can be a pain. The road names are small and written in a \"traditional\" German font which can be hard to read. The best bet is to get into the city, find a parking space, and travel by foot. Several garages are on the edge of the historic center have hourly rates as well as 24-hour rates that range from \u20ac14-20.  Garage companies include Best in Parking, APCOA, Contipark. Nearby hotels often have arrangements for discounted rates with commercial garages. More budget options include using one of the park-and-ride lots that have promotions for a free transit pass or even free parking during summer months. Be sure that if you are driving in cold weather to be prepared for snow. Snow chains should be recommended, in extreme weather. All cars must have snow tires (Winterreifen) by law from October to April.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe best way to get around Salzburg is by foot.\nThere is a network of city buses, the StadtBus, with numbers from 1 to 10, 12 and 14 (O-Buses, electric, trolley-bus) and 20-27 (fuel-powered). From the bus driver, you only get a single A single ticket for \u20ac3. The other option is buying a 5-ticket-strip in advance (\u20ac11,50). A 24-hr ticket costs \u20ac4.70, when bought at the vending machine (all prices from 2024). There are also daily, weekly and monthly passes. The Salzburg Verkehr application allows you to buy these tickets from your mobile phone. Make sure that you do not catch one of the last buses. They will take you several kilometers out of town with your only way back being by walking or taxi. If you need to get somewhere late at night it may be best to take a taxi or walk. \nThe \"Lokalbahn\" train has a separate train station under the main train station and travels in the direction of Oberndorf and Lamprechtshausen. Tickets can be bought on the train.\nFrom May 2025, overnight guests will pay a mobility contribution of initially 50 cents per day (from May 2027 1.10 \u20ac/day) and can use all public transport in the state of Salzburg free of charge.\nAnother option for exploring areas around the main city (Bad Ischl, Fuschlsee, etc.) are the POST-BUSes. These also leave from the main train station; tickets can be bought from the driver.\nAn excellent option is renting a bike. Salzburg has over 100 km of bike paths, and using this mode of transportation is often faster than bus, car or foot. There are also excellent bike paths on either side of the river which you can follow to either Freilassing (35 min), Oberndorf or Hallein (each about an hour away).\n\n\nSalzburg Card\nDepending on how long you want to stay in Salzburg and how much you want to pack into one day, the Salzburg Card could be a good investment, it includes:\n\nFree single admission to all the city's attractions.\nFree use of public transport throughout the city, including fortress funicular, panorama boat & cable car Untersberg.\nAttractive discounts for cultural events.\nDiscounts for various tours and excursions.\nSalzburg Card 24 hr/adult: \u20ac28.00, 48 hours: \u20ac37.00, 72 hours: \u20ac43.00\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Schloss Hellbrunn, F\u00fcrstenweg 37, \u260f +43 662 820372-0, fax: +43 662 820372-4931, info@hellbrunn.at.
