  "extract": "Versailles is a city on the western edge of the French capital city Paris, now part of the sprawling metropolis within the Ile de France region. Versailles is best known for being the site of the vast royal palace and gardens built by King Louis XIV on what had been the grounds of a royal hunting lodge. It is also one of the wealthiest cities near Paris.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nVersailles served as the de facto seat of government on multiple occasions throughout French history, and acted as a retreat during periods of revolutionary insurrection in Paris, notably during the years of the Paris Commune in which a leftist government was established in Paris itself, forcing the government of the French Third Republic to move to Versailles.\nThe Palace of Versailles, also known as the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, has been the scene for several historic events, not the least of which was the signing, on 28 June 1919 in the Hall of Mirrors, of the Peace Treaty between defeated Germany and the Allies that brought the First World War formally to an end. The signing of the treaty at Versailles, of course, mirrored the proclamation, in 1871 within the same long hall, of the establishment of the German Empire under the Prussian king, subsequently the Kaiser.\nThe palace started out as a simple hunting lodge built by Louis XIII. However, after that Louis XIV decided he wanted to build the palace that we know today at that location. In 1789 the palace lost its seat in power, but today hosts the Museum of France's history.\nThe palace area consists of the main palace, a large garden, an extensive park, as well as a number of annex buildings which all are of historic and cultural interest. Seeing all of this in the pace it deserves, as well as the transport between different sites, take time. If you have only one day to spend at Versailles, make a plan and prioritize what you want to see, and take into account that there are large distances between some of the interesting locations and possibly also lines to wait in at the entrance. Versailles palace is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n\nGet in\nThe easiest way to get to Versailles palace and avoid queues is to buy the ticket directly from the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles website and to book a time entrance for the palace, either with a Palace Ticket or with a Passport Ticket: the former includes an audioguided tour of the Chapel and Opera House, the King's and Queen's State Apartments, the Dauphin's and the Mesdames' Apartments, the latter adds the Trianon palaces and estate, and the Jardins musicaux or Grandes eaux musicales when shown. The Coach Museum is free and the temporary exhibitions are included on the tickets.\nHowever, you can get to the Palace easily by train and buy tickets for each attraction once there.  This may be the best approach if you want to see something in particular or just want to explore the enormous gardens.\n\n\nBy train\nThere are three train stations in Versailles: Versailles Ch\u00e2teau Rive Gauche, Versailles Rive Droite and Versailles Chantiers.  The Versailles Ch\u00e2teau Rive Gauche station is the one closest to the Palace (5-minute walk), though the other two stations are not all that much further away (about a 15-minute walk).\n\nFrom Paris Montparnasse: Take Transilien N or TER Centre-Val de Loire to 1 Versailles Chantiers (\u20ac3.55), the trip will take either 25 minutes (a train every 15 minutes) or 12 minutes (roughly a train every hour), but the walk is not very nice from that station. If your train isn't non-stop, it will call at Viroflay Rive Gauche, where you can change for a line C train to Versailles Chateau Rive Gauche (see below).\nFrom Paris: RER C line, direction Versailles Ch\u00e2teau Rive Gauche (train called VICK or VITY), get off at '2 Versailles Ch\u00e2teau Rive Gauche station (\u20ac3.55). The station is the closest one to the Palace so this makes it the fastest way of reaching the Palace from many locations in central Paris (37 minutes from Saint-Michel - Notre-Dame, 26 minutes from Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel). Be careful not to get off at Viroflay Rive Gauche! The name looks somewhat the same, but it is not the right station! The RER C7, direction Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, stops at Versailles Chantiers (train called SARA or SLOM). Do not take RER C terminating at Versailles-Chantiers (train called CIME or CITY) as this takes a long tour of the southern suburbs of Paris before reaching Versailles.\nFrom Paris Saint Lazare: Take Transilien L to 3 Versailles Rive Droite (\u20ac4.35). You will reach Versailles in 33 minutes, with the opportunity to see (or visit) La D\u00e9fense on the way. The walk from that station can be very pleasant.\nVersailles is in public transport zone 4, so all passes (Navigo, Mobilis, Paris Visite, Ticket jeune...) that include zone 4 are valid. A ticket t+ is not valid for the train, you need to purchase a specific ticket. However, you can use the train ticket from Paris for a metro or RER (but not a bus or tram) ride in Paris to reach the train, and similarly in the other direction.\n\n\nBy bus\nRoute 171 travels between Pont de S\u00e8vres (at the end of M\u00e9tro line 9) to Versailles. The bus journey from the station to the ch\u00e2teau takes approximately 30 min. This is slightly cheaper than the train, but slower. You can use a ticket t+ (ordinary m\u00e9tro/bus ticket) on the bus, but you need to use a separate ticket for the bus and for the m\u00e9tro.\n\n\nBy bike\nIt's a nice bike ride from Paris via Bois de Boulogne and Parc St Cloud. [1] It's a bit tiring to combine with a Palace visit though (45 km with a few hills).\n\n\nGet around\n\n \n \nThe main city is easily traversable on foot, however a good network of buses run throughout. Tickets t+ (the same tickets as for Paris buses and m\u00e9tro) are valid on Versailles city buses.\nOnce inside the palace it's possible to hire bikes and battery-powered golf carts (see section below).\n\n\nSee\n\n\nCh\u00e2teau de Versailles\n\n1 Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. Nov-Mar: Tu-Su 09:00-1730, Apr-Oct: Tu-Su 09:00-18:30; closed Jan 1, May 1 and Dec 25. Normal pass - \u20ac20, \u20ac27 including Musical Fountain Shows or Gardens; Two-day pass - \u20ac25/\u20ac30; Palace-only tickets: \u20ac18; Trianon-only tickets: \u20ac12; The Palace and Trianon are free for under-18s, EU residents under 26, teachers and disabled people and one accompanying person..   (updated Jan 2018)\nCheck temporary closures [2] as some rooms may occasionally be closed, either for renovation or to accommodate state functions (the palace is sometimes used to host visits of foreign dignitaries or joint meetings of the National Assembly and the Senate).\nAnother famous \"must see\" location on the western outskirts of Paris. Not only does it have enormous historical significance but also it is a very beautiful building. Do other tourists a favour: do not use your mobile phones inside as it ruins the atmosphere. Selfie sticks are prohibited inside the palace. Some parts of the palace are usually partially covered by scaffoldings due to the constant maintaining works in progress.\nSince June 2020, a booking is mandatory to enter the palace - even if you have Museum pass or benefit from free entrance (under 26 (EU only), under 18 (everywhere else), or with an EU student visa over 6 months). Slots can be booked online or on spot, and guarantee an entrance within 30 minutes from the entrance slot booked. Book early to be sure to entrance the palace on the time you want. Missing the booked time does not necessarily mean losing your money, as the personnel at the ticket office will try to allow you to entrer later in the day, provided there are still slots available.\nThere is no time slot to visit the gardens, park and Trianon, so you may choose to visit one of these spots and the palace on a different order.\nAs a result, the long lines meandering over the entire square in front of the entrance do not exist anymore.\n\nAlternatively, especially if you have young children, access to the grounds is free.\nNote that it is often free to access the park from the Rue de la Paroisse entrance (leads to the Bassin de Neptune), or if you are walking, from the Boulevard de la Reine (next to the four-star hotel Trianon Palace).\nIf you are travelling with children then beware that you are not allowed to bring the baby trolley inside the palace. However, there are plenty of chairs around the palace that can be used to have a rest.\nOther attractions on the palace grounds include:\n\n2 The Chapelle Royale. A Palestine Chapel that contains a royal gallery dedicated to St. Louis. It was finished in 1707 by Robert de Cotte. The intricate detailing of the chapel's ceiling contains paintings by the artists Jouvet, Coypel, and La Fosse. Van Cleve sculpted the front altar out of marble which is decorated in front with gilded bronze.   \n3 Appartement de la Reine (Queen's Apartment). This suite Washington built for Louis XIV's wife Marie-Therese. The original decoration was redone between 1729 and 1735 with renowned white and gold woodwork. It features several famous rooms including a battle gallery room, a coronation room, and the royal birthing room. Tourists are always welcome to tour through the house and gaze at the spectacles of each room.   (updated Jan 2018)\n4 The Grandes Eaux Musicales. A beautiful garden composed mostly of fountains. The largest of them was built in the 17th century and is called 5 Bassin de Neptune or Neptune's Fountains. These consist of 99 individual fountains. Also in the garden is the 6 Bassin d'Apollon  or Apollo's Fountain. For visitors looking for a gorgeous eye catching experience, they should definitely visit this lovely location. \n7 Potager du Roi, Avenue du Mar\u00e9chal Joffre.. A garden where the king used to have his vegetables cultivated.   \n8  The Grand Trianon Castle (In the northwestern part of the Domain of Versailles.). Louis XIV requested that it be built as a retreat for the king or as a place for the king and his guests to dine without the strict etiquette of the court. Today, it houses visiting foreign dignitaries. It is renowned for its Italian architecture, pink marble, and geometrical french-style gardens. All visitors who come to see the Trianon leave in awe of the beautifully designed castle.   \n9 The Temple of Love. A nice sight to stop by. The temple was built in 1778 in the middle of a small island in The Parc. In the center of this circular temple is a replica Bouchardon statue. The original can be found in The Louvre Museum. It is an especially popular sight for couples who often enjoy sharing a kiss at the center of the temple.   \n10 Hameau de la Reine (The Queen's hamlet). A rustic retreat, which served as a private meeting place for the Queen and her closest friends, a place of leisure. The style of the place is completely different to the royal Versailles, it was fashionable among the French aristocracy at the time. It makes for a pleasant interruption from the grand buildings.   (updated Jan 2018)\n11 Hall of Mirrors. Of one of the most emblematic royal rooms, this Baroque-style gallery has been the scene of significant historical events, including where Otto von Bismarck proclaimed the first German Empire.   \nIf you are in Versailles between the beginning of August to late September, you may have the opportunity to view a show put on at 21:30 by the French government. The show includes fantastical fireworks, classical music, and about 200 people dressed in period costume.\n\n\nOthers\nHistoric buildings are scattered in the west part of the town. See for instance:\n\n12 H\u00f4tel de Ville. A 19th-century town hall building (you can get inside), on the Avenue de Paris, a 5-min walk from the Ch\u00e2teau, or from the Versailles-Rive-Gauche station .  \n13 H\u00f4tel de la P\u00e9fecture. A nice fa\u00e7ade across the town hall.   \n14 Royal Stables (Academy of Equestrian Arts). If you plan to go at the right time, you can even get into a royal horse show. Not only will you get the opportunity to see horses who have been trained by the best of the best perform, but you will also have the chance to see the fascinating royal stables. This is a sight many children often enjoy.   \n15 The Coach Gallery. A display of several coaches, sedans, and sleds used by 19th century monarchs and presidents of France. Free.   (updated Jul 2018)\n16  Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Louis (In the old Quartier Saint-Louis neighbourhood.).   \n17 The Royal Tennis Court (Salle du Jeu de Paume). Site of the Tennis Court Oath, a pivotal event during the beginning of the French Revolution  (updated Jul 2018)\n18 The municipal library. In the former Louis XIV's ministry of foreign affairs, 5 rue de l'Ind\u00e9pendance Am\u00e9ricaine. You can enter on opening hours. They also organise open-doors on certain days, to get a glimpse inside the old cabinets.  \n19 \u00c9glise Notre-Dame, rue de la Paroisse.   \n20 The Musee Lambinet (Just north of the chateau.). It is housed in a beautiful 18th century home and displays many 18th century furnishings such as ceramics, sculptures, paintings, furniture, and other objects that are a part of Versailles' history, some of which are from the revolutionary period. People who appreciate fine arts and history will definitely want to make this a stop during their trip. Text only in French.   \n21 Domaine de Madame \u00c9lisabeth. A park surrounding the country retreat of Princess Elisabeth   (updated Jul 2018)\n22 Paroisse Saint Symphorien de Versailles. Take a trip to this quaint and beautifully constructed chapel, dedicated to Saint Symphorien. It is a landmark in history dating all the way back to 560. In 1722 a monk requested the expansion of the chapel believing it was far too small to hold services and his request was answered years later under the order of Louis XV. This chapel contains classic and gorgeous architecture as well as beautiful historical paintings. Any one who travel to this chapel can not help but to fall in love with the cascading decor.  \n23 Arboretum de Ch\u00e8vreloup. Contains over 2500 species of trees.   (updated Jul 2018)\n\n\nDo\n\nConsider taking an audioguide tour of the ch\u00e2teau, available in several languages from various reception points within the palace and grounds. The day pass price includes the audio tour.\nWithin the grounds in the Summer there are a number of activities including a train ride, rowing boat and cycle hire. The mini-train is really the only time efficient way to get an overview of the entire grounds, which include his and hers residence palaces, which otherwise are at least a 30-minute walk each way from the main palace.  The mini-train also stops along the 24 Grand Canal , where there is a cafe and a snack shop.  For \u20ac30 it is also possible to hire a golf-style buggy for one hour in order to explore the expansive grounds.\nConsider taking a guided tour of Versailles that will allow you to bypass the regular entrance line and visit the palace and grounds with your own guide.  There are several companies that are known for their Versailles Tours, departing from Paris: Aeon Tours of Paris, Oui Paris Tours, Classic Walks , and Gray Line. If you prefer to go by train (RER C) to Versailles, you will find just outside the railway station Versailles Rive Gauche a local company called Guidatours that offers either entrance tickets or guided tours of the Palace of Versailles at very attractive rates: [3]\nAdditionally, a short walk into town can provide a welcome contrast to the hectic, tourist-filled ch\u00e2teau. The town is like most others in France, with a couple of small, historic churches and lined with small shops. While eating on the grounds of the ch\u00e2teau can save time and walking, finding food at a small caf\u00e9, patisserie, or sandwich shop in the town is less expensive and an authentic experience. Eating a picnic along the lake at the ch\u00e2teau is a pleasant experience, and you can find a couple of small grocery stores in town to pick up things like bread, sandwich meat, cheese, wine, etc. to take back for a picnic at the ch\u00e2teau.\nLook into taking a private tour around the city. There are websites that provide information on tour companies that will provide tourists with personal tours and introduce them first hand to the beauty and culture Versailles has to offer.\nLook into taking a private scooter tour from Paris to Versailles for a guided tour of the castle and to ride inside the park (2 Wheel Tours).\nShopping is one way to spend some of your time visiting Versailles. The Palace of Versailles contains its own giftshop as well as other souvenir shops outside the Palace. If you're looking for shopping other than souvenir scavenging there are several shops located around the city centre. Most of these shops are located along the Boulevard de La Reine, the Rue Chantiers, Rue Mar Foch, and the Rue Mar Joffre.\nIf you are looking for a relaxing time, you can head down to the Cinema Cyrano. It offers patrons showings of films, motion pictures, events. This is a great place to go for everyone whether you are travelling alone, or with the family. It offers tickets at a good price including discounts for students, seniors, and happy hour.\n\n\nEat\nVersailles (the town) has any number of good places to eat whilst visiting. Once you have made it into the palace grounds, however, it is far more convenient to eat there \u2014 the alternative is to hike back into the town, before returning to the Palace (time better spent viewing the rooms and grounds). The grounds are also perfect for picnicking in warm and/or dry weather.\nA number of other options exist:\n\nIn the Ch\u00e2teau, there is a Ore restaurant (managed by Alain Ducasse) on the 1st floor (access on the Royal Courtyard), an Angelina restaurant close to the Battles Gallery, on the 1st floor, and a cheaper Grand Caf\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans is on the ground floor not far from the Royal Courtyard.\nWithin the formal gardens, there are 2 informal restaurants, La Flottille and La Petite Venise, on Petite Venise (from the Ch\u00e2teau, head back directly through the gardens to the start of the canal - Petite Venise and the restaurants can then be found to the right).\nSeveral kiosks serving snacks and fast food can be found in the gardens (Bosquet du Dauphin & Bosquet de la Girandole) and an Angelina Terrace near the Petit Trianon.\nThere are also restaurants outside of the palace that are also enjoyable such as:\n\nMonument Caf\u00e9, a new innovative restaurant where you'll find excellent all-you-can-eat buffets (brunch, cold dishes, hot French specialities, desserts) in an atmosphere that will show you a virtual visit of Versailles, with high tech tools. They also organize guided tours and wine tastings.\nA wonderfully quaint bistro called Le Resto du Roy. (Closed) Here one can find many delicacies commonly found in France. However, don't be afraid, the chef also makes more commonly recognizable dishes such as scallops or salmon.\nThere are many bakeries (boulangerie) throughout the city. During lunch hours many bakeries in the town center operate a fast food service to allow customers the ability to get in and out during which people can get already prepared foods such as pizza and sandwiches. If you're looking for a quick and easy lunch, this is definitely a good spot.\n1 Place du March\u00e9 Notre Dame. Place du March\u00e9 Notre Dame (the main market square): If you're looking for more of an authentic French experience, the Place du March\u00e9 is a wonderful option. It is an outdoor market that offers only the freshest foods one can find. Here you can find vegetables, pizzas, fish, meats, fruits, and cheese. The outdoor market operates on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday mornings and starts winding down around 13:00. Sunday is the busiest day here. There are also sit-down restaurants in the market.  \nThe Broadway Caf\u00e9 is also known as the American Caf\u00e9 because it is decorated with stars and stripes. The Broadway Caf\u00e9 offers a variety of foods many of which are more common to American tourists. It offers foods such as burgers, lasagna, pizza, and sandwiches. This is a great place to go if you're looking for an easy, relaxed atmosphere.\n\n\nDrink\nVersailles  might not be the best town in which to party. However it is fairly easy to mix with the locals.\nThere is a little concentration of bars (and restaurants) on the Place du March\u00e9 (at the junction of the Rue de la Paroisse, and Rue du Mar\u00e9chal Foch). This is where most young people go out at night. Tables outside the terraces are plentiful in the nice months. Exploring the walking alleys from the Place du March\u00e9 can also reveal less know restaurants.\nAnother popular bar with Versailles' youth is the O'Paris, on the Avenue de Saint-Cloud, very close to the Ch\u00e2teau's Place d'Armes (on the right-hand side when facing the Ch\u00e2teau). They often play sport events inside. Tables outside are also available when it is warm enough.\n\n\nSleep\n\n Huttopia Versailles. A nice place to stay, in the forest and very close to the RER (train) station. This campsite has a swimming-pool. Many accommodations to rent (cottages, ridge tents.).
