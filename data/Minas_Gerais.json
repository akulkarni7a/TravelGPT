  "extract": "Minas Gerais is a state in Brazil's Southeast region. Minas Gerais is a large state with a valuable 18th-century cultural heritage, originated in the Brazilian gold mining era. The state has also a nationwide popular cuisine, and beautiful landscapes in the Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra da Canastra mountain ranges.\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n1 Belo Horizonte \u2014 the state's capital, a cultural and economic metropolis\n2 Diamantina \u2014 famous for its diamonds, its music and 18th century architecture\n3 Governador Valadares \u2014 a modern city known as the \"little America\" of Brazil\n4 Juiz de Fora \u2014 an industrial and university center between Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, hosts an important festival of Baroque music\n5 Montes Claros \u2014 cultural hub of the north\n6 Ouro Preto \u2014 the most important Brazilian ensemble of Baroque architecture, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site\n7 Sete Lagoas \u2014 a city built amongst seven lakes\n8 Uberaba \u2014 the cattle ranching capital of Brazil\n9 Uberl\u00e2ndia \u2014 humorously referred to as \"Land of Uber\", a very modern cosmopolitan city, the second largest city in the state\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Cara\u00e7a \u2014 a park near Mariana with trails for exploring its waterfalls, rivers, lakes and caves\n2 Serra da Canastra National Park \u2014 known for its numerous waterfalls, diverse wildlife and for being a haven for the endangered Brazilian Merganser\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nMinas Gerais was the seedbed of the Brazilian revolution. Inspired by the American and French revolutions, a group of Mineiros, led by Joaquim Jos\u00e9 da Silva Xavier, nicknamed Tiradentes because he was a dentist, tried to break free from Portuguese rule, but was suppressed. The motto of Minas is Libertas quae sera tamen (Liberty, though it be delayed).\n\"Minas Gerais\" means \"General Mines\", so called because of the various mines in the area. Some still operate; in February 2006 a ring of diamond smugglers, passing off diamonds from Minas as if they were South African, was broken up.\n\n\nElectricity\nElectricity in Minas Gerais is 110 V 60 Hz, but there may be 220 V outlets, so ask. Plugs have two round prongs about 2 cm apart, but outlets that also handle US plugs are common in places frequented by tourists, such as hotels and LAN houses.\n\n\nTalk\nMineiros speak Portuguese like other Brazilians, but, for some, the mineiro accent can be difficult to understand.  Middle-class young people usually speak at least some English. Spanish on the other hand is spoken by almost nobody, even in the capital. Some expressions are often linked to the concept of the mineiro accent. Examples:\n\nuai - used liberally as a form of emphasis, often at the end of sentences. It sounds like the English word why, but is basically meaningless and can be ignored. It is also equivalent to u\u00e9 (less mineiro) and can be replaced for ora (more formal).\ntrem - locals use the word for train to mean thing or stuff, as in \"Me passa aquele trem ali\" (\"Pass me that thing over there\").\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nMajor airports serving the state are located in Belo Horizonte, Juiz de Fora and Uberl\u00e2ndia.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\nTrail of Tiradentes - The cobblestone streets of quaint mountain towns such as Congonhas, Ouro Branco, Ouro Preto, Mariana, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei and Tiradentes hold a great deal of colonial history, largely untouched by time. Grand churches, government buildings, and noble residences abound, their histories entwined with the local gold rush, slavery, and the  Inconfid\u00eancia Mineira, an important early attempt to break free from colonial rule. Many area churches bear the mark of famous architects and artists such as Aleijadinho.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nEat\nMinas' traditional cuisine is unique but was mainly influenced by the Portuguese. Minas prides itself on its food, and comida mineira restaurants can be found throughout the country.\n\nAngu - A hearty side-dish similar to polenta, with sausage and collard greens, and sometimes other meats or vegetables.\nBolinho de mandioca - Fritters made of mandioca, potato, and egg.\nFeij\u00e3o tropeiro - One of the most typical dishes, consisting of brown beans cooked with pork rinds, eggs, garlic, onion, mandioca flours, and other ingredients.\nFrango com quiabo - Chicken and okra, heavily tempered with garlic, onion, and tomato. Served over rice.\nQueijo mineiro - A white table cheese, popular throughout the country.\nQuibebe - Mashed squash with onions and seasoning.\nDoces Gourmet - sugar candy in the sugar tail\n\n\nDrink\nMinas is home to various producers of (the finest, as some might say) cacha\u00e7a, a very strong drink, often found on recipes for caipirinha cocktails.\nIts capital, Belo Horizonte, is said to be the \"alcoholics' paradise\", with more than ten thousand bars and restaurants.\n\n\nStay safe\nMost big cities have chronic safety problems, which may or may not affect visitors. Some tips to help you: \n\nDress simply, without flaunting expensive clothes or jewellery.\nGive preference to going out with a mate.\nIf you are being robbed, do not resist.\n\n\nGo next\nEsp\u00edrito Santo \u2014 Although off-the-beaten path, the state east of Minas Gerais has much to offer tourists. The capital Vit\u00f3ria's beautiful bay and bridge; Vila Velha's Convento da Penha (a 16th-century hilltop Franciscan convent); Guarapari's beaches and summer parties; the German-colonized town of Domingos Martins; Pedra Azul State Park's beautiful blue rock; and Ita\u00fanas's dunes and forr\u00f3 (a Northeastern Brazilian dance); are some of the main attractions that should guarantee tourists a good time.",
