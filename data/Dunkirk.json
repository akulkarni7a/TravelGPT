  "extract": "Dunkirk (French: Dunkerque, Dutch: Duinkerke) is a town in the region of Hauts-de-France in France. The town is a historic resort, 10 km from the border with Belgium. If you're coming from the UK, it's a great place to start your journey further into the Continent, but also a great holiday destination on its own, featuring historic beaches, shopping locations, and many places to eat local food, which is an interesting fusion of traditional Flemish cooking and seafood. It is famous as the site of the Dunkirk Evacuation during World War II, when, over eight days, a fleet of British, Canadian and French Navy and a huge assortment of civilian vessels \u2014 900 boats in all \u2014 evacuated 338,000 British and French soldiers who had been encircled on land by German armies.\n\n\nUnderstand\nThe name Dunkirk comes from the Dutch language \"Church of the Dunes\".\nDunkirk has the third-largest harbour in France, after those of Le Havre and Marseille. As an industrial city, it depends heavily on the steel, food processing, oil-refining, ship-building and chemical industries.\n\n\nHistory\nA fishing village arose late in the 10th century. About AD 960, Count Baldwin III had a town wall erected in order to protect the settlement against Viking raids. The surrounding wetlands were drained and cultivated by the monks of nearby Bergues Abbey.\nIn the 14th century, trade flourished and the port and fortifications were significantly enlarged. In 1482, Dunkirk, along with the rest of Flanders, was incorporated into the Netherlands.\nThe area remained much disputed between Spain, the Netherlands, England and France. It was ruled by each of these countries through the early 17th century, becoming a part of France in 1662. The French government developed the town as a fortified port. The town's existing defences were adapted to create ten bastions. The port was expanded in the 1670s by the construction of a basin that could hold up to thirty warships with a double lock system to maintain water levels at low tide. The basin was linked to the sea by a channel dug through coastal sandbanks secured by two jetties.\nIn World War I, the city experienced severe bombardment. On a regular basis, heavy shells weighing approximately 750 kg were fired from Koekelare, about 45\u201350 km away.\nIn World War II, the Allied expeditionary force was surrounded in Dunkirk in 1940. 338,000 soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk to England in Operation Dynamo. The operation has been depicted in several motion pictures, including Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk. The withdrawal, which was militarily a defeat, was seen as a miraculous saving of soldiers whom the British public had thought lost to capture or killing and gave a much needed morale boost. British politicians still like to invoke the \"Dunkirk spirit\" in times of national crisis.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy boat\nUp to 12 DFDS Seaways car ferries per day cross the sea from Dover (England). The ferry service does not accept passengers on foot, but does accept cyclists. The port of Calais, which receives even more regular crossings from Dover and does take foot passengers, is about 50 km (31 mi) by road or rail from Dunkirk.\n\n\nBy train\nSNCF high-speed trains (TGV) serve Dunkirk from Lille (Europe), Lens, Arras and Paris (Nord). Local trains operated by TER Hauts-de-France come in from nearby towns such as Calais (Ville).\n\n\nBy road\nDunkirk is served by two motorways. The A16 comes up from Amiens, Boulogne-sur-Mer, the Channel Tunnel and Calais, passing Dunkirk and continuing across the Belgian border as the E40 towards Ostend, Bruges, Ghent and Brussels. The A25 comes from Lille, where it connects with the A1 from Arras and Paris\n\n\nBy plane\nThe closest airport receiving scheduled flights is 1 Ostend-Bruges International Airport (OST IATA), which primarily caters for locals travelling to resorts in southern Europe. It is around 60 km (37 mi) to the east near Ostend, Belgium. Due to the Schengen Agreement there is no passport control when crossing from Belgium to France. \nFor more information on nearby airports, consult the Hauts-de-France and Flanders articles.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe public buses are free of charge since September 2018.\n\n\nSee\n1 Port Museum (Mus\u00e9e Portuaire), 9 Quai de la Citadelle, \u260f +33 3 28 63 33 39.

The heart of the carnival is around Ash Wednesday, which occurs in February or March, seven weeks before Easter. Before this, there are les Trois Joyeuses (the Three Joyfuls): Sunday in Dunkirk, Monday in the citadel and Tuesday in Rosenda\u00ebl. The next Sunday, it's Malo.\nFor 2\u00bd months, there is a happy, family-friendly atmosphere. Every Saturday night there is a grand ball. Bands and orchestras play in the streets every Sunday afternoon. On Shrove Tuesday, there are huge colourful parades. A 60-member orchestra dressed as fishermen leads revellers and big wicker mannequins in front of the City Hall, and people gather in the square to receive herrings: almost 450 kg of wrapped, smoked herrings are thrown down from the balcony for the occasion.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\nThe cuisine of Dunkirk closely resembles Flemish cuisine; perhaps one of the best known dishes is coq \u00e0 la bi\u00e8re \u2013 chicken in a creamy beer sauce. Another typical dish is the Potjevleesch, a dish of white meat (veal, pork, rabbit, chicken) cooked and preserved in jelly flavoured with juniper berries.\n\n\nBudget\nAll these are in the city centre:\n\n1 Fresh Burritos Dunkerque, 14 ter Rue de l'Amiral Ronarc'h.
