It is 75 km northeast of Toulouse.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nAlbi is probably best-known as the birthplace of the painter and illustrator, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

This beautiful and impressive fortified cathedral was designed to express a renewal in orthodox Catholicism after the Cathar heresy, which had been centred in the area and whose bloody suppression by the Inquisition was largely complete at the time construction began in  1287. The edifice is primarily a brick Gothic construction, but there is a door by Dominique de Florence (Dominick of Florence) and there are also Italian Renaissance frescoes on the ceiling. Its organ dates from the 18th century.   (updated Nov 2020)\n2 The Berbie Palace (Palais de la Berbie), 4 Rue de la Temporalit\u00e9.
