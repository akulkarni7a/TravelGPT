  "extract": "F\u00fcssen in Allg\u00e4u is an enchanting town in the south of Bavaria, Germany known for the Hohes Schloss and its Basilica and former Benedictine monastery of St Mang.  The world famous Neuschwanstein Castle is situated a few kilometres to the east. Some visitors come to tour the castles and leave immediately afterwards leaving the beautiful little town unexplored.  This is a great pity as there is much to see in F\u00fcssen and the surrounding area if you know what you are looking for! There are magnificent lakes with beautiful views and the \"Kalvarienberg\" which has the \"Stations of the Cross\" on it.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\n1 F\u00fcssen station.   (updated Aug 2022)\nFrom Munich, direct trains leave about every two hours and take two hours. There are more frequent connections if you are prepared to change trains somewhere along the way.\nFrom Innsbruck, head to Vils in Tirol (a small town 7 km from F\u00fcssen), Ulrichsbr\u00fccke-F\u00fcssen (the stop before Vils) or Reutte in Tirol. Bus 74 runs from Reutte to F\u00fcssen via all these stations. Bus 71 runs from Vils directly to the castles. Innsbruck to F\u00fcssen takes about 3 hours.\n\n\nBy car\nF\u00fcssen is on the end of the Romantic Road, coming from Augsburg as Bundesstra\u00dfe 17 (B 17). From Munich take the Autobahn A 96, leave at Landsberg Ost and follow the B 17. If you come from the north via Autobahn A7, take the last exit before the Austrain border.\n\n\nBy bus\nMaybe the cheapest way to get there: Many bus tours are operated to F\u00fcssen from most parts of southern Bavaria, often including a visit of the fairy-tale castle Neuschwanstein. Watch for tours at Munich main station (Hauptbahnhof).\n\n\nGet around\n\nF\u00fcssen is small enough that a car is not really needed. There is a bus to the castles and the trains to Munich and Augsburg and the old town is easy enough to access by foot. You can walk to Neuschwanstein and Hochschwangau castles via some marked roads; travel times posted on the signboards are comfortable over-estimates.\nThere are some great areas nearby, like some of the lesser-known castles, which would be easier to reach with your own car. It is possible to rent a car in F\u00fcssen.\nAnother alternative is to rent a mountain bike. There are numerous shops, one even right at the train station. F\u00fcssen has invested a lot into developing a network of bike routes and paths to make biking easier.\n\n\nSee\n\n\nIn the town\nF\u00fcssen has a compact but well-preserved pedestrianized Old Town (Altstadt) that's well worth a wander.  The skyline is dominated by the Hohes Schloss (High Castle), the former summer residence of the prince-bishops of Augsburg.\n\nThe State Gallery in the Hohes Schloss (Staatsgalerie und St\u00e4dtische Gem\u00e4ldegalerie im Hohen Schloss)\n1 St. Mang's Abbey (Benediktinerkloster St. Mang).
