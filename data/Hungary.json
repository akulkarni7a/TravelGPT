  "extract": "Hungary (Hungarian: Magyarorsz\u00e1g) is a small landlocked country in the south-eastern region of Central Europe. It features a gorgeous capital city, Budapest, and the largest lake in Central Europe, Balaton. Hungary offers many diverse destinations: relatively low mountains in the north-west, the Great Plain in the east, lakes and rivers of all sorts, and many beautiful small villages and hidden gems of cities. Top this off with Hungary's great accessibility in the middle of Europe, a vivid culture and economy, and you get a destination absolutely worth visiting if you're in the region.\n\n\nRegions\n\n\nCities\n1 Budapest \u2014 with green filled parks, interesting museums, and a pulsating nightlife, Budapest is one of Europe's most delightful and enjoyable cities\n2 Debrecen \u2014 the second largest city in the country\n3 Gy\u0151r \u2014 there are many caf\u00e9s, restaurants, boutiques, and night clubs in its lovely baroque city center\n4 Kecskem\u00e9t \u2014 a town famous for its vibrant music scene, plum brandy, and Art Nouveau architecture\n5 Miskolc \u2014 with the unique cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca, the third largest city in the country, located near the B\u00fckk hills\n6 Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za \u2014 a medium-sized city with a busy water resort, museum village, and annual autumn festival\n7 P\u00e9cs \u2014 a pleasant cultural centre and university town\n8 Szeged \u2014 the sunniest city in Hungary\n9 Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r \u2014 former royal seat, famous for its baroque architecture and museums\n\n\nOther destinations\n1 Lake Balaton \u2014 the major lake of Hungary and the biggest lake in Central Europe\n2 Hortob\u00e1gy National Park \u2014 Hungary's largest protected area and the largest semi-natural grassland in Europe\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nSee also: Austro-Hungarian Empire\n\nHungary is one of the 15 most popular tourist destinations in the world, with a capital regarded as one of the most beautiful in the world. Despite its relatively small size, Hungary is home to numerous World Heritage Sites, UNESCO Biosphere reserves, the second largest thermal lake in the world (Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz), the largest lake in Central Europe (Lake Balaton), and the largest natural grassland in Europe (Hortob\u00e1gy). In terms of buildings, Hungary is home to the largest synagogue in Europe (the Great Synagogue of Budapest), the largest medicinal bath in Europe (Sz\u00e9chenyi Medicinal Bath), the third largest church in Europe (Esztergom Basilica), the second largest territorial abbey in the world (Pannonhalma Archabbey), the second largest Baroque castle in the world (G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151), and the largest Early Christian Necropolis outside Italy (P\u00e9cs).\nYou can expect to find safe food and water, good safety and a generally stable political climate.\nHungary has been ethnically diverse since its inception, and while today over 90% of the population are ethnically Hungarian, pockets of ethnic and cultural Slovaks, Romanians, Germans, Romani/Sinti people (Gypsies), and others dot the country. Due to the border changes of Hungary after World War I, over 2 million ethnic and cultural Hungarians live in bordering countries, as well. The Hungarians, otherwise known as Magyars, are the descendants of several tribes from Central Asia, who were believed to be fierce, nomadic horsemen and came to Central Europe in the 9th century.\nRoman Catholicism is the traditional religion of the Hungarian people, but modern Hungary is largely a secular society, and less than 20% of Hungarians attend church regularly.\n\n\nPolitics\nHungary is governed by a right-wing conservative party that is accused of authoritarian behaviour, and the country's status was declared to be no longer a full democracy but an electoral autocracy by resolution of the EU parliament in Sep 2022. This is unlikely to affect travellers who refrain from political activity and do not run afoul of the law. There are also reports of general anti-foreigner sentiment and racism against people who look ethnically non-European, however, Hungary seems to lie within the average of the former Eastern Bloc in that regard.\n\n\nClimate\nTemperatures in Hungary vary from -20\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C through the year. Distribution and frequency of rainfall are unpredictable due to the continental climate of the country. Heavy storms are frequent after hot summer days, and so do more days long still rainfalls in the autumn. The western part of the country usually receives more rain than the eastern part, and severe droughts may occur in summertime. Weather conditions in the Great Plain can be especially harsh, with hot summers, cold winters, and scant rainfall.\n\n\nHolidays\n1 January - New Year's Day\n15 March - National Day (commemorating the 1848 Hungarian revolution and independence war against the Austrian Empire)\nmoveable - Good Friday\nmoveable - Easter\n1 May - International Worker's Day\nmoveable - Pentecost\n20 August - State Foundation Day (also known as St. Stephen's Day)\n23 October - National Day (also known as Republic Day)\n1 November - All Saints Day\n25-26 December - Christmas\n\n\nVisitor information\nVisit Hungary\n\n\nTalk\nSee also: Hungarian phrasebook\n\nHungarians are rightly proud of their unique, complex, sophisticated, richly expressive language, Hungarian (Magyar pronounced \"mohdyohr\"). It is a Uralic language most closely related to Mansi and Khanty of western Siberia. It is further sub-classified into the Finno-Ugric languages which include Finnish and Estonian; it is not at all related to any of its neighbours: the Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages belonging to the Indo-European language family. \nAlthough Hungarian is related to Finnish and Estonian, it is not mutually intelligible with either of them. While there are some similarities in the vocabulary, the complicated grammar and pronunciation make it one of the most challenging languages for English speakers to learn. However, modern Hungarian is written in the Latin alphabet, which eliminates the need for English speakers to learn a new script.\nEnglish is a mandatory subject in schools in Hungary. However, most Hungarians are not fluent in the language, and their level of proficiency is lower than that of many other European countries. Younger generations and people living in Budapest may be able to hold a decent conversation in English but don't expect the same from people in rural areas. It's best not to expect people to speak English at all in rural parts of the country.\nGerman is spoken almost as widely as English and is almost universally spoken near the Austrian border, especially in Sopron, which is officially bilingual and has significant contacts with Vienna due to its accessibility by Vienna suburban trains. \nRussian, which was compulsory in the Communist era, is spoken by a minority of Hungarians. Speaking Russian to Hungarians is a sensitive issue due to the history of unwanted Soviet domination, so be sure to begin the conversation in Hungarian and ask if the person speaks Russian before proceeding, and only use Russian as a last resort.\n\n\nGet in\nHungary is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:\n\nThere are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.\nThere may be identity checks before boarding international flights or ferries, even between Schengen countries, carried out by the operators.\nCitizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas for travelling in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.\nNormal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.\nRecognised refugees and stateless persons in possession of a valid travel document issued by the government of any one of the above countries/territories are exempt from obtaining a visa for Hungary (but no other Schengen country, except Germany and, for refugees, Slovakia) for a maximum stay of 90 days in a 180-day period.\nCitizens of Antigua and Barbuda are permitted to work in Hungary without the need to obtain a visa for the period of their 90-day visa-free stay. However, this ability to work visa-free does not necessarily extend to other Schengen countries.\n\n\nBy plane\n\nHungary's international airports are Liszt Ferenc Airport (BUD IATA) in Budapest, Airport Debrecen (DEB IATA) in Debrecen and H\u00e9v\u00edz\u2013Balaton Airport (SOB IATA) in S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k. The Hungarian national carrier, Mal\u00e9v (Hungarian Airlines) was closed down in early 2012. There are also several low cost carriers operating to Budapest: for example Ryanair, Wizzair, Easyjet and Eurowings.\n\n\nBy train\nBudapest is an important railway hub for the whole Hungary and large part of eastern Europe, with frequent trains from Austria, Germany, Czechia and Slovakia. There are at least one train daily from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Italy, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Switzerland and Ukraine, as well as through cars from Poland and seasonal through sleepers from Bulgaria and Montenegro.\nFor detailed info see Budapest#By_train.\nYou can search for international train connections at official schedule site of M\u00c1V, national train company, or at German Railways website covering almost whole Europe.\n\n\nBy car\n\nTo enter the country, ensure that your International Motor Insurance Card is valid for Hungary (H) along with the Vehicle Registration and a Power of Attorney from the owner if the car is not yours. The border guards are very strict about allowing cars through without these documents (see excepts below).\nThe Hungarian border control is very strict and thorough. They will not hesitate to conduct a full vehicle search if necessary.\nEntry from Schengen countries (Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia) is out of such border control since the abolition of physical borders. All those remain show light control and due to a bilateral agreement Serbian citizens are also no more undergo a strict border control. However you have to take into consideration that from Schengen area you might undergo a so-called inside-customs control wherever moving/driving in the country. Non-Schengen passengers must take into account facing a strict control upon customs prescriptions from Ukraine and Serbia. Coming from Serbia you are allowed to bring 2 packets of cigarettes into Hungary. If you bring more they will take it and fine for \u20ac102. Weapons for hunting are allowed to bring in from any EU member state if you have a European Licence. However with possessing that you may not buy or sell your or a new weapon here. The same is the situation with illicit drugs as well. Infringement of these rules may definitely lead to your immediate arrest!\nEntry from non-Schengen countries can take quite a long time, in particular in the summer months on the weekends when EU-Nationals are returning north along the E75 corridor from Belgrade, Serbia. The wait lines to get through the border have been as long as 7 km with a wait time of up to 6 hours. Alternative border points in Hungary or Croatia can be used to by-pass. If you are driving in from an EU country e.g. Austria, you are required to pull over to check with authorities at the border, otherwise, the borders are open and usually the immigration control kiosk are empty.\nWhen driving into Hungary, ensure that the border crossing on the route you choose allows the passage of foreigners. Also some smaller crossings close in the afternoon for the night. It is also required to buy a vignette for driving on highways. 20\u20ac for 10 days, 30\u20ac for a month as of 2024.\n\n\nBy bus\nSeveral international bus lines go in or through Hungary. You can find timetables and book tickets on  the homepage of Vol\u00e1nbusz, which is the national bus company and also the local Eurolines representation.\nAlternatively, Orangeways bus company offer services on routes between Budapest and Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Timetables and online booking are available on their website.\nOn the southern border with Serbia you shouldn't be surprised when there in the bus a collection is being held for a donation to the border-guards, to let the bus pass faster.\n\n\nBy ship\nIt is possible to enter Hungary by international shipping lines on Danube (Duna) or Tisza rivers.\nThere is a scheduled hydrofoil service on the Danube to and from Vienna and Bratislava between May and September operated by Mahart.\n\n\nFrom Slovakia\nYou can use the bus no. 91 of the urban traffic company of Bratislava (DPB) going to \u010cunovo in order to cross between Rajka (Hungary) and Bratislava (Slovakia). In Bratislava, the bus has Nov\u00fd most as its terminus, and near the Hungarian border you get on/off at the stop \u010cunovsk\u00e9 jazer\u00e1 (you need to signal to the driver if you plan to get off at this stop). From \u010cunovsk\u00e9 jazer\u00e1 it's a four-kilometer-long straight walk through a flat terrain to the town of Rajka, two kilometers on each side of the border. You may detour to visit a monument at the Austrian-Hungarian-Slovakian three country border.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy plane\nHungary has no regular domestic flights. As Budapest lies in the centre of the country and pretty much any point can be reached within three hours by train or bus, there isn't much need for scheduled domestic flights.\nHowever there are many opportunities for people with a valid pilot's license to rent a plane and explore by air.\n\nA Pilot's Academy of Malev Flying Club  T:+36 20 565-6467, Dunakeszi. Lightweight gliders and other stuff.\n\n\nBy public transport\nThere are multiple trip planning websites for Hungarian public transport, for example: utas.hu, menetrendek.hu  or uj.utvonalterv.hu (this seems to be available only in Hungarian but the first two are available in English). They provide real-time position information about your buses, as well as the planned schedule of the trains and allow you to plan your journey between any two points in the country.\nSome important words in Hungarian that may be helpful are:\n\n\u201chonnan\u201d - from\n\u201chov\u00e1\u201d - to\n\u201cAut\u00f3busz \u00e1llom\u00e1s\u201d - bus station\n\u201cnaponta\u201d - daily\n\u201cmunkanapokon\u201d - on workdays\n\n\nBy train\n\nThe Hungarian National Railway is M\u00c1V and GYSEV (some lines in the west of the country). M\u00c1V has online schedule and pricing site. You can purchase domestic and some international train tickets on the web in English. Read and follow the instruction here.\nThe train network is star-shaped (hub-and-spoke), fanning out from the centre at Budapest. This is caused by history because half of the once complete train system went to the neighbor countries after World War I. If neither the starting or ending point is Budapest, expect to travel for a long time often with change in Budapest.\nIntercity (IC) trains are the fastest, and they're up-to-date, well maintained and clean. They link the major cities with Budapest. Expect to pay about 550 Ft (= \u20ac2) extra fee independently from the distance for the mandatory seat reservation (not in international ICs, ECs). In some cases the extra charge can be lower. Compared to the majority of Western European ticket prices, Hungary's IC trains are among the cheapest, with an excellent record of speed and comfort. At the weekends many students use these IC trains to commute between Budapest and other cities, so an early advance booking is recommended on Friday afternoons for the trains leaving Budapest and on Sunday evenings for trains towards Budapest. Working with a notebook is generally safe, unless it's heavy overcrowded.\nOther train lines usually are not that fast, and not always cleaned up to the high standards (even in the 1st class), and are often vandalised (mostly in Budapest region); however, quality standards are improving. During summer trains linking Balaton to Budapest are sometimes overcrowded with the IC usually being sold out. The next choice is the gyorsvonat, or the old fast train. Pricing depends only on the distance and on the car class. Cash desks assume 2nd class by default for non-IC trains (at least in Budapest for English speakers), so if you didn't catch your IC, consider asking 1st class, paying small extra for much more comfort. Smoking is prohibited on all trains, as well as on the station platforms.\nSince March 2024, people aged 65 and older and people under 14 generally travel free of charge. People under 26 receive a 50% discount. There is also a nationwide 24-hour pass. It's called Hungary24 and costs 4999 Ft.\nIt is possible to buy Inter Rail pass for Hungary. Check whether buying tickets for each journey is cheaper.\nCheck the MAV site for a station list where you can buy a train ticket with a debit or credit card. A g\u00e9pi menetjegykiad\u00e1s is a staffed cashier desk; jegykiad\u00f3 automata is a vending machine.\nYou can buy tickets with euro. It is possible to purchase an international ticket and supplement at every Hungarian railway station which has an international cash desk. Cash desks do not accept euro bank notes of values above \u20ac50, and you will get the change in forints.\nA station list with ticket vending machine usually to destinations which are not enlisted by the vending machines, tickets will be issued without extra charge by the conductor on board. These ar working with a short midnight break.\nInternational bike transport on the train also possible on selected trains cost \u20ac4-10 (vary), first price to Vienna, the highest to Hamburg (via Berlin).\nList of e-ticket acceptance points like a vending machine. Buy the ticket on the Net and find at the station the pre-purchased ticket issuing machine to validate and print your ticket.\nThere are luggage rooms or lockers (Hu: csomagmeg\u00f6rz\u0151) in train stations. Lockers cost (since 2010): small 400 Ft, or bigger 600 Ft per 24hours. More than one day cost 600 Ft per each started day. An incomplete list of stations with Luggage rooms or/and lockers: Budapest-D\u00e9li, Kelenf\u00f6ld (Budapest), Budapest-Keleti, Budapest-Nyugati, Debrecen, Gy\u0151r, Miskolc-Tiszai, Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za, Si\u00f3fok, Sopron, Szolnok, Szombathely.\n\n\nBy bus\nHungary\u2019s national bus network is operated by 28 state run companies, united in Vol\u00e1n Association. Connections are frequent, and prices are identical to those on non-Intercity trains. Bus lines often are more complete than train lines, but the speed is quite similar. Long-distance buses are clean and safe, but often subject to delays. Buy your ticket at the station ticket desk before boarding; if you do not take your bus at a main station, purchase a ticket from the driver. Make sure that you validate tickets even when buying from the bus driver. The small orange boxes are used for validating tickets and are seen at several points throughout the bus. Ticket inspectors operate on the airport bus and if you have not validated your ticket, you are liable for a 7000 Ft on the spot fine. It is a good idea to reserve your tickets for national holidays, Friday and Sunday evenings beforehand. Online booking is available in English. You can plan your trip with any of the trip planning services mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.\nPeople aged 65 and older and people under 14 generally travel free of charge. Persons between 14 and 25 get 50% discounts.\n\n\nBy boat\nThere are several scheduled riverboat and hydrofoil lines operated by MAHART PassNave Ltd.  from the capital city Budapest to towns in the Danubebend, like Szentendre, Visegr\u00e1d and Esztergom, and also a good hydrofoil boat connection operated by the same company between Vienna and Budapest from May to September.\nIn the capital city there are several sightseeing and night cruises operated by MAHART PassNave Ltd. and other shipping companies, like Legenda Ltd.\nThere are some ferries on Danube and Tisza but their working hours are undependable. You can trust the ferry on Lake Balaton, though, for a modest price.\n\n\nBy car\n\nAggressive and unpredictable driving and speeds significantly higher than in northern Europe are a constant source of traffic incidents. Traffic lights are not always obeyed.\nMost roads in Hungary are two-lane, apart from modern motorways. Roads and motorways leading to Budapest are mostly in good shape; however, cracks, potholes and bumpy roads are common on minor roads and in major cities, though they are constantly being repaired. It is usually not difficult to travel by using a map and following road signs.\nExpressways are not free, but there are no other toll roads or tunnels. A vignette system is used, similar to that in neighboring Austria and Slovakia, but as of 2013 the vignette is stored electronically and checked for using gantries that read license plate numbers. You can purchase them in intervals of 10 days (called \"Weekly vignette\"), 1 month, or 1 year. The vignette is very important and it is a good idea to buy it even if you don't plan to use the highway. Control is automatic with video cameras and you will get a high ticket (20,000 Ft) automatically without any warning.\nIf you travel by normal roads the speed limit is 90 km/h between cities and 50 km/h inside, which slows you to the average around 60 km/h. Roads often have high traffic (especially main roads like #8 to the west, #6 to the south and #4 to the east). On highways the speed limit is 130 km/h, travel is the same as in Germany, and on the inside lane it is very common to have someone speed by you.\nExpect the Police to use speed traps of all kinds: fixed ones on all motorways which are signed, and mobile ones from bridges, cars standing on the shoulder or behind bushes and trees. Beware that some policemen hide around speed limit signs, especially when the sign visibly useless or if it's extremely slow for the given road type. Police corruption is widespread especially around Budapest (generally 10,000 Ft solves usual problems if you don't get arrested for it).\nWhen you cross the country from the west to the east (or vice versa), take into account that there are only a few bridges crossing the Danube outside Budapest. There are some ferries available though.\nOutside urban areas, it is a legal requirement to drive with headlights on, even during the day\u2014a requirement that is becoming more common across the EU.\nHungary has a policy of zero tolerance for driving under the influence of alcohol. If you are caught driving even after only having a couple of units of alcohol you are most likely to be arrested.\n\n\nHighways\n\nThere is a fast growing highway network in Hungary (1,480 km in total). Each highway starts in Budapest.\n\nM0 - Motorway ring around Budapest. The north-east and south sections are ready.\nM1 - connection to Gy\u0151r, Austria and Slovakia (west)\nM2 - connection to V\u00e1c, planned to reach the border to Slovakia by 2015 (north)\nM3/M30/M35 - connection to Miskolc, Debrecen and Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za (east)\nM5 - connection to Serbia, via Kecskem\u00e9t and Szeged (south-east)\nM6/M60 - Connection to Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros and P\u00e9cs(south)\nM7/M70 - connection to Lake Balaton, Croatia and Slovenia (south-west)\nM4 - connection to Romania via Szolnok (east)\nM44 - connection between the M5 at Kecskem\u00e9t and the Romanian border via B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba (east)\nM8/M9 - will cross the country (east-west)\nA single vignette is required to use all highways, except for M0 and short sections around major cities, which are free. Vignettes can be purchased online with bankcard on the official web  (and several private online companies, e.g. Hungary-vignette ), at filling stations and at \u00c1AK (State Motorway Management Co.) offices. A 10-day vignette for a passenger car costs 2975 Ft during summertime, the 4-day ticket for car has been cancelled. Vignettes are controlled automatically through a camera system.\n\n\nBy car pool\nThe Hungarian oszkar.com social car pool network/website will allow you to find cheap transport around the country and from (and to) many European cities (especially Vienna, but many German cities are also well \"serviced\").\nIn case you're not familiar with the idea: people who travel by car and willing to take passengers post their itinerary. You can hitch a ride by booking it on the website and then contacting the driver, whose contact information the website furnishes you with. People wishing to travel by car pool can also post and hope to be found by a prospective driver. Passengers are expected to contribute to the cost of the trip, but \"fares\" are typically much lower than bus/coach or rail fares (e.g. as of 2013, a trip from Vienna to Budapest may cost 2,500\u20136,500 Ft). A significant downside is that the site is in Hungarian (although you might be able to navigate it with a service Google Translate) and that booking (but not searching) requires registration, which is free. Drivers as well as passengers can rate each other after trips, much like at auction sites.\nDrivers are typically young adults (young enough to be familiar with the Internet and old enough to own their own cars); this also means they're slightly more likely to speak a foreign language than the average Hungarian, but you still shouldn't depend on it.\nSome commercial \"shuttle operators\" use oszkar.com to offer rides too; their postings are visually distinguishable from \"amateur\" ones.\nOszkar.com is a buyer's market: there are generally many more passenger seats available than passengers.\n\n\nBy taxi\nSee also: Budapest#By taxi\nInspect the change that taxi drivers give you. Cabbies commonly rip off tourists by giving them change in outdated Romanian currency, which looks similar to Hungarian currency, but is worthless and cannot be redeemed.\nRide-hailing is available in Hungary and the following are the most anticipated providers:\n\n Bolt. Works in Budapest, Debrecen and P\u00e9cs. (updated Jul 2020)\n\n\nSee\nHungary has several World Heritage sites.

Sopron is one of the most popular place for a sightseeing in the region.\nThere are also some amazing things to see.\n\nTiszavir\u00e1gz\u00e1s.

In February the people chase away bad ghosts by loud clamping on streets of Moh\u00e1cs.\n\n\nDo\nBirdwatching: Hungary has wooded hills, vast fish-pond systems and grasslands, the puszta. Particularly good areas are the Kiskunsag and Hortobagy National Parks and the Aggtelek, Bukk and Zemplen Hills.\nHorse riding: Vast areas of open countryside coupled with the long traditions of horsemanship make Hungary an ideal country for riding. Wide open plains in the south and forested hills in the north offer varied riding terrain.\nBaths: Thermal waters abound in Hungary, with over 1000 thermal springs many of which have been turned into baths and spas. The most famous are the Szechenyi baths in Budapest, but there are hundreds more. The cave baths at Miskolc-Tapolca and the spa at Egerszal\u00f3k are good examples. See also Budapest#Baths, Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za#Do, and a selected list of authorized medicinal waters.\nFootball: 12 teams play soccer in the country's top tier, Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g I or NB1; four of them are based in Budapest. The national team play home games at Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na in Budapest, completed in 2019.\nCycling: the premier race is the Tour de Hongrie held over four days in May.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nThe Hungarian currency is the forint, denoted by the symbol \"Ft\" (ISO code: HUF). Notes come in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 forint; coins are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 two-coloured, similar to \u20ac2) and 200 (two-coloured, similar to \u20ac1) forint.\nEuros are now accepted at most hotels and some of the restaurants and shops. Make sure you check the exchange rate, sometimes even well known places (like McDonald's) will exchange at unrealistic rates. Forints are to disappear in the coming years in favour of the euro, but no date has been fixed.\nYou can use major credit cards (EuroCard, Visa) in major shops and larger restaurants, but never expect that without checking first. Small places cannot afford to handle cards. ATMs are available even in small cities, the coverage is good. In Budapest, almost all businesses and services relevant to tourists support card payments.\nWhile completing any monetary transactions, it is best to pay in forint when you can. Some restaurants and hotels charge a steep rate for exchanging euros and often due to the fluctuation in forint, cost and services stated may vary drastically.\n\n\nMoney exchange\nShopping in Hungary is extremely cheap for people from the euro zone and the US. An exception to this rule is that luxury goods are often at higher prices than would be encountered in Western Europe or the US.\nExchange rates for euros and US dollars are roughly the same within central (at least in Budapest and Eger). Rates will likely be much worse in airports and large train stations, so only change what you need to reach the city centre. A good habit is to compare the buy and sell rates: if they are drastically different, you're best going somewhere else. Official exchange offices always give a receipt and normally have a large glass between client and a cashier making all steps transparent for clients.\nEuros are very widely accepted, in hotels, in some splurge restaurants or bars, in some shop (like all SPAR super/hypermarkets, usually at the cashdesk area is a board with the actual rate), or international cash desk of course the rates five even ten percent worse than in the banks and be prepared for the change they will get back in forint. Try using small notes (max. 50), at international cash desk even can pay also with coins and the rate is ok. Traded currencies at the two biggest Hungarian bank K&H Bank: AUD, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, JPY, NOK, PLN, SEK, USD; OTP Bank: same as K&H plus BGN, RUB and accepted Euro or Amex travellers cheques (commission). Smaller banks like Raiffeisen Bank (for CZK), Oberbank (for CHF) or Sberbank (for RUB) giving better rates, but not change so many currencies (need to check as it is variable). For your remained forints buying euros, US dollars and Swiss francs always available, but others only when in stock. More unusual currencies, such as Israeli shekels, Hong Kong dollars, or Ukrainian hryvnia, can only be exchanged at money changers.\nIf you arrive in Hungary at weekends, holidays or evening banks are closed only ATMs or money changer shops or some hotels (mostly the biggers). ATMs and banks can be found in hypermarkets.\nIf you arrive at Budapest Ferihegy Airport late at night or on state holidays changing money is possible as there are five interchange money changer offices. Opening times vary: from morning to around midnight, and one is open 24 hours a day. There is an ATM in the arrival hall at Budapest Ferihegy, and the rates for using ATMs with a card are often better than the bureau de change. Also Interchange has booths at D\u00e9li (one), Keleti (three), Nyugati (one) Railway stations. These are open daily from 07:00 or earlier to 20:50-23:30. Locations and opening time here. In the city centre of Budapest at #2 V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty square (:V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty t\u00e9r) branch is open 24 hours a day.\nThere are many ATMs in Budapest which will accept European and North American debit or credit cards. Be aware that \"Euronet\" ATMs have high charges in addition to any charges your own bank may apply, whereas ATMs operated by banks (e.g. OTP Bank, Raiffeisenbank) don't add extra charges.\nVisitors report that unofficial money changers operating nearby an official money changing booth offer unfavourable rates and recommend using the official exchange offices. Such exchangers are illegal and there is the possibility that you will receive other than Hungarian currency or nothing at all.\n\n\nTipping\nTips (borraval\u00f3) are given in Hungary for some services: in restaurants, in bars, to taxi drivers, to hairdressers, and often to people that fix things around the house, like plumbers and electricians.\nAlthough not legally required, social norms encourage that tips are given. 10% is usually enough. Check your receipt before you pay, because some bars and restaurants charge a 10% service fee (szervizd\u00edj), in this case tipping is not expected.\n\n\nShopping\nApart from classic tourist souvenirs such as postcards and trinkets, here are some things unique to Hungary or just hard to find elsewhere.\n\n\nHungarian foods\n\nDuck and goose liver\nSalamis - products of Hertz, Picks are the best, try Winter salami (Hu: T\u00e9liszal\u00e1mi)\nSweets Chocolates with fruit Brandy, Szamos Marzipan dessert, Praline with Truffle, szaloncukor, literally: \"parlour candy\", is a popular sweet at Christmas.\nCold-smoked sausages - Mangalica and grey beef specials\nHerbal Teas\nTruffle Products - Honeys, Jams\nSpices: Paprika and Hungarian Saffron\nGundel set of cheese: aged in Gundel wines or with walnut pieces or seasonings. Most easily found in 350 g sets of three kinds in duty-free of Ferihegy Airport in Budapest (at least in Terminal 2), but is likely available in Gundel 1894 Food & Wine Cellar (see Pest#Eat). Keep in mind that shelf life for this cheese is only 2 months.\n\n\nHungarian beverages\nChampagnes\nWines: the vineries of Badacsony, Tokaj, Vill\u00e1ny have the best products, but when purchasing wine beyond the right kind and vintage is also important the wine rack. The wrought iron with wine leaves is very showy, but if you are traveling by plane difficult to transport, so maybe a wood is more practical and you can buy a wide range of it. Other good names are: Soml\u00f3i Juhfark, Egri Bikav\u00e9r (see Liquor), Kadarka, red wine from Vill\u00e1ny area etc.\nP\u00e1linka: very famous and strong brandy made from fruits.\nUnicum: a herbal digestif liqueur.\n\n\nOthers\n\nBlack pottery  - part of the Transdanubian folk art\nPorcelain - look for high quality handmade Herend and Zsolnay products, usually sell them in set, simple candle holders are much cheaper and also popular\nHerend majolica at more affordable prices than the classic Herend.\nHungarian Cuisine book (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian)\n'maty\u00f3' patterned wooden spoons, ceramic of S\u00e1rospatak spoon holder\nEmbroideries such as patterned of Kalocsa or Maty\u00f3.\nBlueprinted textiles mostly linen or cotton materials\nDiamonds in handmade white gold, platinum inlaid jewellery, try your luck at Szentendre the Europe\u2019s largest diamond & jewellery centre\nHandicrafts and decorative arts works decorated with traditional, Hungarian folk motifs (letter-paper envelope sets, greeting cards, handkerchiefs, napkins, tablecloths, pillows, towels)\nThe Rubik's cube originated in Hungary and was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik and is one example of its longstanding gaming tradition.\n\n\nEat\nMain courses in menu are normally 3000\u20135000 Ft in touristy places in Budapest, 2000\u20133000 Ft outside it, or in towns like Eger and Szentendre. A two-course lunch with a soft drink in Budapest typically costs 3000\u201310000 Ft per person, and half or third of that outside Budapest. A Chinese fast food menu is around 1500 Ft. (updated Jan 2023)\nIn restaurants, a service charge is frequently included into bill, 10% or even 12%, but this has to be clearly pointed out on the menu. If it's not mentioned, the place has no right to include a service charge in the bill.\nEven if there's no service charge, unless the service was preposterous most Hungarians tend to leave a tip of 10% minimum. Unlike in most western countries, tip is usually not left on the table but rather the amount is specified to the waiting staff when you pay.\nThere were some places, mainly in the centre of Pest, that try to rip off drunk tourists at night by charging ridiculously high prices for drinks. Most of these places are closed now, but it's still a good idea to always check the prices before ordering.\nCommon in major cities and next to the highways are branches of major international chains such as KFC, McDonald's, Burger King,  Subway,  Pizza Hutand TGI Friday's last two just in Budapest.\n\n\nCuisine\n\nHungarians are quite proud of their cuisine (Magyar konyha), and most of the time not without reason. Food is usually spicy, but not hot by general standards, and it's tasty rather than healthy: many dishes are prepared with lard or deep-fried. The national spice is paprika, made from ground sweet bell peppers. \n\n Goulash (p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt). The national dish is goulash but Hungarians call the thick paprika-laden stew known as goulash elsewhere by the term p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt and reserve the term guly\u00e1s for a lighter paprika-flavoured soup.   (updated Dec 2023)\nMeat is popular, especially pork (sert\u00e9s), beef (marha) and venison (\u0151z). Less common are lamb and mutton. Chicken (csirke) and turkey (pulyka) are common, and you will also find game birds excellent in smarter restaurants and country areas: pheasant (f\u00e1c\u00e1n), partridge (fogoly) and duck (kacsa). Goose is also quite popular in Hungary. While tourists gorge on goose liver (libam\u00e1j), still cheap by Western standards, probably the most common dish is s\u00fclt libacomb, roast goose leg. The best fish in Hungary are river fish: carp (ponty), zander (fogas/s\u00fcll\u0151) and catfish (harcsa), though many restaurants will serve fish from far away. Another typical Hungarian fish meal is roasted hake (s\u00fclt hekk). Less well known in the rest of the world are csirke paprik\u00e1s, chicken stew in paprika sauce, and hal\u00e1szl\u00e9, paprika fish soup often made from carp.\nStuffed (t\u00f6lt\u00f6tt) vegetables of all kinds are also popular, and Hungarian pancakes (palacsinta), both savoury and sweet, are a treat. Common snacks include kolb\u00e1sz, a Hungarianised version of the Polish kielbasa sausage, and l\u00e1ngos, deep-fried dough with a variety of toppings (mostly sour cream, cheese, or garlic).\nA typical Hungarian meal will involve soup, often like a consomm\u00e9 (er\u0151leves), meat with potatoes (burgonya) and a side salad, and a dessert such as pancakes (palacsinta). A meal is almost always, even at breakfast, accompanied by Hungarian pickles called savany\u00fas\u00e1g, literally \"sourness\". These are often dubbed sal\u00e1ta on menus, so order a vitamin sal\u00e1ta if you want fresh vegetables. Starch is most often served as potatoes, rice or dumplings (galuska or nokedli). The primary Hungarian contribution in this field is an unusual type of small couscous-like pasta called tarhonya.\nIt is worth visiting a \"cukr\u00e1szda\" if you are in Hungary. These are very popular with delicious cakes and coffee. Try the traditional kr\u00e9mes (with vanilla cream), eszterh\u00e1zy (lots of nuts) or soml\u00f3i galuska.\nAnother favourite is l\u00e1ngos, which is deep-fried bread served served with various fillings. The most common is plain, with salt, garlic (fokhagyma) and soured cream (tejf\u00f6l). If you do come across a l\u00e1ngos stand, there are usually a large number of options from pizza l\u00e1ngos, or eggs with mayonnaise or Nutella and bananas.\n\n\nVegetarian food\nVegetarians and Vegans will have about as much ease eating out as in any other western country.\nBudapest is not a problem, as there is a wide variety of restaurants to choose from, but in an ordinary Hungarian restaurant the non-meat mains on the menu are pretty much limited to r\u00e1ntott sajt (fried cheese) and gombafejek r\u00e1ntva (fried mushrooms).\nItalian food is popular, so as long as you don't mind a pasta heavy diet as a vegetarian you will find a wider choice.\nFor self-catering, the selection of fruits and vegetables from supermarkets or local shops and market is quite good, especially in summer.\nThere are plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants, and a lot of health food stores that offer all sorts of vegetarian/vegan products, including cosmetics.\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nWine\n\nEgri Bikav\u00e9r (Bull's Blood of Eger) (1000 Ft for a good one) is a strong red Hungarian wine which supposedly saved a clever Hungarian girl from her fate with a Turkish sultan. During the time of the Turkish occupation, it is said a young girl was summoned to become a member of the local sultan's harem. Not wanting this fate for his daughter, her father gave her a bottle of Egri Bikav\u00e9r to take to the sultan. He told her to tell the ruler it was bull's blood, and would make him invincible. The sultan, being Muslim, was unaccustomed to alcohol, and proceeded to pass out, leaving the daughter unharmed. There is another story connected to why Bull's Blood is called so, and it also comes from the Turkish era. According to that one, the defenders of the different castles used to drink this red wine. When they saw the color on the mouths of the Hungarians, they thought that it must have been from a bull, thus the name.\nTokaj is known for its sweet dessert wines (Tokaji asz\u00fa), (2000\u20136000 Ft) which acquire their distinctive taste from grapes infected by the \"noble rot\" Botrytis cinerea.  The favorite tipple of aristocracy, past fans of Tokaji include Louis XIV (who called Tokaj as \"The king of the wines, the wine of the kings\"), Beethoven, Napoleon III and Peter the Great \u2014 which is still reflected in the steep pricing of the best varieties. Almost uniquely among white wines, Tokaj keeps well for a long time.\nIf new to Hungarian wine, be aware that both champagne (\"pezsg\u0151\") and wine, red or white, are quite likely to be sweet (\"\u00c9des\" or \"f\u00e9l\u00e9des\"). If dry wine is your preference, look for the word \"Sz\u00e1raz\" on the label. When buying bottled wine, don't bother with types cheaper than 600\u2013700 Ft, as these are usually very low quality (maybe not even produced from grapes). In wine cellars high quality may be available at surprisingly low prices.\n\n\nLiquor\nIn Hungarian, p\u00e1linka denotes strong brandy-like liquor distilled from fruit.  P\u00e1linka is a very social drink: just as the English drink tea, the Hungarians, especially in rural areas, will offer p\u00e1linka to guests upon arrival. The best-known varieties are barackp\u00e1linka, made from apricots, k\u00f6rtep\u00e1linka from pears, and szilvap\u00e1linka made from plums. Factory-made p\u00e1linka is widely available, but keep an eye out for homemade h\u00e1zip\u00e1linka. P\u00e1linkas usually contain around or above 50% of alcohol, often more for the homemade ones. P\u00e1linka bottles marked m\u00e9zes will be heavily sweetened with honey. (3000 Ft for something good)\nUnicum is a strong digestif made from a secret mix of over 40 herbs. It comes in striking black bottles emblazoned with a red and white cross, and has a very strong and unusual taste. Unicum Next has a lighter, citrusy flavor, and is rather more palatable. Definitely worth trying, the spherical bottle (affectionately called \"the Holy Hand Grenade\") itself may also be used for decoration, and keeps very well for a long time. It is available in every bar in Hungary but it is rare to see someone drinking it.\n\n\nBeer\nHungarian beer is quite average compared to other Central European countries like Germany and the Czech Republic as it has long been a wine culture.  The most common beers are Dreher, Szalon, Borsodi, Soproni and Arany \u00c1szok, available in the styles vil\u00e1gos (lager) and barna (brown). All of Hungarian breweries are owned and managed by international brands such as: Dreher S\u00f6rgy\u00e1r (Budapest); Heineken Hungaria (Sopron and Martf\u0171); Heineken; Borsodi S\u00f6rgy\u00e1r (B\u0151cs); P\u00e9csi S\u00f6rf\u0151zde (P\u00e9cs); Ottakinger.\nThey cost 200\u2013300 Ft at a store and 400\u2013600 Ft at a bar. Some expensive club can charge up to 900 in Budapest.\nImported beers like Pilsner Urquell, Staropramen and Budweiser-Budvar (the original Czech variety) are widely available in bars and markets for not much more than the ubiquitous Hungarian brands.\nWhen offering a toast with beer, be warned that most Hungarians will politely refuse. This is due to an old tradition due to remembering soldiers executed by the Habsburgs of Austria in the 1848 revolution, whereby it was decreed no Hungarian would toast with beer for 150 years. It's been so long, however, that most Hungarians no longer know the origins of this tradition or that they've been free to make toasts over beer for the past ten years.\n\n\nCoffee\nCafe culture is widespread in Hungary, although it may never recover the romance of its turn-of-the-century intellectual heyday. Unless asked, it's a good idea to specify what kind of coffee you prefer. The word k\u00e1v\u00e9 means the strong, espresso-like coffee, although American-style coffee, known as hossz\u00fa k\u00e1v\u00e9 in Hungarian, usually translated as \"long coffee\", is also available at most places.\n\n\nTea\nTea houses are becoming popular in cities, especially among the young. There is a growing number of tea houses, mainly in Budapest and some bigger cities where people can buy several types of loose tea. The best teas are herbal and fruit varieties. In restaurants and cafes, lemon juice is frequently served in a small bottle. However, in traditional restaurants or cafes good teas are hard to find as coffee are preferred.\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nHostels\nVery good rated hostels cost about \u20ac9\u201322 per night. The lower prices you usually get during week-days and in low season. (updated July 2022)\n\n\nFarmhouses\nVillage Tourism is popular and very well developed in Hungary, and can be a remarkable experience. Start your research with 1Hungary [1], National Federation of Rural and Agrotourism [2] and Centre of Rural Tourism [3].\nNear Budapest it is also possible to find rural houses to rent, for instance the Wild Grape Guesthouse [4], what makes a good combination to explore the capital and a National Park while staying at the same accommodation.\n\n\nCamping\nThere are campgrounds available. See the city guides, including the Budapest guide.\n\n\nLearn\nHungary is a country known for its rich academic tradition and cultural diversity, where education is highly valued. It boasts 13 Nobel laureates, numerous inventors, artists, and scientists, and is home to some of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Europe. Despite facing many historical challenges and transformations, Hungarians strongly believe in the power of knowledge to preserve their identity and sovereignty. This unwavering commitment to education and innovation has made Hungary a member of the European Union and a leader in several fields of science and technology.\nHungarian universities are open to all foreign students. Many European exchange students come through the EU's Erasmus program. There are quite a lot students from Asia and the Middle East as well, particularly because despite the high standard of education, fees are still considerably lower than in the more developed Western European countries. Those interested should visit Study in Hungary [5] or University of Debrecen [6] websites. Map of Hungarian universities and colleges.\n\n\nWork\nIt could be very difficult for an individual to seek legal employment in Hungary because of the complexity, cost and time involved. Most foreign workers in Hungary have received their visas and other necessary documents through the company they are employed by. It is hoped, however, that since the joining of Hungary to the EU a reduction will follow in the amount of red tape involved.\nCitizens of Antigua and Barbuda are permitted to work in Hungary without the need to obtain a visa for the period of their 90 day visa-free stay. However, this ability to work visa-free does not necessarily extend to other Schengen countries.\nMany students, usually on a gap year, work as second language teachers at one of Budapest's many language schools. A qualification is required (ESL/TEFL/TESOL) and experience is preferred.\nOne option is to teach through the Central European Teaching Program. For a placement fee they will take care of paperwork and set you up in a school in Hungary teaching English on a local salary. Contracts are for one semester or a whole school year. Qualified ESL/EFL teachers can find employment in Hungary at private language schools which offer better rates of pay and without having to pay a placement fee.\nSee also Work section in Budapest article.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nHungary in general is a very safe country. However, petty crime in particular remains a concern, just like in any other country.\nWatch your bags and pockets on public transport. There is a danger of pickpockets. Passports, cash and credit cards are common targets of thieves. Keep items that you do not store in your hotel safe or residence in a safe place, but be aware that pockets, purses and backpacks are especially vulnerable, even if closed. There are also reported cases of people who got their baggage stolen while sleeping on the train.\nGenerally, Hungary is rather quiet during the night compared to other European countries, and crime to tourists is limited to pickpocketing, and cheating on prices and bills and taxi fares.\nEveryone is required to carry their passport and ID card. Not doing so lead to trouble with the police. The police generally accept a colour copy of your passport.\nThe police force is professional and well trained, but most hardly speak any English.\nSee the Budapest travel guide for more specific and valuable information about common street scams and tourist traps in Hungary.\nDespite the government's controversial rhetoric regarding immigration, most Hungarians are not racist or xenophobic, and Budapest does have a small yet vibrant immigrant community. With that said, you might want to avoid living in rural areas if you are not white.\n\n\nDriving conditions\nThe majority of Hungarians drive dangerously and had 739 deaths on the roads in 2010. This is largely due to careless driving habits. Many drivers do not observe the speed limits and you should be extra careful on two-way roads where local drivers pass each other frequently and allow for less space than you may be used to.\nCar seats are required for infants. Children under age 12 may not sit in the front seat. Seat belts are mandatory for everyone in the car. You may not turn right on a red light. The police issues tickets for traffic violations and issue on the spot fines. In practice the laws are widely ignored.\nAlso, Hungarian laws have zero tolerance to drink and drive, and the penalty is a severe fine. It means no alcoholic beverage is allowed to be consumed if driving, no blood alcohol of any level is acceptable. Failure to pay fines may result in your passport getting confiscated, or even a jail term until or unless you pay the fine.\nMore importantly, the police stops vehicles regularly for document checks. You shouldn't worry when you are stopped because by law, everyone needs to have their identification papers checked.\nHungary has some of the harshest penalties for those involved in a car accident. Involvement in a car accident results in a fine, and maybe a prison sentence from 1 year to 5 years (depending on the aggravating circumstances).\n\n\nStay healthy\nFood and water is generally safe, even in remote villages. It is safe to drink tap water anywhere, even in remote areas, however, due to the cleaning process the taste of the water can be really unpleasant. Best idea is to try before changing to the bottled water. Bottled waters has a large selection, both the fizzy (blue bottle cap) and still (red/pink bottle cap) water and it is cheap (starts from less than 100 Ft for 1.5 litre). The only notable exception of the drinking water are trains where the tap water is not drinkable and other places where tap water is labeled as such.\nIt is widely available and good practice to have with you a bottle during hot summer.\nPrivate health care providers are high quality, but limited in scope once outside Budapest. Dentistry is cheaper here than in Western Europe (8000\u201310,000 Ft for an appointment and x-ray), and physiotherapy also (3000 Ft for a half-hour treatment), but check the price with the provider before you confirm the appointment. Outside Budapest you will likely have to speak basic Hungarian to communicate your needs as few doctors will have any English or German skills.\nPublic health care is free for qualifying (insured) people, and is of adequate quality in urban areas.\nThe country has joined the EU, so basic coverage is present for EU citizens, but check before entering the country how far are you insured and what you have to pay for. Do not expect at this time that the local doctor will know the EU rules, prepare to provide info.\nThe European Health Insurance Card is required from EU citizens applying for free treatment under this regulation.\nPharmacies are everywhere, you may expect high prices, but good pharmaceutical coverage. Sadly the situation clearly has worsened a lot since early 2010, as many pharmacies can not maintain an adequate reserve of medicines. Another problem might be communicating with the pharmacist as most of them speak only Hungarian. Quite unexpectedly some rusty Latin might come handy. Due to reduced trade between Hungary and andania (as of Dec 2006), some of familiar medications are unavailable\u2014so be prepared to find a substitute in advance.\n\n\nRespect\n\n\nGeneral etiquette\nHungarians are generally straightforward communicators. They are quite comfortable with expressing their innermost thoughts and feelings openly, and you can expect them to tell you exactly what they think. Although their directness may come across as blunt, assertive, or even rude to some, it's important to understand that they are not trying to offend or hurt anyone's feelings. They simply believe in being truthful and straightforward in their interactions with others.\nHungarians believe in strong familial values and often live with extended family members who provide both financial and emotional support. Therefore, it is important to show respect for the elderly. Don't use first names (keresztn\u00e9v) unless you've been told to, and compose yourself in a mature fashion around someone older than you. On public transportation, it is obligatory to offer your seat to older people. \nTalking loudly is generally considered rude. You will notice how most Hungarians tend to keep their voices down in public places.\nWhen entering a home, shoes should generally be taken off.\n\n\nSensitive issues\nThe 1956 Revolution continues to be a sensitive subject with many of the Hungarians, and anti-Russian sentiment is high due to the violent suppression of the uprising by the Soviet army. Even if you are the most ardent Russophile in the world, you should avoid saying anything positive about Russia as it could evoke strong feelings among locals.\nYou are well advised not to discuss the Treaty of Trianon (1920) at all \u2014 the Hungarians can take it surprisingly sensitively.\nOpen display of the Communist red star and hammer and sickle symbol, the Nazi swastika and SS symbols, and the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross, is prohibited by law. Make sure your clothing does not have these symbols on it, even if it's just a joke. You can be fined for it.\nMembers of the Roma community may find \"Gypsy\", or the traditional Hungarian label 'Cig\u00e1ny' (pronounced tzigan) to be offensive.\nAs a rural tradition, Hungarians affectionately refer to themselves as \"dancing with tears in our eyes\" (\"s\u00edrva v\u00edgad a magyar\"), as in a bittersweet resignation to the perceived bad luck in their long history. Avoid mocking Hungarian history and Hungarian patriotism.\n\n\nNational issues\nGiven Hungary's history of enduring turbulent events, the Hungarians exhibit sensitivity towards various historical occurrences. You should avoid discussing or bringing up the following topics as they can quickly unsettle people:\n\nHungarian Revolution of 1956 \u2014 the Soviets arrested and killed thousands of Hungarians for revolting against the Hungarian People's Republic, leading to the exodus of nearly a quarter of a million Hungarians.\nAnything regarding the Hungarian People's Republic \u2014 thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, exiled, and mistreated by the pro-Soviet communist government.\nHungary's relationship with Russia \u2014 although relations have improved since the early 1990s, there is some antipathy and distrust towards Russia in some circles.\n\n\nUncommon customs\nIt's an old tradition that Hungarians do not clink beer glasses or beer bottles. This is due to the legend that Austrians celebrated the execution of the 13 Hungarian Martyrs in 1849 by clinking their beer glasses, so Hungarians vowed not to clink with beer for 150 years. Obviously this time period has expired, but old habits die hard although less so by younger generations.\n\n\nConnect\nBroadband Internet access is now widespread in Hungary. It's quite usual to find free Internet access (wifi) in Shopping centers; in Budapest, most cafes and pubs. You'll have wifi access even in small towns. Look for the \"wifi\" signs, you may have to ask for the access password, however, if you consume, it will be freely given.\nThere are 4G coverage in most of the country while 5G is beeing deployed (july 2024),\n\n\nGo next\nThe land border can be crossed to Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia.",
