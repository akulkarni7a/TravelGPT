  "extract": "Curitiba is the capital of Paran\u00e1, Brazil. If you're heading for Igua\u00e7u Falls from Rio de Janeiro or S\u00e3o Paulo, it's worth stopping by for a day or two. There is a great cidade velha (old city) in the center which is in a very good state, considering the fact that it's been around for over 3 centuries. There is a huge arts and crafts fair every Sunday in the old city that is well worth visiting.\n\n\nUnderstand\nCuritiba is one of the largest cities in the prosperous Southern region, and its population is largely descended from German, Ukrainian, Russian, Italian and Polish immigrants. The city is known to urban planners worldwide for its innovative public transit system.\n\n\nClimate\n\nMany visitors from outside Brazil are not prepared to feel cold in this mainly tropical country. However, Curitiba, though close to the Tropic of Capricorn, is at an elevation of 932 meters (3,058 ft) above the sea level. These factors mean that winters (from June to September) can reach freezing temperatures, especially at night, making coats and other protection from the cold necessary. Even in the other seasons, cold nights are not unusual, though it rarely descends to 0 \u00b0C except during the winter. Summers, between December to March tend to be mild, with some hotter days of maximum through 30s \u00b0C or 90' \u00b0F, but occasional nights of 10s \u00b0C or 50s \u00b0F.\nCuritiba receives ample rain, there's no dry season, and it is rare to go more than 5 days without showers. Periods of a steady light rain or drizzle may last several weeks, typically foggy and grey, somewhat similar to London weather.  As in S\u00e3o Paulo, it is common for a day to start with a clear sky, start a thunderstorm for a few minutes and end with a beautiful sunset. Despite this, the months when it usually rains more in Curitiba are between October and March.\nSnow is very rare, with the last occurrence in 2013 and before that, 1975. But there are many places within 3-4 hours by car with snows every year in the winter, specially Palmas (364 km, 226 mi) and S\u00e3o Joaquim (438 km, 272 mi). Frost, nevertheless, is very common within the city limits and produces painting-like landscapes in the urban parks, notably Barigui Park and Jardim Bot\u00e2nico (until 08:00, before the sunlight starts to melt the frost).\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy bus\nCuritiba's Bus & Train Station (Esta\u00e7ao Rodoferrovi\u00e1ria) is a large station with 3 terminals (train terminal, interstate bus terminal and intrastate bus terminal) provides scheduled bus service from Curitiba to all over Brazil, as well as locations in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay.\nThe bus is the best way to come from or go through S\u00e3o Paulo and Florian\u00f3polis, since the travel doesn't last too long and the bus terminals are downtown in these cities (avoiding traffic jams and long transfers to distant airports). S\u00e3o Paulo Station is not exactly downtown but is nearby, and has a subway station inside the terminal. Curitiba-S\u00e3o Paulo: travel time 6 hr, R$60\u201380, departures every hour (there's no need to book in advance). Curitiba-Florianopolis: travel time 4 hr 30 min, R$50\u201370, lots of departures every day (although not so widespread than to S\u00e3o Paulo).\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Aeroporto Afonso Pena (CWB  IATA) (in the nearby city of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais and about 17 km (11 mi) from Curitiba city center). There are daily scheduled departures to S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Bras\u00edlia and other major cities. It also serves flights to other Paran\u00e1 State cities, such as Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Londrina and Maring\u00e1. International destinations with scheduled flights from Curitiba are Buenos Aires (Ezeiza), although other destinations may be eventually served on a non-scheduled basis. Major airlines such as Gol, Pluna and LATAM provide scheduled services to other cities, including those in Paran\u00e1 State, and international destinations. Other minor airlines, such as Passaredo and TRIP, also serve Curitiba in scheduled and non-scheduled basis.   \nIn winter months (June\u2013August), fog often causes the airport to close in the morning. Flights will then be cancelled or rerouted to nearby Joinville (130 km away) and Navegantes (230 km away) airports. If you want to avoid any trouble, during winter months choose flights landing or taking off after 09:00.\nThere are different options of ground transportation between Afonso Pena Airport and Curitiba city center. Regular city buses depart every 20\u201330 minutes on business days to Terminal Boqueir\u00e3o, from where it's possible to transfer free of charge to buses going downtown. To find the bus stop, on the arrivals floor walk on the same direction of cars until you see the tube-like structure. The R$ 4.30 fee can be paid in cash on the spot. The Airport Shuttle departs every 20 minutes on business days and is quicker than the city buses and much more comfortable, but its fare is R$ 15. Taxis are available 24 hours per day, plan on roughly R$ 60 to go downtown. There are more than 4 rental companies on site.\n\n\nBy train\nCuritiba has no scheduled passenger train service. However, there is a touristic train route that goes to Paran\u00e1 State's ocean coast, reaching its end in Paranagu\u00e1. It is definitely a worthwhile ride for those wanting to see natural and Atlantic Forest scenery, with many waterfalls, cliffs, peaks and historic sites. For more information see the Do section.\n\n\nBy car\nComing from S\u00e3o Paulo use BR-116 South. From Florian\u00f3polis use BR-101. From Porto Alegre use BR-116 North.\n\n\nGet around\nCuritiba is a household name among transit geeks worldwide and has for a time been a \"pilgrimage site\" for fans and proponents of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The idea behind the concept is to give buses many of the aspects of rapid transit without relying on rail vehicles, while being implemented for much cheaper and faster than any rail alternatives. As such, the system, known as Rede Integrada de Transporte (Integrated Transportation Network) features dedicated grade separated busways, bi-articulated and articulated buses with higher capacities than normal buses (in fact, comparable to a subway in many cases), express and \"local\" services that can overtake each other along the way, dedicated stations instead of mere \"stops\", level boarding, and offboard fare payment to make passenger able get on and off at all doors. The system has been widely praised for its success, emulated throughout the Americas, and has spurred transit oriented development near many stations, but it has in a sense been a victim of its own success with overcrowding making it difficult to handle the increase in population over the last years. Thus the city is supplementing the busiest routes with a rail-based underground metro system.\nDriving can be difficult for those who are not used to the traffic in Curitiba, especially for first comers. In the central area, there are many one-way streets, parking restrictions as well as pedestrian-only and bus-only streets. Bus lanes are very common in Curitiba, as the city has over 60 km (38 miles) of them. Most avenues are wide and have spacious sidewalks and they are mostly laid out in a grid system in the city center area.\nPublic transportation is probably the best option for those visiting the city. The fare is R$ 6.00 on Sundays, and you can connect for free between the bus routes if you connect inside the bus depots or the tube stations. There are also special services, like the City Center Circulator, which costs only R$1.50, the Touristic Route, which serves more than 20 attractions and allows each rider visit 4 of them paying only one fare, although expensive (R$27), and the Airport Shuttle, operated with mini-buses between Curitiba downtown and Afonso Pena Airport (R$8).\nActually the best way to come from the airport to downtown is a city bus lane called \"aeroporto\", which final stop is on the tube just next to the airport's main entrance. The fare is R$2.60, cheaper than the Airport Shuttle (R$10) and way cheaper than by taxi (R$50).\nThe public bus system is generally good in comparison with other Brazilian capitals, but overcrowded in rush hours.\nThe city of Curitiba has an efficient public transportation system that serves various areas, including the airport. One of the most notable lines is the E.32 Aeroporto/ T. Boqueir\u00e3o, part of the Ligeirinho system. This line, recognizable by its gray-colored buses, is distinct for making fewer stops compared to other lines operating in the capital. However, it's important to note that to reach downtown Curitiba using this line, a passenger will need to transfer at a specific terminal.\nFurthermore, there's an alternative option offered by the Aeroporto Executivo Company. Unlike the public E.32 line, this line has routes and stops that are more convenient for those wishing to travel directly between the city center and the airport. An additional advantage of using this line is the comfort provided by the minibuses equipped with Wi-Fi, USB chargers, and air conditioning. This premium service has a fare of 15 reais. Notably, among the stops of this line downtown, is the Shopping Esta\u00e7\u00e3o.\nDue to safety concerns, after 22:00, passengers can ask for bus drivers to stop anywhere along the route, not just in the designated bus stops. This is only valid for buses that are not part of the BRT system. After midnight, most buses stop circulating. From 01:00-05:00, buses known as \"madrugueiros\" circulate on an hourly basis. Bus schedules and itineraries can be consulted either from Google Maps or the city website Bus Schedule (machine-translated into English).\n\n\nSee\n\nMany tourist attractions are closed on Monday. The tourist bus is not running on that day either.\nMunicipal libraries, located at schools or public places, with a reference collection of five thousand books inspired by two ancient landmarks: the library and the lighthouse from Alexandria.

The park is equipped with installations suitable for rodeos and typical dances.\n\n1 Pico Paran\u00e1 (in Campina Grande do Sul is on the BR-116, the Mercosur Corridor, 25 km northeast of Curitiba). Highest point in the South region of Brazil.   \n\n\nDo\n\nThe Serra Verde Express, a train to the coastal town of Morretes, makes an excellent day trip and is for many tourists the main reason to visit Curitiba. The views from the train are unforgettable. The ride departs daily at 08:15 in the morning, descends through some of last remaining Atlantic rainforest and offers some spectacular views (not to mention it is one of the few train rides in Brazil). On Sundays the train continues to Paranagu\u00e1, although the last bit between Morretes and Paranagu\u00e1 is not very scenic. There are three price levels of the tickets claiming to offer different levels of luxury: one-way tickets are R$28 for econ\u00f4mico class (hard to come by), R$53 for turistico and R$84 for executivo class. Buy the cheapest ticket you can get since there really is not much difference between the cars. The return ticket is about 30% cheaper. In addition to the regular train, there's a special tourist train, the litorina, which only runs on weekends. The one-way fare for the litorina costs R$126.\nOne fun day trip is to leave the train in Morretes, and hitch a ride upstream by taxi or farmer's cart along the Nhundiaquara river. There is a bridge a few miles upstream  in a municipality called 'Porto de cima' where you can rent an innertube (boia cross in Portuguese), and get a ride a few miles upstream on dirt roads.  A fun float down the river through the tropical jungle is spectacular, refreshing, and you won't find a cleaner place in Brazil. An unforgettable day, especially if it is not a holiday time or weekend when it may be more crowded. Look for the bottle-hotel near the tube take-out point - that would be a memorable place to stay if it is open (seasonally).\n\n\nLearn\nForeigners interested in learning Portuguese will likely find Celin the most affordable course for its good educational standard. It is maintained by the Federal University of Paran\u00e1.\n\n\nBuy\n Feira do Largo da Ordem (Largo da Ordem's Street Fair). It is an open market, happens on all Sunday mornings, there you can find craftmanship, paintings, sculptures, typical foods, street artists, ecological pencils (Natural de Curitiba), old car exhibition and a lot more. \n Feira da Pra\u00e7a da Espanha (Spain Square's Fair). Open on Saturdays, from 10:00-17:00. It is a fair with many antiquities and book dealers, placed at the Spain Square. (updated Aug 2016)\nSome of the best places to go shopping in Curitiba, just like in any other place in Brazil, are the Shopping Malls.

Stay away, or move yourself fast and cautiously, from streets where there are few or no people in the sidewalks, especially around the Historical Center, anytime. Both residents and tourists should avoid rambling long distances after dusk. In spite of the fact that Curitibans are more reserved people compared to the average Brazilian, the lack of people in the streets at night reflects a general fear of thefts and assaults, as most people prefer to get around by car.\nCrime involving tourists is generally non-violent and related to thefts and pickpocketing. It is recommended not to carry cameras and expensive cellphones with you when walking on the streets, specially at night. Such items may attract the attention of robbers and pickpocketers.\nIn general, neighborhoods are relatively safe, however caution should be exerted in the following (particularly, but not exclusively, at night):\n\nSurroundings of the Main Bus Terminal (Rodoferrovi\u00e1ria); if you arrive late, take a taxi even if your hotel is close.\nDowntown squares - during the day are fairly safe, nonetheless, after 8PM, they are generally a hideaway to drug dealers and thefts - give preference to the streets on the edge of the squares instead of passing through them.\nHistorical Center/Old City.\nBatel neighborhood - always exercise common sense.\nRebou\u00e7as and Prado Velho, neighborhoods within a distance of 2 km from the city center (southbound).\nThe neighborhoods on the south side of the city (Sitio Cercado, Fazendinha, Pinheiriho, Cidade Industrial, Tatuquara), are the poorest areas and so far the most dangerous places, albeit there are less or no attractions there to the regular tourist. Home of roughly 1/3 of the population, these places also host the majority of the city's shantytowns. More avoidable neighborhoods: Parolin (south side), Cajuru and Uberaba (east) and Campo Comprido and S\u00e3o Braz (west).\nAt night it is best to get around by taxi. The public transportation systems are almost entirely off after midnight. For more, see the section on transportation.\nIn general, a common-sense approach to personal safety is advised. Curitiba is a big city, and with it come the usual problems (poverty, homelessness, drugs, prostitution, etc.) Be cautious with your personal belongings, and avoid walking around empty areas by night.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nLanguage\nPortuguese is the primary language spoken by most curitibanos. Most people don't speak English beyond simple phrases.\n\n\nWater\nThe quality of tap water in Curitiba is considered to be good quality and safe to drink (unless you are in an old building with outdated plumbing).\n\n\nConsulates\n  Romania, Av. 7 de Setembro, 4881, 110 andar, conj. 111, CEP: 80240-000 PR, \u260f +55 41 32443899, +55 41 99744199, consulromenia@uol.com.br, orcival@uol.com.brMULTIPLE-EMAIL.
