This legend also gave the city its current name; its previous name is said to have been Nerluc.\n\n1 Office de Tourisme de Tarascon (http://www.tarascon.org/), 62 Rue des Halles, \u260f +33 4 90 91 03 52, tourisme@tarascon.org.

As a starting point for their campaigns in the Mediterranean, the Dukes of Anjou Louis II and Louis III built fortress-like chateau from 1400 to 1435.
