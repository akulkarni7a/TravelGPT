In 1941, with the completion of construction of the primary school, at the request of then-Mayor Braulio Pereira Barreto, two Imperial Palms were planted in the grounds of the former School Group, whose building today houses the P\u00f3lo Cultural Adaly Coelho Passos. There are only one palm tree hw, which measures more than 20 meters high, and is appreciated by the passerby. The other, located on the street corner with Paul Harris street, fell in March 2010, due to strong winds on two consecutive days, which according to official sources, reached 120 km/h. \n Church of St. Anthony. Began as a chapel in the 17th century. Since then, it has been elevated to the category of parish church and has been continually upgraded. \n Obelisk - Tap. This obelisk commemorates the start of a new phase of sanitation in Caraguatatuba, with distribution of piped water, though untreated, which was inaugurated by the President of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Altino Arantes, in 1919. \n 1st Centennial Monument - Sundial. The monument was part of the celebrations of the first centenary of the city. Commissioned to engineer Accacio Villalva, in 1957. It's another obelisk, with a needle-shaped base, measuring three meters high, fitted with a sundial. \n Bandstand. The first bandstand was built in the 1930s by Dona Belmira Nepomuceno. The small square needed a space for presentations of popular festivities. In 1971, the management of the then Mayor Silvio Luiz dos Santos, the old bandstand was demolished and replaced by a new one. In 2005 it was again renovated, gaining a new look. Every reform aimed to preserve one of the most important historical sites of the city that for decades has been the meeting place of the community, where there are many cultural events such as the presentation of the Municipal Band Carlos Gomes. \n Musical Luminous Fountain (Fonte Luminosa). Inaugurated in the 1960s, by then Mayor Geraldo Nogueira da Silva. \n\n\nBeachfront\nCal\u00e7ad\u00e3o - This quaint brick-paved pedestrian mall in the center of town serves as the local meeting place and makes for a pleasant stroll.\n\n\nCountryside\n Santo Ant\u00f4nio Hill (Morro de Santo Ant\u00f4nio), Rio-Santos highway, towards Ubatuba (Access  by Estrada da Serraria (Sawmill Road), Sumar\u00e9 neighborhood.).

There is a flight deck for those jumping and hang gliding and paragliding. It's one of the most appreciated sites by those who practice free flight. Access to the site is monitored on a checkpoint that sits on top of the climb. The number of cars is restricted, only 18 vehicles can climb at a time and stay is only 15 minutes. Therefore, many visitors prefer to leave the car and walk up.

In reality, murders in the city are mostly related to drug trafficking, and for the ordinary tourist, Caraguatatuba is relatively safe, actually safer than the core Baixada Santista cities (Santos, Guaruj\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Vicente).\nYet, the city offers certain risks for the visitor. Avoid walking during the night, including the beach, except in well-lit areas with other people in the streets. For example, during the evening you can visit the crafts fair in the city center, which stays open until late in high season. When renting a summer house, check the security of the area and security devices, as groups of armed criminals are known to assault summer houses (if you have doubt, stay in a hotel). Never venture into lower-class neighborhoods, not even during the day.\n\n\nStay healthy\nAs elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Caraguatatuba are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day. On the day of your visit, check the map of the latest weekly beach quality bulletin (in Portuguese, boletim de qualidade das praias) of the state's Environment Department (CETESB).\n\n\nGo next\nHostels and private rooms are offered:\n\n\nin the south and west:\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o \u2013 30 km. The beaches of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o are a mixture of rustic paradisiac nature with first class night life. Contains one of the most famous beaches of the S\u00e3o Paulo coast, Maresias.\nIlhabela \u2013 35 km. It is an archipelago with various savage beaches and ecotourism options.\nCamburi and Boicucanga \u2013 70 km. It is considered by Paulistas as one of the best beaches on their coastline. There are also quite a few small restaurants and bars along the road going through Camburi. Camburizinho beach is right next door.\nBertioga \u2013 120 km. A laid-back sea-side town with excellent beaches. It's one of the safest towns of the S\u00e3o Paulo coast. From there to Guaruj\u00e1, Santos or S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\nin the north(-east):\nUbatuba \u2013 50km. Beautiful beaches are the main attraction of this place, as well as its well-preserved nature. You can do mountain biking and trekking. One of the best places in Brazil to practice surf, nautical sports, diving and birdwatching.\nParaty \u2013 120 km. A fully-conserved 18th-century colonial town by the ocean, hidden by tall jungle-covered mountains which used to be a hideout for pirates after the Portuguese ships; a must-see for people interested in history and culture; also good for rainforest hiking and kayaking.",
