  "extract": "Manaus is a metropolis of Brazil with about 2.6 million inhabitants in the center of the Amazon rainforest. Traveling to Manaus means taking a trip to the Amazon: there are countless jungle hotels that offer a huge variety of tours, from more adventurous to more relaxing, such as walking in the jungle, fishing, visiting riverside communities, alligator spotting, tree climbing, rappelling, and  bototherapy. In the center of Manaus there are several monuments, historic buildings, churches, a large number of museums, and numerous Belle \u00c9poque buildings still preserved and spread throughout the region.\n\n\nUnderstand\nIts name means \"Mother of Gods\" in the indigenous language. Two rivers run side by side for many miles of different colors, running together: the \"Meeting of Waters\". Legend has it that they never mix.\nThe wealth of the primeval forest becomes visible first of all in the architecture of the city. The city enriched and the rubber barons afforded big European luxury such as the Amazonas Opera House. Other monuments from this epoch are the Mercado Municipal, and the arts center Palacio Rio Negro, located among fascinating Portuguese fa\u00e7ades. Today Manaus is a foreign trade zone. Foreign enterprises pay no import duties here, guaranteeing a certain income for the city and the region. Electronics, wood industry and oil refineries have settled in the outskirts in industrial areas. The harbour is the most important trading center for the care of the city with regional, national and international products.\nThe city is pleasant and friendly, although quite hot, and is still a major port, and a good starting point for river tours.\nThe Rio Negro (northern) branch of the Amazon is the color of strong tea, peaty brown and its comparative acidity means few mosquitoes. At Manaus the Amazon rises and falls almost twenty meters between seasons.  In May and June it's at its peak, full and very wide, spreading way out into the trees.  In November and December it's low; still massive but with sandbars.\nOf all cities you can reach when voyaging along the Amazon River, Manaus is by far the most expensive.\n\n\nClimate\n\nIn the heart of one of the most humid tropical forests in the world, expect a lot of heat and humidity in Manaus. Average temperatures in Manaus tend to exceed 30\u00ba C (86\u00ba F), but with a greater thermal sensation, due to humidity. In September, temperatures often reach 40\u00ba C (104\u00ba F).\nManaus does not have winter, summer, spring or autumn; there are only two seasons in the city: a rainy season (from December to May), with long periods of continuous rain and frequent thunderstorms that fill the rivers, forming igap\u00f3s (forests flooded by rivers, similar to swamps), and a season drought (from June to November), when it still rains, but to a lesser extent. At that time, the rivers lower the waters and begin to form beaches on the banks.\nRegardless of the time you visit, it is recommended to wear light clothes and an umbrella to protect yourself from showers and high temperatures.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Manaus International Airport / Eduardo Gomes (MAO  IATA) (The airport is some 15 km by road from the city centre). The airport is modern and clean, and the airside has many 24h shops. Flights on the wee hours are common at this airport, and some passengers overnight there.   (updated Nov 2019)\nManaus is over 2,700 km from S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro which takes about four hours by air. Coming from North America or Europe, if you can't get a direct flight, the best option price- and route-wise is probably to connect in Fortaleza FOR IATA, the international hub of Northern Brazil (and it might be considerably cheaper to buy an international ticket to Fortaleza and independent domestic one from Fortaleza to Manaus).\nDirect international flights:\nBuenos Aires:\n\nMiami: daily with American Airlines and once a week with Latam\nOrlando: once a week with Gol Linhas A\u00e9reas\nPanama City: 4 days a week with Copa Airlines\nBrazil flagship airlines Latam, Gol and Azul have frequent direct flights to major Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Bras\u00edlia, as well as regional capitals, and Azul also flies to the triple border town of Tabatinga. Regional airline Mapoperates a turboprop fleet to towns such as Tef\u00e9, Parintins, Altamira and Porto Trombetas.\nFrom the airport to the region of the Amazonas Theater, city bus line 306 costs R$ 3,80 and line 813 with aircon costs R$ 4,20 (the latter are similar to minivans and you'll feel cramped if carrying big luggage). A similar ride costs around R$ 20 on mobile hailing car apps when no surge factor is in place, and R$ 52 by conventional taxis (April 2019).\n\n\nBy boat\nManaus is a major destination for boats on the Amazon River. From Bel\u00e9m on the Atlantic Coast, it takes about five days. Boats go to Porto Velho two-three times per week. Tabatinga on the border with Colombia can also be reached by boat from Manaus, with connections further on to Iquitos in Peru. For finding boat connections between Tabatinga and Manaus Navegam covers this route. If you want to save a few hours on your way to Colombia or Peru, ask the according boat company if they stop in Manacapuru, so you can take the boat from there.\n\n\nBy bus\nDue to road conditions, there is very little (if any) long-distance bus service originating from major cities in Brazil.  There are daily buses to Boa Vista in the north and to destinations in Venezuela. The bus from Caracas in Venezuela takes about 36 hours, but it is air-conditioned, has comfortable reclining seats and a toilet.\n\n\nGet around\n\nManaus is very big, its urban part sprawling some 400 km2 (150 sq mi) (versus 100 km2 (39 sq mi) for Paris or 200 km2 (77 sq mi) for Buenos Aires). If you plan to move around the city independently, it's important to find accommodation either downtown or close to the main axis of Av. Constantino Nery and Av. Djalma Batista.\nThe main city transit option is buses, and the fare is R$ 3.80 (April 2019). One can change buses free of charge at the city terminals T1, T2, T3 and T4, or use a city bus card to board a second bus within 1\u00bd hr free of charge. To get a card, visit one of SINETRAM offices - the first card for each person is free, then R$ 15.\nThere is a system of city bikes called MAN\u00d4bike, but it's only available downtown where distances are walkable. Besides, Manaus is somewhat hilly and inconvenient for most uncommitted riders.\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Teatro Amazonas (Amazonas Opera House), Pra\u00e7a S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, Center, \u260f +55 92 3622-1880. The Opera House was built during the heyday of rubber trade, using materials from all over the world, and was once visited by all the most famous opera divas and maestros. Regular guided tours in English, R$ 20. There are frequent free performances, often advertised on the SEC Facebook Channel; be sure to arrive at least an hour in advance to secure a seat. Also, check out the Largo de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o just to the east to experience this square with Opening of the Ports of Friendly Nations statue and historic buildings around.   (updated Apr 2019)\n Saint Sebastian, Martyr and Saint Francis of Assisi Parish (Par\u00f3quia S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, M\u00e1rtir e S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis), Rua 10 de Julho (across from the Largo de Sao Sebastiao.). This spooky-looking 19th-century neoclassical church with an Italian-style interior looks so much older. (updated Oct 2020)\n2 Museu da Casa Eduardo Ribeiro, R. Jos\u00e9 Clemente, 322 - Centro, \u260f +55 92 3631 2938. Tu-F 09\u02d000-17\u02d000, Su 09\u02d000-13\u02d000, closed F Sa. Original home of first Afro-Brazilian governor of Amazonas state who made modern Manaus. (updated Oct 2020)\n3 Mercado Municipal Adolpho Lisboa (City market), Rua dos Bar\u00e9s s/n. 8h-22h. After a renovation, most stalls were moved to the nearby Feira da Banana and Adolpho Lisboa became a clean and organized market, albeit lacking some soul. The main hall sells mostly souvenirs, the smaller ones to the left and right fish and meat. The restaurants inside it are affordable (mains for R$13-20) and a great option on Sundays and holidays when the majority of cheap eateries are closed.   (updated Apr 2019)\n4 Pal\u00e1cio Rio Negro (Rio Negro Palace), Av. 7 de Setembro, 1546, \u260f +55 92 3232-4450. 09:00-17:00. Built by a German rich-man in the \"golden age\", the palace eventually became property of the government, which transformed it in a cultural center. Visits are free, being escorted by a staff-member is compulsory. Around the estate are manicured grounds and paths that culminate to the south at Parque Jefferson Peres, an impressive plaza of fountains, canals, and statuary close to the Rio Negro.   (updated Apr 2019)\n5 Praca Heliodoro Balbi (Heliodoro Balbi Square). Leafy plaza that is abutted by the Provincial Palace and Police Square. (updated Oct 2020)\n6 Palacete Provincial (Provincial Palace) (on Heliodoro Balbi Square), \u260f +55 92 3631 3632. Daily 09\u02d000-15\u02d000. This grand architectural specimen is also host to several museums, including the Museu de Arqueologia, the Pinacoteca do Estado (plastic arts center), Museu Tiradentes da Policia Militar (military police museum), Museu De Numism\u00e1tica Bernardo Ramos (numismatics), and an art museum. Get all your museum-viewing done in one shebang. (updated Oct 2020)\n7 Biblioteca P\u00fablica do Amazonas (Amazonas Public Library), R. Barroso, 57 (between the provincial palace and the metropolitan cathedral), \u260f +55 92 3234 0588. This eyecatching building was constructed in 1910 in the neoclassical style, with marble, chandeliers, and skylights from England. During the times of the rubber boom, the library was frequented by the elites of Manaus. Then, with the fall of that the library also fell into disrepair and tragically was consumed in a conflagration that left only 60 books. But it has since been restored.  (updated Oct 2020)\n8 Casa das Artes (House of Arts), R. Jos\u00e9 Clemente, 564, \u260f +55 92 3631 6227. Tu-Su 13\u02d000-19\u02d000, closed M. Local art works.

Manaus' metropolitan church which has a cathedral museum dealing with Catholic relics and the pope's visit to Manaus.

A relatively new showcase about the city, its people, and local foods and culture. The architectural exterior and interior of the building is quite opulent in itself, as is the Rio Branco Palace, which is the state assembly building, just to the south. (updated Oct 2020)\n11 Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico e Hist\u00f3rico do Amazonas, R. Frei Jos\u00e9 dos Inocentes, 132, \u260f +55 92 30853637. Monday only 14\u02d000-17\u02d000.

Ramos Ferreira, 1036, \u260f +55 92 3305 1181. Su-F 08:30-12:00, 13:00-17:00; closed Sa. Yet another Amazonia museum, this one in a colonial house, and curated by the public university. Nice baskets and masks and caiman skull collection. (updated Oct 2020)\n13 Parque Rio Negro. daily 06\u02d000-22\u02d000. Nice promenade along the Rio Negro from which to view the river or Manaus. A chance to see some old factories and also grab a sno cone or helado from a kiosk as you catch a glorious sunset on the Amazon. (updated Oct 2020)\n14 Praia da Ponta Negra (Ponta Negra Beach) (catch buses 120 or 126 from downtown). Copacabana's river counterpart, this fine sand beach has a very nice urbanized area on its back, with a large walkaway, a skateboard park, some beach volleyball fields and many food stalls. On Wednesdays and Sundays the car traffic is interrupted and locals occupy the extra space jogging, roller-skating and skateboarding. It hosts free dancing and calisthenics classes organized by the city, and some independent groups also meet there for activities, such as the slackline Mexa-se group. The adjoining neighborhood has the most expensive sq-meter in Manaus, so your a\u00e7a\u00ed will cost more at Ponta Negra (around R$ 11 for 300 ml).  (updated Apr 2019)\n15 Instituto Nacional De Pesquisas INPA, Av. Andr\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo, 2936 - Petr\u00f3polis, \u260f +55 92 3643 3377. M-F 08:00-12:00, 14:00-18:00; closed Sa Su. An aquatics sort of exhibit where you can have the chance to see turtles, otters, and even a manatee. Exhibits and demonstrations about Amazonian aquiculture. There was another place called Museu de Ciencias Naturais da Amazonia similar to this nearby that even had the mighty piarucu along with entomology and ornithology displays, but it appears to have closed down.  \n Paricatuba Waterfall (On the right bank of the Negro River, along a small tributary). Formed by sedimentary rocks, surrounded by abundant vegetation. Access is by boat. The best time to visit is from August to February. \n Love Cascade. In the Guedes bayou, with cold and crystal clear water. Accessible only by boat then hiking through the forest. \n Meeting of the waters. The muddy Solim\u00f5es and the dark-colored Negro rivers meet, and run together without mixing for a considerable length, about 4 km downstream of the city. You can book a dedicated tour for this, but when you enter/leave Manaus by boat towards Santar\u00e9m/Bel\u00e9m, you will see it much better from the upper deck of that boat. It's about 30 to 60 minutes downstream from Manaus on a slow boat and you can easily spot it in advance due to the water being much brighter. Also in this area is a community of floating houses called Catal\u00e3o that some tour operators may include as a cultural part of a package. \n16 Bridge Phelippe Daou (Rio Negro Bridge). This roughly 3.2-km-long bridge over the Rio Negro is quite an engineering marvel that is almost certain to catch your eye.   (updated Oct 2019)\n\n17 Centro Cultural Usina Chamin\u00e9, Av.

A church that is a special part of Manaus' heritage as it came about from a wife's vow in the late 19th century to have a chapel built in appreciation for the saint who supposedly interceded for her poor severely ill husband. The church is colloquially known as Capela de Pobra Diablo. Only open every June 13th. (updated Oct 2020)\n27 Santu\u00e1rio Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima, Pra\u00e7a 14 de Janeiro.

(updated Oct 2020)\n\n\nDo\n\n\nAdventure trips to the rainforest\nThere are a number of companies operating jungle adventure trips from Manaus, but only a few seem to be more established and reputable. First you need to check if the Tour Operator has a valid Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board) registry. Then you make up your mind what you really want.\nYou need to travel at least 100 km from Manaus to see virgin rain forest and the wild life you are looking for.\n\n\nLocation\nThere are basically two main areas which you can explore: the Rio Negro basin and the South of Rio Amazonas. Both of these regions are (sparsely) inhabited, so you will not be completely isolated from civilization. If you want to make a trip to a reserve or a remote area, ask for a special expedition package and plan to pay much more and spend a few days for the transfer to and from the reserve. Rio Negro is an area that is great for the jungle vegetation and for the lack of mosquitoes (due to the acidity of the river). Unfortunately, the lack of mosquitoes means there are a lot fewer animals that live there. The South of Rio Amazonas is a network of rivers, lakes and channels. There are mosquitoes and wildlife, however, there are quite a lot of houses and farms\u2014and thus civilization is a lot more visible. Most tours go to or through lake Mamori. There are quite a lot of jungle things to see around the lake, but do not expect pristine nature due to all the farming going on around the lake. There is a reserve nearby called Jurara. It also seems to be inhabited and there is not much difference between the reserve and lake Mamori. A better option may be a trip to lake Juma which is a special protected area.\n\n\nTime of travel\nThere are two seasons in the Amazon basin: wet season and dry season. During the dry season it's very hot (that means 40 \u00b0C plus the humidity) and thus may be unbearable for some. As well, many channels and rivers dry out. On the other hand, fishing is much easier since all fish concentrates in the remaining water basins. During the wet season, it rains almost every day. When there is a storm, the amount of rain may be overwhelming. Thus, if traveling in wet season, be prepared to get wet and not dry out until the end of your trip. During the season the rivers and lakes rise several meters and many new channels are formed in the flooded jungle. Temperature-wise, the weather is more bearable and only the humidity will be a problem. The wet season lasts roughly January to July, with the best time to visit the jungle May to August.\n\n\nEquipment\nIf you travel during the wet season, keep your important things like documents in (tested) waterproof bags/containers. Cotton clothes let your skin breathe but there is no chance that they will ever get dry. Some people find nylon/synthetic clothes to work well. Long sleeves and long pants are not 100% necessary but you will not regret wearing them. A flashlight is necessary for the night, as the jungle is pitch-black. A machete most probably will not be required on short/casual trips but is essential for longer expeditions. A lighter and a pocket knife are a good idea. The pocket knife is especially important since it can provide the only defense against the boa and the anaconda (indeed, attacks do occur). A mosquito repellent is most probably a very smart idea. It keeps other bugs away too and it reduces the risk of being infected by a disease-carrying insect. However, the number of mosquitoes in the jungle is not completely overwhelming, so for longer expeditions you may consider getting used to them. Additionally, a good guide can show you some natural repellents available in the jungle. Sun block is needed especially during the dry season. Otherwise, keep your luggage to the minimum. Do not take things you do not really need.\n\n\nTerminology\nnative people - people who live in the region. Most of the time that means mixed people of Portuguese descent. These are not aboriginal inhabitants.\nnative guide - a guide who is a native (see native people). If at all, usually speaks only marginal English.\n\n\nAmazon tour operators\nDo not buy tours from people at the airport or on the street in Manaus. The best guides are hired by the best companies; the best shysters don\u2019t work for the best companies. If you don\u2019t want to book a tour before arriving and want to book a tour in Manaus use a reputable published guidebook first or just look for the official tourist information center (CAT), they'll help you out and even make free calls if required. Tour companies are relatively easy to find in downtown Manaus and many will meet you at no charge.\nThe tour companies tend to trick the tourists sometimes, they ask you \"may I do the reservation?\" if you say yes and later cancel they will want to charge you 25%. It is not legal unless they let you know about it and make you sign something, so remain alert. Ask other tour operators to check prices.\nIf you take a river tour, go up the Rio Negro. From a three-night river boat trip from Manaus up the Rio Negro with a guide, you can expect to see some wildlife and visit some of the forest remnants, but two weeks or more are needed to reach untouched areas. Small two-story river boats carry five to ten people, sleeping in hammocks on the upper deck. Large boats carrying hundreds ply the river too, but the big boats don't stop between ports. The most popular place for jungle tours is Lake Mamori/Lake Juma about 100 km south of Manaus. Other recommended areas are Rio Urubu about 200 km east of and Novo Air\u00e3o about 100 km northwest of Manaus.\nMake sure that your travel agency has a valid Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board) registration.\n\n Amazon BackPackers Tour, \u260f +55 92 99414-9813.

Breakfast and afternoon tea available daily. R$208. (updated Oct 2020)\n\n\nStay healthy\n\n\nHeat and sun\nThe climate is very hot and humid. Packing thin, light-colored clothing will help you suffer the least during the day. Locals are often seen using umbrellas as sun-protection while walking the streets, and you should consider doing the same.\n\n\nVaccinations\nDo take yellow fever vaccination at least 10 days before landing in the Amazon region. One shot of this vaccine offers lifelong protection.\nManaus and the nearby jungle regions most tourists visit on 2- to 5-day tours are relatively malaria-free, so one should ponder carefully if the benefit of malaria drugs offset the many inconveniences. Malaria drugs are known to cause lack of energy and belly discomfort in a number of people, and the frequent need to visit the toilet might spoil boat rides and longer tours. Also, some doctors, following a more modern line, have been recommending tourists to carry the drugs but to only take them if symptoms arise, as this is efficient enough. Do your own research and decide on the best approach for yourself. Mosquitos that are malaria carriers are more active from dusk to dawn.\nTo avoid mosquito bites, apply insect repellent often, wear pants and long sleeves, and consider treating your clothes with permethrin.\n\n\nStay safe\nManaus is fairly safe for a Brazilian city of its size. As always, deserted streets are a bad idea after dark. Avoid the east zone, it has a really bad reputation.\n\n\nGo next\nPresidente Figueiredo \u2013 130 km.
