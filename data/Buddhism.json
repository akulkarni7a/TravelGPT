There is also a Buddhist diaspora spread across most of the world and a renaissance of interest in the West since the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory and philosophy\n\nBuddhism is a religion founded around 400-500 BCE by Sakyamuni Buddha. According to tradition, Prince Siddharta Gautama (the Buddha's former name) was born in Lumbini as heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Sakya (in present day Nepal, near the Indian border). He was raised in the palace with the best luxuries money can buy, but shut off from the outside world by his father, the king. One night, he sneaked out of the palace and saw four sights that had a profound impact on the rest of his life; an old man, a sick man, a dead man and an ascetic. As a result, he discovered that a life of luxury did not lead to peace of mind, and that the rich, like the poor, still suffer the torments of old age, sickness and death. He therefore renounced his titles and abandoned his wealth in order to seek a way that could lead all beings, without discrimination, to  freedom from suffering. He spent six years  experimenting with the various common methods of the day, but to no avail. Finally, at the age of 35 and while meditating under the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, he awoke to the insights he had been seeking. The essence of the Buddha's discovery are categorized in his first teaching that was delivered to a group of five ascetics at the Deer Park in Sarnath and is called the Four Noble Truths. The Buddha devoted the rest of his life to spreading his teachings, and finally passed away in a copse of sal trees at Kushinagar. He was believed to be over 80 years old at the time.\nOn the other hand, while historians generally agree that the Buddha himself was an actual historical figure, there has to date been no evidence on his actual date of birth and death, or of any of the events associated with the traditional accounts of his life story.\nFor many centuries, Buddhism was the major religion in India, and was supported by many great kings. Ashoka (273\u2013232 BCE), the third Mauryan emperor, was probably the most famous. He ruled most of the Indian subcontinent from his capital city of Pataliputra, modern day Patna. Some sources portray him as a wicked, fierce, and extremely violent monarch in the years before his conversion. Asoka embraced Buddhism and became a follower of the cause of Dharma (right behaviour, translated in Ancient Greek as \u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b5\u03af\u03b1- respect for human sufferings) after he repented, following his victory over the neighboring empire of Kalinga (modern Odisha), which was so costly in lives that it caused him to turn his back on imperialism and concentrate on bettering the world. Asoka left a large number of inscriptions on rocks and pillars, as Achaemenid rulers had in Iran. Asoka\u2019s inscriptions witness his change of heart. Almost all of the emperor's edicts deal with the Buddhist concept of Dharma. He abolished the death penalty and showed respect towards all living beings, becoming a vegetarian and saying that rearing and killing animals for food violates the Dharma cosmic law.\nAshoka's inscription in Delhi-Topra Pillar summarize his efforts for the promotion of the Dharma and the dispatch of missions which established Buddhism within his kingdom and beyond. He was responsible for the spread of Buddhism in a major way, as he is known to have sent Buddhist missionaries to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Mongolia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Syria, Iran, Egypt, Greece, Italy and Turkey. He also had stone-carved Buddhist pillars with inscriptions or animal figures erected, apparently throughout his realm \u2014 19 of these, including those at Sarnath and Prayagraj, survive to this day. Buddhism's influence in India waxed and waned over the next millennium, and during the 6th and 7th century CE support was mostly confined to Southern India. However, perhaps the single most significant blow to Buddhism in India occurred in 1193 when Turkic Islamic raiders burnt the great Buddhist center of learning in Nalanda (in current-day Bihar), and by the end of the 12th century it had all but disappeared from the lowlands, though it continued to thrive in the Himalayan regions and in what is now Sri Lanka. However, the Buddha was incorporated into the Hindu pantheon: many Hindus consider the Buddha to be an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu.\nBuddhism as a philosophy and religion can roughly be divided into two schools: Theravada and Mahayana. The Theravada school which spread to Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and the Dai ethnic minority in China promotes personal liberation from suffering, whereas the Mahayana, which is prevalent in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Vietnam emphasizes the liberation of all beings. The Vajrayana school, which is prevalent in Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia and the Russian republics of Kalmykia, Buryatia and Tuva, often called Tibetan Buddhism, is an offshoot of Mahayana and differs from it only in method, not philosophy; most adherents of Vajrayana Buddhism consider their school to be a branch of Mahayana Buddhism. Common threads throughout all Buddhist schools are the cultivation of wisdom, compassion for all living creatures and the principle of ahimsa (non-violence) as a basis of interacting with the world, and the total rejection of religious conversion. All schools of Buddhism recognize karma (the law of cause and effect) as the creator of our illusory universe, which Buddhists refer to as samsara, and reject the notion of a creator God. Buddhism generally aims to follow the \"middle path\", in which one does not go out of the way to inflict suffering on himself, but at the same time does not indulge in material pleasures. The ultimate goal in all schools of Buddhism is to attain enlightenment as the Buddha did, which is believed to be reached when one is successfully purged of all emotional attachments and selfish desires.\nFor the most part, relations between the different schools are peaceful, with no history of major armed conflict between them. It is also not uncommon for followers, or even monks of one school to visit temples belonging to other schools to study and offer prayers.\nUnlike many other religions, Buddhism does not have a holy book with the authority of the Bible in Christianity, the Koran in Islam or even the Vedas in Hinduism. The Tripitaka, also known as the Pali Canon, is generally regarded as the oldest surviving Buddhist text, and is considered canon by all schools of Buddhism. The Mahayana school also regards some additional texts, known as sutras, to be canonical. Buddhism also does not demand exclusivity, so in many places, Buddhism is syncretised with other local religions to one degree or another.\nWhile some Buddhists, such as the Tibetan Buddhists, have a hierarchy of lamas, Buddhism does not have a centralized governing body, and most Buddhists do not recognize any single pope-like figure.\n\n\nCommon images and symbols\n\nBuddha Sakyamuni. Obviously the most common image at Buddhist monasteries, and statues show the Buddha in various postures, though the most common of these depicts the Buddha sitting in lotus posture with the finger tips of his right hand touching the ground.\nPadmasambhava also known as Guru Rinpoche (only in Vajrayana monasteries, especially those of the Nyingma school). An eighth century sage credited as the founder of Vajrayana Buddhism. The most common images portray him in a sitting posture, wearing an elaborate hat and with his right leg lowered slightly. His eyes are wide open and appear to be gazing into the distance.\nPrayer wheels (Tib: mani) (only in Vajrayana monasteries). There are several types of prayer wheels, and the following are some of the most common: copper wheels mounted in walls surrounding monasteries and stupas, and large wooden wheels standing alone near the gates of monasteries. In addition, there are small hand-held wheels that are carried by devotees. All prayer wheels are rotated in a clockwise direction and with a sincere motivation to benefit all beings. In this way, they are considered an effective  means of developing a generous and pure mind.\nSwastikas. Commonly seen at temples, they are used in Buddhism to represent peace and the dharma. While the swastika is popularly associated with Nazism in much of the Western world, its use in Buddhism predates the existence of the Nazi Party by thousands of years. They continue to be used in much of Asia as a sacred symbol.\nTara (only in Vajrayana monasteries). This female deity can be depicted in a variety of colors, though green or white are the most common. Green Tara represents the Buddha's enlightened activity. White Tara represents compassion.\n\n\nFestivals\n\n\nAll traditions\nVesak (also spelled Waisak, Wesak; Sanskrit: Vaishakha; Pali: Vesakha) is the  most important of the Buddhist festivals, commemorating the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha in the Theravada tradition. In the Mahayana tradition, it commemorates the enlightenment of the Buddha, with Buddha's birthday and death anniversary being commemorated on separate days. The event is observed on the full-moon day of the lunar month \u2013 usually in April or May, except in some countries like South Korea and China where the day is fixed. The day is observed as a public holiday in many Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n\nVajrayana tradition\nNew Year \u2014 first full moon in year (usually in February).\nModlam Chenmo \u2014 8th-15th day after lunar new year.\nGuru Rinpoche's Birthday \u2014 10th day of the 6th lunar month.\nChokhor Duchen \u2014 4th day of the 6th lunar month (usually July). Celebrates the first sermon given by the Buddha Sakyamuni after enlightenment.\n\n\nTheravada tradition\nAsalha \u2014 first full moon of 8th lunar month (usually July). Celebrates the first sermon given by the Buddha Sakyamuni after enlightenment.\n\n\nMahayana tradition\nBuddha's birthday \u2014 celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th month of the Chinese calendar in the Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese tradition, on 8th April or 8th May in the Japanese tradition, and on the second Sunday of May in Taiwan.\nGuan Yin Festival \u2014 celebrated four times a year in the Chinese tradition, on the nineteenth day of the second, ninth, sixth and eleventh months of the traditional Chinese calendar, in honour of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. Many otherwise non-vegetarian Chinese Buddhists will eat only vegetarian food on these days, and Chinese Buddhist temples will often have festivities, including stalls where you can purchase vegetarian food.\n\n\nCities and other destinations\n\n\nSouth Asia\n\nBelow are listed some of the most notable Buddhist sites in the sub-continent.\nThe Buddhist Circuit is a route following the footsteps of Gautama Buddha starting from his place of birth to his place of death.\n\n\nIndia\nBodh Gaya, Bihar \u2014 the place where the Buddha Sakyamuni attained enlightenment.\nDiamond Triangle (Odisha) \u2014 A collection of Buddhist archaeological site comprising Ratnagiri, Udaygiri and Lalitgiri, along with a few minor sites.\nEllora and Ajanta, Maharashtra, India \u2014 spectacular rock-cut cave monasteries and temples, holy place for the Buddhists, Jains and Hindus.\nKushinagar, Uttar Pradesh \u2014 the site where Buddha reached Mahaparinirvana and was cremated.\nNalanda \u2014 Site of a Buddhist university that existed between  5th and 13th centuries.

People go to meditate to renew their energies, remove emotional blocks, gain an understanding of themselves, and get rid of their anxieties.\nFor example, Vipassana meditation is a practice associated with the Theravada Buddhism. The word \"Vipassana\" can be translated from the Sanskrit to mean \"clear-seeing\". Retreat centers are generally set in beautiful environments and stunning scenery. Apart from some luxury hotels in Kerala and Sri Lanka that may offer some Vipassana retreats as a complement of their Ayurveda packages, meditation centers in South and South-East Asia charge a small amount of money for the lodgings and food. Most of them usually operate on a donation basis. People who want to stay in Buddhist monasteries or meditation centers have to bring bed sheets, towels, toiletry, as they are probably not available outside of a retreat setting. Buddhist monasteries are usually set on silent mountain slopes. Although they are a great option for budget travelers, conditions can be somewhat uncomfortable for those seeking just a relaxing vacation or used to luxuries. Participants follow a prescribed code of discipline and a strict daily schedule.\nIn Theravada Buddhist societies, it is customary for men to spend a certain amount of time living as monks at least once in their lifetime. Some countries, such as Thailand and Myanmar, issue special visas for foreign men who wish to spend time living as monks and studying Buddhism at a monastery. To be eligible for such a visa, you will need to be sponsored by a monastery and approved by the relevant religious authorities. However, this is not something you can decide on a whim, as you will have to prove your sincerity to the monastery that you intend to reside in, and are required to observe a strict regimen and abstain from indulging in material pleasures during your time living as a monk. As women cannot be ordained as nuns in Theravada Buddhism, this option is not available to women.\nWhile Mahayana Buddhist societies permit women to be ordained as nuns, becoming a monk or nun is generally seen as a lifetime commitment, so there are no opportunities for people to become monks or nuns on a temporary basis. However, some Mahayana Buddhist monasteries organise temple stay programmes where their lay followers can spend some time studying Buddhism at the monastery, during which they have to follow the routines of the monks and nuns. In Japan and South Korea, some temples run temple stay programmes for tourists, but they must be willing to follow the routines of the monks and nuns, including waking up early for morning prayers and doing their share of chores, in order to participate.\nSee also\n\nMeditation in Japan\nMeditation in Thailand\nMeditation retreat centers\n\n\nBuy\nStatues of the Buddha and other sacred images are available in many stores in Buddhist areas.\nMala or beads, as aids for meditation and recitation are available at Buddhist gompas and establishments\nCloth to cover sacred objects and texts\nIncense as offering\nBooks relating to the lineage or area of Buddhism supported\n\n\nEat\n\nAlthough Buddhism does not have strict dietary laws in the same way that Judaism, Islam or Hinduism does, most Mahayana Buddhist sects require their monks and nuns to be vegetarian, and also encourage their lay followers to do the same. Many otherwise non-vegetarian Buddhists would also go on a vegetarian diet for specific Buddhist festivals.\n\nBuddha's delight, a traditional Chinese Buddhist vegetarian dish\nVegetarian cuisine, served in Mahayana Buddhist monasteries to monks and visitors. May include mock-meat made from soy or wheat gluten.\nMany East Asian countries have restaurants serving Buddhist vegetarian cuisine, which in addition to being meat-free, must also be free of the \"five pungent vegetables\", namely onion, garlic, chives, spring onion and leeks. In Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, these are believed to have aphrodisiac effects and hence, inhibit one's ability to meditate on the dharma. In Japan and South Korea, this type of cuisine is usually served in specialist fine dining establishments and hence very expensive. On the other hand, in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam and Singapore, options run the gamut from cheap and hearty street food to over the top luxury, and numerous options between those too.\n\n\nDrink\nMost Buddhist establishments are well catered for tea drinking\n\n\nSleep\nMany Buddhist temples accommodate guests who desire the serenity and contemplation of a temple environment. However, guests who choose this option are often required to book in advance, and usually required to follow a strict routine and show sufficient respect for the temple grounds.\n\n\nLearn\nBuddhist temples and meditation centers welcome people of all faiths. They exist not only in Buddhist countries but in many large cities and some smaller cities in many other countries including those in North America and Europe.\n\n\nStay safe\nBecause Buddhism is not a very common religion in Western countries, there are many scams that prey on tourists' lack of knowledge of Buddhist customs. Here are some points to take note of so you can avoid a few of the common scams.\n\nMonks do not sell religious items. Temple shops selling religious items are always staffed by laymen and not monks.\nMahayana Buddhist monks do not go on alms rounds. Instead, they would either grow their own food or buy it using temple donations. Most of them are also required to be vegetarian.\nTheravada Buddhist monks are not allowed to touch money, and offering money to a monk is considered to be disrespectful. Alms bowls are solely for the purpose of collecting food.\nTheravada Buddhist monks only collect alms in the morning, and are not allowed to eat after noon. They are also not allowed to choose their food, and are required to eat whatever has been offered to them.\nTemples will have donation boxes for followers to place their monetary donations. Temples do not use high-pressure tactics to solicit donations, and will leave it entirely up to an individual to decide whether or how much they wish to donate.\nYou may be invited to pay for releasing caged birds or other animals, a practice known as \"life release\" and meant to generate benefit for those who pay for it. The creatures offered for release may have been caught specifically with the intention of being released again, and may have been kept in unsatisfactory conditions. Releasing non-native animals into the environment causes serious environmental damage, and participants may be prosecuted for introducing invasive species or animal cruelty.\n\n\nRespect\n\nAll Buddhist temples welcome people of all faiths, though everybody is expected to behave in a respectful manner when in the temple compounds.\n\nWear clothing that expresses respect for the sacred nature of the site. This means that your shoulders and midriff should be covered, while skirts and trousers should extend below the knee.\nGo barefoot within the main temple/stupa complex.\nIn Myanmar and Sri Lanka, you will be required to take your shoes off before entering the entire temple complex.\nIn most other countries like Thailand, Vietnam and Japan, you will only be required to take your shoes off before entering temple buildings.\nCircumambulate stupas and other sacred objects in a clock-wise direction.\nTurn prayer wheels in a clockwise direction.\nPreserve the peace and tranquility.\nDo not climb onto statues or other sacred objects.\nDo not take selfies at the shrine.\nDo not sit with the soles of the feet facing either a teacher (if attending a talk/event), or a Buddha image - whether statue or picture (important in all Buddhist temples)\nDo not point at statues with your index finger. Instead, use your thumb or an open palm.\nDo not climb onto the altar to take photos with the statue, as this is considered to be very disrespectful.\n\n\nDepictions of Buddha\nIt is common for people visiting South East Asia or East Asia to buy Buddha statues, but they may not be aware of how truly important Buddha is to Buddhists. There is absolutely nothing wrong with buying a Buddha statue or having a Buddha statue in your home, but many Buddhists consider it extremely disrespectful if Buddha is depicted inappropriately in any way, shape, or form. \nTo preserve the sanctity of the Buddha Dharma, it is advisable to follow these tips with regard imagery of the Buddha and usage of the term Buddha.       \n\nDo not wear clothing with Buddha or Buddhist imagery on it; it is considered disrespectful in Theravada countries, and is illegal in Myanmar.\nDo not get tattoos of Buddha or Buddhist imagery; it is considered disrespectful in Theravada countries, and is illegal in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. However, it acceptable to have a Buddha or Buddha themed tattoo on the upper part of the torso in Vajrayana countries.\nDo not depict Buddha in an inappropriate fashion; in 2004, the poster of the movie \"Hollywood Buddha\" sparked global controversy for depicting a man sitting on the head of a Buddha statue.\nDo not use Buddha's name inappropriately or in a disrespectful way. You most certainly should not name your pet \"Buddha\" and you most certainly should not name your establishment after Buddha. Doing so can be considered demeaning to the Buddha and his teachings.\nNever put a Buddha statue in your bathroom or in a bar; neither should one be placed on the floor or with mundane objects above it. Buddhists consider this disrespectful.\nRegularly clean your Buddha statue; not doing so is disrespectful.\nNever pose for images with your back faced to a Buddha statue; it is very disrespectful. However, taking photographs of Buddha statues is fine unless there is a sign prohibiting it.\nConsider positioning your Buddha statue in such a way that it faces the front door of your house; in some Buddhist cultures this is considered auspicious.\n\n\nMonks and nuns\nTheravada Buddhist monks are forbidden from having any physical contact with the opposite sex, including their own immediate family members. Women who wish to offer food to a monk should either place it on a piece of cloth the monk will place on the ground to pick up the food, or hand it to a man to pass it on to the monk. With the exception of those in Japan, who are allowed to get married, monks of either tradition are required to abstain from any form of sexual activity.\n\n\nAddressing monks and nuns\nThe languages of Buddhist cultures often have specific forms of address and greetings for Buddhist monks and nuns.\nIn Chinese, Buddhist monks and nuns are customarily addressed as \u5e2b\u7236/\u5e08\u7236 (sh\u012bfu), and are customarily greeting with the expression \u963f\u5f4c\u9640\u4f5b/\u963f\u5f25\u9640\u4f5b (\u0112m\u00edtu\u00f3f\u00f3) while putting your palms together at chest level and fingers closed together and pointing upwards, and a slight bow of the head.\n\n\nSee also\nChristianity\nHinduism\nIslam\nJudaism\nSanamahism\nSikhism\nZoroastrianism",
