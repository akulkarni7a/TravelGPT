  "extract": "Salvador is the capital of the state of Bahia, Brazil. With a charming Old Town (a World Heritage Site), a vibrant musical scene and popular Carnaval celebrations, it is considered one of the birthplaces of Brazilian culture. Salvador is an enchanting city full of mysteries and charms. There are millions of tourists every year flocking to Salvador to enjoy its beaches. Parts are best explored on foot, such as dense historical areas including the Pelourinho and the Lacerda Lift, the first urban lift in the world, and the Mercado Central.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nIt is the biggest city in the Northeast region, and was the first capital of Brazil.\n\n\nHistory\nFounded in 1549 by the Portuguese, Salvador was the capital in the heyday of the slave trade. The legacy remains today in its large Afro-Brazilian population, and the resulting culture in many ways outshines the rest of Brazil; in music, many of the greatest names from the mid-20th century to the present hail from Salvador, such as Dorival Caymmi, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso. In literature, the late Jorge Amado was also from the region. It's a vibrant, exciting city, and its people are quite friendly.\n\n\nOrientation\nSalvador is on a peninsula on the north-east coast of Brazil which shields the large Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos (\"All Saints Bay\") from the Atlantic Ocean. The city is the third largest in Brazil, sprawling for dozens of kilometres inland from the coast. Most visitors head for the coastal neighbourhoods that cluster around where the bay meets the ocean. Salvador, Brazil has a tropical climate including rainforests and lush vegetation.\nA 100-m cliff runs along the entire bayshore, dividing the city into Cidade Alta, up on the cliff, and the Cidade Baixa down by the bay. The former features Pelourinho, the old city center that packs historical sites, colonial architecture, museums, restaurants, bars, hostels, artisanal shops, and music/dance/capoeira academies into a convenient, albeit tourist-swarmed, set of winding cobblestone streets. The latter features a commercial center with lots of bus traffic coming in from all over Salvador.\nOutside of this area, there are many beach districts that stretch from the tip of the peninsula northeast along the Atlantic coast. The Barra neighborhood at the tip of the peninsula is the main alternative jumping-off point to Pelourinho, and a little further to the northeast are the hip neighborhoods of Rio Vermelho and Amaralina, which feature a nightlife less geared to the foreign tourism industry. A decent bus ride beyond these is the neighborhood of Itapu\u00e3, which has an energetic beach side nightlife and relatively few foreign visitors. Northward from there are kilometres and kilometers of gorgeous beaches, all accessible by bus.\nThe bayshore coast north beyond Pelourinho features a more tranquil atmosphere and a locally patronized, though less scenic, beach life. The interior of Salvador is where the \"new city\" has developed, full of residential neighborhoods, shopping megaplexes, and knotted highways, all of which can be quite alienating without actually having a friend to show you around.\nLocal residents enjoy sharing their exotic dancing and music skills with tourists. Residents are also considered some of the friendliest people on the planet.Tourist are welcomed with open and friendly arms by the majority of local residents.\n\n\nPeople\nPeople of Salvador, as other people from the state of Bahia, have a reputation of being relaxed, easygoing, and fun-loving, even by Brazilian standards, and of leading a \"slow life\". It's questionable whether this reputation is true, as the hectic behavior of pedestrians and drivers in traffic does not seem to be typical of \"slow\" or \"relaxed\" people. Regardless, few soteropolitanos (natives of Salvador) seem to bother with this reputation, even the bad part of it, and some even make fun of their own supposed laziness. Also, most people in Brazil agree that soteropolitanos are generally friendly and warm people.\nAs a former African slave port, Salvador inherits a massive social inequality with notable racial tones, with a wealthy minority being mostly white and often living in gated communities, and the majority of people being relatively poor and mostly black or mixed. The city's highly famous Carnival has been a subject of controversy, with many criticising the lack of participation of locals in the event (as they can rarely afford the expensive tickets), and others remarking the importance of the event to the city's tourism and economy.\n\n\nClimate\n\nWith a tropical climate and year-round sunny weather, temperatures in Salvador do not vary much. In summer, average maximum temperatures reach 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) and in winter, temperatures are between 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) and 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). However, humidity can give a greater thermal sensation than that. If you go swimming, the sea also has a pleasant average temperature of 27 \u00b0C (81 \u00b0F) all year round. With lots of sun and heat throughout the year, your concern as a tourist will just escape the rainy season, which lasts from April to June in Salvador.\nWith over 2,400 hours of sunshine a year, it's essential to use sunscreen in this sunny city.\n\n\nGet in\n\n \n\n\nBy plane\n1 Salvador's Deputado Luis Eduardo Magalh\u00e3es International Airport (SSA  IATA). is one of Brazil's main airports. All of the biggest Brazilian airlines have flights to the Bahian capital city. The city also receives flights from the main hubs of Europe, South America and the United States.   \nScheduled airlines:\n\nLATAM (all Brazil,Miami and Buenos Aires).\nGol (all Brazil, Buenos Aires and Ros\u00e1rio).\nAzul Linhas A\u00e9reas (Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista, Paulo Afonso, Ilh\u00e9us, Porto Seguro, Teixeira de Freitas, Len\u00e7\u00f3is, Recife, Belo Horizonte, Fortaleza, Goi\u00e2nia), Feira de Santana, Campinas and Cuiab\u00e1).\nPassaredo (Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista, Barreiras, Bras\u00edlia and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto).\nTAP (Lisbon).\nAerolineas Argentinas (Buenos Aires and C\u00f3rdoba)\nAir Europa (Madrid)\nCabo Verde Airlines (Ilha do Sal)\nCopa Airlines (Panam\u00e1 City)\nCondor (Frankfurt).\nThe airport is 28 km from the city center (via the Paralela expressway) or 32 km (via the seaside). There is a subway station easily reached by a free bus shuttle from the terminal. The subway fare is R$3.70 (including transfer to city buses). The subway is the best option to reach the city, it goes to the city center and also connects the airport directly to the main bus terminal (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Rodovi\u00e1ria). To Barra, Campo Grande or Ondina area, take the subway to Lapa Station (Line 1) and then a short bus ride (or a taxi/Uber). To Pelourinho, take the subway to Campo da P\u00f3lvora Station and then walk (around 900 meters, it's ok if you're arriving during the day) or take a taxi or Uber. To the ferry-boat terminal (to Itaparica), take the subway to Acesso Norte Station (Line 1 and 2) and then a bus towards S\u00e3o Joaquim. Two kinds of taxis are available in the airport, the executive taxis (Coometas and Comtas), and the normal taxis. Executive taxis are pre-paid, they have a table of prices rather than a meters. The other taxi option would be the normal taxis which are metered. A third option would be the executive air-conditioned minibuses which depart every 20 minutes to the Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9, in downtown near Pelourinho via the seaside, stopping at famous beaches like Ondina, Pituba, Amaralina and Itapu\u00e3, and Barra as well as stopping by Shopping Barra--an American-style shopping mall located not too far from the Farol da Barra The fare for these buses is R$4. Another option is the urban buses that go to many parts of the city, for the tourist the options are Lapa and Campo Grande buses, the best thing is ask the driver before taking an urban bus, the fare is R$3.70. There is also a shuttle service to some hotels around the city and costs R$25.00. The tickets are sold inside the arrivals area or online. To Praia do Forte, take the subway to Mussurunga Station or Rodovi\u00e1ria Station and then a bus, try to check the schedule of theses buses in advance.\n\n\nBy bus\nSalvador's long-distance bus station is in the middle of the new city, 14km from downtown. Salvador is accessible via scheduled buses from all around the country and from Paraguay. Inside the bus stations there are taxis (local taxis and executive taxis) and local buses which can all take you to many places in Salvador and the metropolitan area. Executive buses in the Iguatemi Station can be accessed from the Iguatemi Mall by way of a busy walkway. Bus travel in and out of Salvador can take a lot more time than expected.  Count on an average speed of 50-60 km/h when planning your itinerary.\n\n\nBy boat\nSalvador is a common stop on international cruise routes and was once visited by the Queen Elizabeth 2 during her sailing career. Note that the docks area can be dangerous. This area is linked to the Pelourinho historic centre by the Elevador Lacerda, and to the city by urban buses and executive buses to Iguatemi.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy foot\nThere are a number of transportation options available in Salvador, including taxis, buses and car rentals. the bus fares are quite affordable, although the taxi fares can be quite expensive if one is traveling a long distance. \nThe old city center can be easily explored on foot. To get between the upper and lower sections, take the Elevador Lacerda or the cable car, remember to take small change as the fare is just R$0.15. The streets between the two are considered dangerous even during the day.\n\n\nBy bus\nCity buses, as in other Brazilian cities, are constant and confusing. Fares are normally R$3.70, as of July 2018 (even for buses into the neighboring city of Lauro de Freitas). There is also the option of the air-conditioned executive buses for R$5. Remember to board in the back for the full-sized buses.\nKnow your landmarks and neighborhood names. Any large shopping area will have a complimentary frequented bus stop, and the major intercity terminal, Lapa, is next to Shopping Lapa.\nOther major bus terminals include: Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Iguatemi (between the Rodoviaria and Shopping Iguatemi), and Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Mussurunga (on the Paralela with buses usually connecting to Praia do Flamengo interior neighborhoods in Salvador).\nIf you are trying to make your way out of Pelourinho, you can either take the Elevador Lacerda down to the Comercio and find buses for just about every route, or walk to the Praca da S\u00e9 bus stop just south of the elevator, which has a much smaller selection of buses passing through, and many options of executive buses.\nBuses are safe to ride at night, as long as you are on a frequented (i.e. coastal) route and dress and act inconspicuously. Service stops at midnight and begins again around 04:30-05:00. There are a limited number of lines that provide night service from 00:00-04:00\nYou can find more about the Salvador bus routes and time tables one the website for the Superintend\u00eancia de Transporte P\u00fablico  (in Portuguese only).\n\n\nBy taxi\nSalvador cab drivers must be competing with those in Rio for spots on Formula 1 racing teams. They will certainly get you where you're going quicker than the bus! However, as buses stop running after midnight, do be prepared to haggle quite a bit with taxi drivers who refuse to use the meter, especially if you've decided to explore far from your bed. Executive taxis (white and blue) don't have meters, and the prices are on a table, it's more expensive than city taxis, but they are much more comfortable, they are in stops in the main shopping malls, the airport, bus station, ferry-boat station and big hotels.\n\n\nBy car\nRenting a basic car with air conditioning (and 100 km/day or km free) costs R$ 110-140 per day, plus fuel. It's not hard to find your way across Salvador avenues, but although people from Bahia have a reputation of being relaxed and easygoing, traffic is aggressive (somewhat like Rio de Janeiro), and you will frequently see drivers attempting dangerous overtakes on you. Pedestrians are also careless and unexpectedly run to cross roads and streets. If you are not used to this type of traffic, consider asking for a private driver, which is possible on many car renting agencies. Renting a car may be a good idea if you plan to visit the beaches from the northern part of Bahia, with more time flexibility than allowed by travel agencies.\n\n\nBy bicycle\nCycling is not really a good option to get around in Salvador, as there aren't enough cycleways and parking for bicycles, and drivers don't have any respect for cyclists. An exception is the cycleway along the east coast of Salvador, which runs for 12.55 km and goes from Amaralina to Piat\u00e3 beaches. Be aware that as the cycleway is not very used, a lot of pedestrians use it for walking.\n\n\nBy metro\nSalvador has a metro system consisting of two lines connecting the city center to some suburbs, the airport (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Aeroporto) and the long-distance bus terminal (Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Rodovi\u00e1ria). Pelourinho district is 900 m away from Campo da P\u00f3lvora Station. Barra area is linked by very frequent city buses from Lapa Station.\nThe subway fare is R$3.70 including two city bus transfers with the subway card (Cart\u00e3o Integra\u00e7\u00e3o - easily bought at any subway station, including the airport) or with the Salvador bus card (Salvador Card).\n\n\nSee\n\n1 Igreja de S\u00e3o Francisco, Largo do Cruzeiro de S\u00e3o Francisco, \u260f +55 71 3322 6430. One of the most important churches in barroco style around the world. \nAt the center of the Cidade Alta there are the two large squares Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9 and the Terreiro de Jesus which are connected at the corner by the cathedral. The latter is probably the most lively part of town, with food carts and stalls through the day and revealers in the evening hours.\n2 Museu Afro-Brasileiro. M-F 09:00-18:00, Sa Su 10:00-17:00. A museum that documents the slave trade and subsequent development of the city. R$ 5.   \n3 Largo do Pelourinho. A fairly small triangular plaza, is among the oldest parts of town.

In the adjacent square you can often see young men performing capoeira, the famous martial arts dance which originates from the area.   (updated Oct 2020)\n\n5 Igreja do Nosso Senhor do Bonfim. A small church located in a neighborhood to the north, is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in all of Brazil. The colorful votive ribbons or fitas of Bonfim are an easily recognizable item throughout Brazil and even beyond. Children outside the church will (for a small fee) tie them around your wrist and tell you to make a wish for each one. If the ribbon wears off naturally, the wish will come true; if you cut it off before then, it won't. You can get to Bonfim city by bus in about fifteen minutes.   (updated Oct 2020)\nAbaet\u00e9 Park \u2014 A protected state park around the lake with the same name. The lake is famous because of the stark contrast between the dark water and the very white sand dunes. There is an entertainment area with a lot of bars and live music.\n6 Solar do Unh\u00e3o. The best place in Salvador to watch the sunset. It is an old style house located at the Ba\u00eda de Todos os Santos. Inside there is a small museum (Museu de Arte Moderna) with local art pieces. Sometimes on Saturday evening there is a jazz concert. (updated Oct 2020)\n\n\nDo\nYou'll find a huge variety of things to do in Salvador. Some of the popular activities include:\n\nDay tour of Salvador - Salvador 500 years in 1 day (info: salvador-guide.basix.cc)\nSalvador Parks\nSalvador golf courses\nSalvador music festivals\nSurf trips\nParticipate at a Candombl\u00e9 ceremony. Candombl\u00e9 is an Afro-Brazilian religion that originated in Salvador and still has a significant following in Brazil. Their places of cult are called terreiros and many are open to visit. You can ask at FENACAB (Nacional de Culto Afro Brasileiro). They organise visits with a taxi for 100 Reais and have an office in Rua Portas do Carmo, 39 \u2013 1\u00ba andar (antiga Alfredo de Brito) \u2013 Pelourinho +55 71 3321 1548. http://bahia.com.br/outros_servicos/federacao-nacional-de-culto-afro-brasileiro/  Many travel agencies also organize similar visits for the same price. They are free to enter and tourists are welcome to participate, so if you know a terreiros you can also go by yourself.\nA good Brazil tour guide in Salvador, known as a guia de Salvador, will be able to show you around lots of the attractions and activities if you want to explore on your own. A good option to get a general idea and find your way around in the city is the \"Salvador Bus\", an open-top tour bus passing by the main points of interest and offering explanation on the way.\nOne of the main attractions in Salvador is the Carnaval. Salvador's giant Carnaval, the biggest of the world, according to the Guinness book of records, lasts for one week and is extremely popular with Brazilians and tourists alike. The event happens in mid-February and consists of parades, live entertainment, music, dancers and vendors. The main parades follow three circuits: one in the historic center Pelourinho (with mainly traditional groups in costumes), one on Campo Grande, where most bands play samba, and the most popular one in Barra/Ondina, where modern Brazilian Ax\u00e9 music mixes with percussion and all kinds of rhythms and styles, and the bands parade between \"Camarote\" boxes on one side and the beach on the other. Options to participate are either by watching from the camarote boxes, or purchasing an \"abad\u00e1\" shirt to join a group that accompanies one of the bands throughout the parade.\nYou can expect to have a lot of fun if you vacation in Salvador during Carnaval. Salvador also has many other attractions that tourists will find enjoyable. these include golf courses, museums and even an old 17th-century fort. Anyone wishing to visit Salvador Brazil will find their trip to be entertaining, fun and full of wonderful memories.\n\n\nGo to the beach\nVisiting a Salvador beach is a highlight for many tourists. One of the main central Salvador beaches is Porto de Barra. It was originally the site of the first settlement of European newcomers to Bahia. It can get very crowded on weekends. The north-East region of Salvador concentrates most beaches with good water quality. Flamengo and Stella Maris are the most popular beaches among tourists and upper class locals. They have excellent tourist infrastructure and rough waters excellent for surfing. Jaguaribe, Piat\u00e3 and Itapo\u00e3, with calmer waters, are mostly frequented by locals and can become quite crowded at weekends. They are a good option with you want to mix with the local population, but don't bring anything besides your clothes, sunglasses, sunscreen, and some cash, as muggings are quite common.\nThe other beaches of Salvador aren't suited for bathing, but still can be good for walking, cycling, or taking pictures. Farol da Barra has a beautiful view (specially during the sunset), but it's difficult to walk due to the rocks. \"Farol\" means lighthouse, and this beach is known for its lighthouse as well as being popular with surfers. A much safer choice is nearby Plakaford. Here the calm waters and soft sandy beaches are welcoming for families and children. In the city south, there is an array of beautiful beaches that include Tinhare and Boipeba.\nFor a nice day trip, catch the ferry to the laid-back island of Itaparica.\n\n\nBuy\nSalvador shopping is the bargain hunters paradise. There is nothing that you cannot find in a mall. If you plan to buy popular art, crafts and clothing, check the small stores at the Old Town or head to the Mercado Modelo (Model Market). Locals like to shop at American-style shopping malls:\n\nShopping Center Iguatemi\nSalvador Shopping \nShopping Barra\nShopping Itaigara\nShopping Center Lapa\nShopping Piedade\nBahia Outlet Center\nSalvador Norte Shopping\nAeroclube Shopping & Office\nThe first thing that anyone wanting to shop in Salvador should know is that it is essential to haggle. very few vendors will stick to their given price. If pushed they will always go lower. If you are looking for souvenirs you may want to check out Litoral Norte located at Rua Gregorio de Matos 30. They sell t-shirts and other items. Most will cost you no more than $5.\nIf you want local art you should visit Pelourhino. There are many galleries that double as stores. Galeria 13 at Rua Santa Isabel 13 displays work by local artists.\n\n\nEat\nBahian restaurants are considered to be among the best in Brazil. The majority of Bahia restaurants offer South American cuisine but there a few that offer other specialties. For example, the Maria Mato Mouro located at Rua 3A Ordem de S\u00e3o Francisco, Pelourinho serves a wide range of seafood dishes from all over the world although most are from South America. One of the most popular dishes is the grilled bahia fish badejo. This restaurant is open daily from noon until 1AM and offers main courses from $15 to $25. The Terreiro de Jesus is a great place to sample the local cuisine from street stalls, served by Afro-Brazilian baianas in their traditional white dresses. A must try dish is the Abara. This is a wrap with bean paste, dende oil and onions all cooked in a banana leaf with spices for flavour. if you prefer western food then you will find many fast-food places like Burger King, McDonald's, Subway or Pizza Hut. You also will find casual dinner chains like Outback Steakhouse.\nBe sure to try acaraj\u00e9, small fritters made from black-eyed peas and onions fried in palm oil slathered with spicy vatap\u00e1 (shrimp paste).These are sold by Baianas on the street.\n\n\nBudget\nAcaraj\u00e9 da Cira, Largo de Itapu\u00e3, 3249-4170.

Honorary Consulate (Does not provide consular services. Instead, Romanian citizens in need of assistance should contact the embassy in Brasilia, or the general consulate in Rio de Janeiro.) \n\n\nStay safe\nDue to high social inequality, Salvador is notorious for street crime, and for a tourist that wanders carelessly in the streets, the likelihood of a mugging or armed robbery is considerably higher than in S\u00e3o Paulo and perhaps even Rio de Janeiro. Salvador recognizes the importance of tourism to the city economy, so most important tourist sites such as Pelourinho and Mercado Modelo, as well as main popular festivals like the Carnaval, are usually heavily guarded.\nIn 2018, Salvador had 47.23 homicides per 100,000 residents, the 9th highest in the country, and the 29th highest in the world.\nPeople with darker complexions will have an advantage over those with pale skin. Blacks are likely to blend in well; other dark-skinned people may be inconspicuous in many places, but others are immediately labelled as either upper class citizens or tourists, and may be specially targeted.\nIf you are moving on foot, by bicycle, or by bus, it's best to go out during the day. Avoid bringing anything valuable, just enough to enjoy your day. The Flamengo and Stella Maris beaches are among the safest places to go during the day, and they are the best options if you just want to enjoy a good beach without much local culture. In other places, try to stay at areas guarded by police.\nAs a general rule, be suspicious if people approach you directly in a friendly way as they either want money or to sell you something. It's wise to reject an approach immediately and if necessary then think about it.\nAt night, it's better to take a cab to go out. Stay at reasonably crowded places. If you don't see other tourists where you are, then it's probably not a place you should be unless you are feeling particularly adventurous.\n\nSome areas which are strongly frequented by foreigners can become dangerous, especially at night, i.e. the Barra harbour area. Never go to the beach at night!\nThe long sloping road leading from the old town to the harbor should be avoided even during the day. Always take the elevator.\nIf you are staying in the touristic Barra area, beware of the favela near Shopping Barra, especially at night. The area just to the east toward the beach can be dangerous as well.\nBeware of vehicular traffic. Crossing the streets is always dangerous even when using a pedestrian crosswalk with the traffic light red for cars. As one member of Supergrass band once said: \"In Brazil green means go, and red means go faster!\" Start the crossing only when vehicles have already stopped.\nNever agree to share a taxi with other random people, especially if they approach you. Most likely, it's just a trap to rob you!\nWatch out for children in Pelourinho, especially on Tuesdays at the Geronimo Concert at the old church - they are reaching out for any low pockets in cargo pants!\nBe careful when walking near the Iguatemi: it is dangerous to wander there. Don't go there past 11PM, unless you are in a car or a taxicab, you will be robbed.\nIf you rented a car and stopped in a parking spot, do not stay in the car for too long. You will be a vulnerable target.\nWhen shopping always check the price first, especially if you are white and have blue or green eyes, many locals will see you complexion and feel they have the right to charge you double for services and products. Always ask for a Coupon Fiscal it ensures that the company or individual you are purchasing from pays the proper tax, and it can usually result in them \"suddenly\" giving you a 10 - 15% discount if you don't want the coupon as they have to pay 27% tax what you buy and the coupon ensures this.\nBe particularly aware of bancas and kiosks on the street as they will undoubtedly charge you more for being an estrangeiro (foreigner).\nAll the little extra money you are charged can seriously eat into your budget and leave a sour taste in your mouth as nobody likes being ripped off.\n\n\nStay healthy\nAs elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Salvador are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change frequently. On the day of your visit, check the latest weekly bathing bulletin (in Portuguese, boletim de balneabilidade) of the state's Environment Department (INEMA).\n\n\nGo next\nSalvador is the gateway to many other nearby attractions such as:\n\nPraia do Forte. Beach town with the \"Project Tamar\" turtle sanctuary.\nImbassai. Just a few kilometers further north from Praia do Forte, this relaxed village's beach lies between the sea and a river that runs parallel to the ocean for a few hundred meters. Unique panorama.\nBoipeba. A beautiful and very pleasant island.\nMorro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Very frequented island by tourists and locals, plenty of restaurants, hostels and bars. It has four beaches with translucent water.\nMassarandupi\u00f3. 90 km from Salvador, it's a true paradise, a semi-desert beach, with a small river. Walking by the beach you can reach a naturist area.\nAracaju and further north to Macei\u00f3 and Recife\nChapada Diamantina National Park",
