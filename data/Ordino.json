A little like Arinsal, Ordino has year round residents and is not purely a ski resort like Soldeu and Pas de la Casa, so if you are going skiing for the first time this could be a good place to choose as there are alternatives to skiing close-by in case you decide you don\u2019t like skiing or snowboarding. It is good for novice, intermediate and advanced skiers, who might be interested in the over 10 km of cross-country trails.\nThere is the Rose Festival (El Roser d'Ordino) in July. In August, there is a bagpipe festival in one of the weekend (usually the first weekend).\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\nHotel Arans, (+376) 835 311.\nHotel Babot.
