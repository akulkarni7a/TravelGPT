  "extract": "Le Havre is a port city at the mouth of the Seine, on the English Channel (French: Manche) in the region of Upper Normandy in France. Listed on the  UNESCO World Heritage Site for its reconstructed city centre, Le Havre is challenging its reputation as an industrial city. It is a city full of contrasts, which should be explored to discover its particular charm. \n\n\nUnderstand\nLe Havre, originally le Havre de Gr\u00e2ce (Harbour of Grace), was founded in the early 16th century at the mouth of the Seine as the main harbour for Paris. Goods transferred at Le Havre between ocean-going vessels and barges which went to and from Paris via the Seine.\nLe Havre was heavily bombed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944. The reconstruction of the town was undertaken by Auguste Perret using reinforced concrete. This project has led to the city being added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy train\nTrains run from Paris regularly, taking about 2 hours: most stop at Rouen en route. There is also a TGV from Marseille once a day.\n\n\nBy boat\nFerries run to Portsmouth and Newhaven in southern England daily. This service is provided by LD lines. Crossing times are from 3 hr 15 min. Popular alternative routes going to areas close to Le Havre include Newhaven to Dieppe, and Poole to Cherbourg.\n\n\nBy cruise ship\nThe cruise terminal is just south of the ferry terminal.  At the cruise terminal, you can pick up a map of the downtown city (very useful).  A shuttle bus brings you downtown in about 5\u201310 minutes (2\u00bd km).  The dropoff point is on east side of rue de Paris, just before rue Victor Hugo. From this point, you can easily move about the downtown core.\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Le Havre \u2013 Octeville Airport (LEH  IATA). Has no scheduled flights, but is still used for general aviation and the occasional charter to southern European resorts.   \nThe nearest airports offering scheduled international and domestic flights are at Deauville (DOL IATA), Beauvais (BVA IATA), and Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG IATA).\n\n\nBy car\nTraffic in the southern approach to Le Havre has benefited from the construction of the huge Pont de Normandie over the Seine estuary. However, whilst certainly impressive from an architectural standpoint, during busy summer weekends the entire structure can seem more like a car-park. Expect long delays (up to an hour) to cross the 4-km toll bridge (about \u20ac6).\nThere is an Avis car hire agency at Gare du Havre (train station), on the corner of Cours de la R\u00e9publique and Magellan Street.  From City Hall, it's a 20-minute walk (1\u00bd km) east along Boulevard de Strasbourg.\n\n\nGet around\nThe centre of town is easily covered on foot.\nA local bus service runs regularly around town.\nThe ferry port and train station are a short walk out from the centre of town and buses run on these routes.\nRent a bike for a few euros at the tourist office or at the bus parked along the beach during the season.\n\n\nSee\n\nThe view of the port (bassin du commerce) with its lovely bridge and both the Volcano and steeple of St Joseph's church in the background. Nice both in the day or at night. On the north quay, the casino (gambling, fine restaurants, hotel, spa).\nSt Vincent district is an old district near the beach which didn't suffer too much from the terrible bombings that flattened the city in 1944 and in which 5,000 people died in the ruins in a few hours. The little church and the square around it evoke a village atmosphere in southern France. During the season, painters gather on the square and give an impression of \"Montmartre\".\nTake the funiculaire (cable car) for an easy climb to Le Havre's upper plateau. From the H\u00f4tel de Ville (City Hall), it\u2019s a 7-minute walk (600 metres) along avenue Ren\u00e9 Coty to the lower terminal is located on rue Gustave-Flaubert (corner rue du Docteur-Vign\u00e9). A one-way ticket costs \u20ac0.40. Once at the top, turn right from the upper terminal (heading east), along rue F\u00e9lix-Faure, another 7-minute walk (500 metres) brings you to a superbly panoramic view of the beautiful city and its harbour. You can return down the Escalier Olivier-Senn, then stroll through narrow historic streets, zig-zagging back to the city center. Returning to the lower terminal takes about 12 minutes, all downhill.\n1 Saint-Joseph church (\u00c9glise Saint-Joseph), Boulevard Fran\u00e7ois Ier. St Joseph's Church was a key project designed by August Perret in the rebuilding of the city. Its tall tower is lined with coloured glass lending the interior a unique tranquility. (updated Aug 2016)\n2 Town Hall (H\u00f4tel-de-ville). The town hall is situated on one of the largest squares in France. The interior has information on the city. It is possible to climb the tower for view of the lay out of the city. Showflat, designed by city designer August Perret, is now open for public viewing. (updated Aug 2016)\n3 Malraux Museum (Mus\u00e9e Malraux or MuMa), 2 boulevard Clemenceau, \u260f +33 2 35 19 62 62. M W-F 11:00-18:00, Sa Su 11:00-19:00.

(updated Aug 2016)\n7 Cathedrale Notre Dame, \u260f +33 2 32 74 04 05. Visit it and walk around it. You'll get a striking contrast between the 15th-century cathedral and the buildings constructed in the 1950s and 1960s around it. The foundations of the cathedral are lower than the other buildings because they were built on the ruins of the old town.
