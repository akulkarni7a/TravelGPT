  "extract": "Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago in Brazil and a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site. Its  pristine beaches, landscapes and wildlife attract tourists worldwide.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nThe archipelago has never been linked to the mainland. Geologically, it is the tip of a submarine volcanic formation which rises out of the deep seabed and consists of one main island and several rocks and islets. The rocks form many natural aquaria and the underwater life is diverse. Because the reefs of the South Atlantic are isolated from the Caribbean by the outflow of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers, the reef communities are very different with many endemic species.\nBathed by currents coming from Africa the waters around the islands are very clear with very good visibility even at 50 meters and have great year-round warm temperatures. Of course, you can also see the large \u201cglobal\u201d species such as manta rays, sharks, moray eels, goliath groupers, sea turtles and dolphins.\nThe island is also home to one of the largest sea bird breeding colonies in the South Atlantic.\nDiscovered by Amerigo Vespucci (1454\u20131512), Italian merchant and cartographer in 1503, the archipelago is 4 degrees south of the Equator, around 329 km (200 miles) off the northeastern coast of Brazil, north east to the city of Natal.\nDuring its 500-year history, Fernando de Noronha has been temporarily occupied by the Dutch (17th century), French (18th century) before Portugal established dominion in 1737. They built an extensive defense system of 10 forts. The largest and best conserved fortress is Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios de Fernando de Noronha.\nThe island also served as a prison and a US Army base. Today the population is around 3,500 and the main industry is tourism.\nAs a unique ecological sanctuary, Fernando de Noronha is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a large part of the area is a National Marine Park. And it has the most wonderful beaches. Three (Sancho, Porcos and Le\u00e3o) regularly feature in Brazil's top beaches list.\nBeing a small island with limited water resources and a fragile ecosystem, there is a maximum number of 460 visitors allowed on the island. Visitors also pay an Environmental Preservation Tax that increases progressively with the length of the visit.\nThe relative isolation from the mainland, the limits on visitors and the preservation make Fernando de Noronha an expensive destination. But the \"happy few\" will be well rewarded by the delights of this island paradise and its fascinating underwater world.\n\n\nGet in\nAll visitors to Fernando de Noronha must pay a local government environmental preservation tax called the Taxa de Preserva\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental (TPA). It costs R$87.21 per day, per person as of 2022. You may pay it online or at your port of entry. This is different than the PANAMAR ticket required to access most of the island's touristic attractions (see National Maritime Park, below).\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Fernando de Noronha Airport (FEN  IATA), \u260f +55 81 3619-1311. Flight times are 1 hr 40 min from Recife (540 km) and 1 hr 10 min from Natal (350 km). Flights by Trip Airlines operate daily. There are also charters and full packages available from major Brazilian cities, available from most Brazilian travel agents.   \nFrom the airport you can take a bus, taxi, hire a golf buggy or even walk along the main road to most hotels if you are feeling adventurous.\n\n\nBy boat\nDuring high season travel operator CVC has 4-6 days cruises from Fortaleza, Natal and Recife.\n\n\nGet around\n\nThe archipelago comprises 21 islands. Only the largest of them is inhabited (pop. 3,500), and visiting the other islands requires special authorization from the environmental authority, as they are protected areas.\nThere is one road that circles the main island and connects many of its attractions. It is possible to rent a car or a buggy for about US $50 - 70 a day depending from whom you rent.  The easiest way to get around is by bus (R$ 2.85) which goes back and forth along the main road from the Port on one end of the island to Praia de Sueste on the other.  Another option is to hitchhike as almost all the local people and sometimes the odd taxi or dive truck will be happy to pick you up and give you a ride if you are going in their direction.  If you choose to hitchhike, try and learn at least some Portuguese so you can tell them where you want to go and say thank you at the end of the ride.\nTime zone is UTC-02:00 hours year-round, meaning that for most of the year it is one hour ahead of the standard time zone of coastal and most of central Brazil, and from mid-October through mid-February (Daylight Saving Time in all except the more northern Brazilian states), the same time zone.\n\n\nSee\n\nThe sunset.\n1 Sancho Bay. This is considered the most beautiful beach on the island, although the Pig Bay is considered by many as the most beautiful one. Both are side by side, and you can see both in the same day.  \nThe full moon rising from the ocean. In some areas you will be able to see the rocks under the water near the beaches at night because of the full moon.\nDolphins at the Dolphins Bay site\nSea turtles on 2 Sueste Bay (Ba\u00eda do Sueste)\n3 Two Brothers (Dois Irm\u00e3os). A rock formation \n4 Pig Bay (Ba\u00eda dos Porcos). \nUnderwater life\n\n\nNational Maritime Park\n ICMBio Ticket Office, Alameda do Boldr\u00f3, \u260f +55 81 3619-1378. 08:00-22:00. Park Map PANAMAR ticket: R$330 for foreigners, 10-day entry. (updated Jan 2022).\nMany of the touristic attractions of the main island are in a national park called PANAMAR, or Parque Nacional Marinho Fernando de Noronh\u00e3, which is administered by ICMBio. You must purchase a PANAMAR ticket from ICMBio to be in the park. Tickets are R$330 per person for foreigners. The tickets are valid for 10 days and are available for purchase online or at the ICMBio Ticket Office, located in the center of the city and at the main entrances to the park. Don't confuse this ticket with the TPA environmental tax you pay on arrival to the island (see Get in). \n\n\nSpecial reservations\nTo protect attractions with a more fragile ecosystem, reservations are required for:\n\n Morro S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 (Saint Joseph's Knob). The only other island of the archipelago you can visit. Has natural pool. Can only be accessed at low tide. Guide recommended. Guide required if tide is over 0.4 meters. 16 spots available per day. (updated Jan 2022)\n Abreu. Beautiful trail leading to natural pools. Guide optional. 24 spots available per day. (updated Jan 2022)\n Pontinha-Caieira. Moderate trail passing Pedra Alta lookout.

Guide required. 40 available per day. (updated Jan 2022)\nRules for making reservations are here. You can make reservations for these attractions up to 6 days in advance. Reservations are free with your PANAMAR ticket, but must be made in person at the main ICMBio Ticket Office at Alameda do Boldr\u00f3 from 16:00 to 19:00. Arrive early to get in line. Try to reserve the day you arrive if possible. As noted above, some of the attractions requiring reservations also require the hire of a licensed tour guide. You may find and hire your guide before or after you book your reservation.\nSnorkeling is a big attraction for most of the natural pools. However, the snorkeling rules in the Do section are actually enforced. Life jackets and a snorkeling mask are required to enter some of the pools mentioned above.\n\n\nDo\nBeaches - Fernando de Noronha is home to the top two beaches in Brazil - 1 Praia do Le\u00e3o and Ba\u00eda do Sancho. Both beaches offer crystal clear blue water with areas for swimming and snorkeling. If you decide to visit, it is a good idea to bring along your own provisions as well as an umbrella as there is no shade at Praia de Le\u00e3o and the shaded areas of Baia do Sancho quickly fill up with other visitors.\nBoat tours\nBuggy tours\nDolphin watching\nDiving - with visibility up to 50 meters, Fernando de Noronha is a Mecca for divers and snorkelers at any level of expertise. It has more than two hundred species of fish, five shark species, sea turtles and dolphins.\n Atlantis Divers, \u260f +55 84 3206-8841, info@atlantisdivers.com.br. \n Noronha Divers, \u260f +55 81 3619-1112, diversnoronha@gmail.com. (updated Mar 2017)\n \u00c1guas Claras, \u260f +55 84 9647-8107. \nKayak tours\nSnorkeling - Despite what several of the travel guide books say, snorkeling at Praia da Atalaia is no longer unrestricted. If you wish to visit to see the tide pool, it is recommended that you arrive early as the number of visitors is restricted to 100 per day. The tide pool is 45-60 cm (18-24 inches) deep but contains a remarkable diversity of animals. Lobsters, octopuses and numerous fish species inhabit the pool and, if you are lucky, maybe a baby shark. The tidal pool is monitored by the government of the island. If you choose to go keep in mind a few things:\nVisitors are not allowed to wear suntan lotion as the oils from the lotion will pollute the tidal pool (this is another good reason to go early in the morning when the sun isn't too hot)\nYou are only allowed to stand or put your knees down in a small sandy area in the middle of the pool. If you are not a confident snorkeler (i.e. capable of floating on the top of the water) then do some practice at another beach before you go. They will remove you from the pool and you could be fined if you violate this rule.\nYou will be limited to 25 minutes in the pool\n Surfing, robertoflornoronha@bol.com.br. For more info, please check with the local Surf Asstn. \nSwimming\nTrekking - there are also many different trails to choose from, but some restrictions apply. Trails in the National Marine Reserve (Parnamar/FN) can only be visited with authorization and with accredited guides. Trails inside the Environment Preservation Area (Apa/FN) have free access.\n\n\nBuy\nThere is not much to buy that is unique to the island.  If you are desperate for a souvenir from the island, you could consider purchasing a souvenir to support the TAMAR/IBAMA project which is focused on turtle conservation.\n\n\nEat\nAfter a long morning of diving, nothing beats a bowl of a\u00e7a\u00ed (exotic sweet and fatty dark purple-colored Northern Brazilian fruit, usually eaten as a mashed pulp) with granola and bananas at the port.\n\nBiu Restaurant - Floresta Nova, \u260f +55 81 3619 1458.
