  "extract": "Andorra is a small, mountainous country in Western Europe, up in the Pyrenees between France and Spain. Full of beautiful mountains and charming old villages, the country thrives on tourism, mainly visitors from nearby countries who come for shopping, skiing, hiking, and banking.\n\n\nCities\n\n1 Andorra la Vella \u2014 capital of Andorra\n2 Santa Coloma d'Andorra  \u2014 south of Andorra La Vella towards the border with Spain\n3 Sant Julia de Loria \u2014 south of Santa Coloma towards the border with Spain\n4 Escaldes-Engordany \u2014 this is really an eastern suburb parish of Andorra La Vella\n5 Encamp \u2014 parish to the NE of Andorra La Vella between Engordany and Canillo on the road to France\n6 La Massana \u2014 small town and parish about 5 miles north of Andorra La Vella. You can access Arinsal - Pal ski area from it directly\n7 Ordino \u2014 northernmost and least populated parish but almost the largest by area\n8 Canillo \u2014 northeasternmost parish on the main road and border to France\n9 Arinsal \u2014 small village and ski resort in the north west\n10 Pal\n11 Pas de la Casa \u2014 a town bordering with France\n12 Soldeu\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nFor 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique co-principality ruled by the French head of state and the Spanish bishop of Urgell. In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular heads of state retained, but the Andorra government transformed into a parliamentary democracy. The French claim goes back to the Counts of Foix, whose claim passed to the Kings of Navarre, who came to be French kings in the 16th century. France abandoned the claim during the First Republic, but has continually exercised the position since the days of Napoleon, even under Republican governments. Long isolated and impoverished, mountainous Andorra achieved considerable prosperity since World War II through its tourist industry. Many migrant workers (legal and illegal) are attracted to the thriving economy with its lack of income taxes.\n\n\nEconomy\nTourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has eroded as the economies of neighbouring France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited\u2014only 2% of the land is arable\u2014and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.\n\n\nElectricity\nElectricity is supplied at 220 to 230 V 50 Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\" or the compatible, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types.\n\n\nVisitor information\nvisitandorra.com (official tourism website)\n\n\nTalk\nAndorra is the only country in the world that has Catalan as its sole official language. Street signs are in Catalan, and it doesn't hurt to learn a few words. But almost everyone speaks Spanish as well, and French and Portuguese are widely spoken too. If you plan to visit there, it would be advisable to have at least some basic skills in Spanish, since English is spoken very little, most of the time at hotels. Bus/taxi drivers, shop employees or other service personnel will hardly understand if you talk in English.\n\n\nGet in\n\nDue mainly to the mountainous nature of Andorra, there is only one road entering Andorra from France, and only one widely-used road entering Andorra from Spain. Almost all entry into the country happens at one of these two points.\nAndorra doesn't require a visa from any visitors, but because the country can only be entered from Spain or France, you'll need to enter the Schengen Area first in order to get to Andorra. See the Schengen Area entry requirements. If you intend to stay in Andorra for more than 90 days, you will need to obtain a residence permit.\nAs Andorra is not a member of the EU, everyone entering Andorra is required to go through customs controls. See the Visit Andorra web-site for more information on your duty-free allowances.\nVisitors from outside the EU should note that Andorra is not a Schengen member, and exiting France or Spain into Andorra would theoretically terminate a single-entry visa. In practice, though, immigration does not enforce this. If you have a multiple-entry Schengen visa, or can visit the Schengen Area visa-free, you can request French or Spanish border officials to stamp you out so your time spent in Andorra does not count against your time limit in the Schengen Area. Should you decide to exercise this option, ensure that you get stamped back into the Schengen Area when departing Andorra \u2013 otherwise you will be considered to have entered illegally.\nPassports are usually not stamped at the border, but if you want a stamp, you can request it from the customs officer when you enter.\n\n\nBy plane\nThere are no airports in Andorra. The nearest airport is 1 La Seu d'Urgell Airport (LEU IATA) (12 km (7.5 mi) to the south, in Spain). The airport, owned by the Government of Catalonia, has twice-weekly scheduled passenger flights from Madrid on Fridays and Sundays and occasional charter flights.   \nThe nearest larger airports are:\nPerpignan (PGF IATA) (France) 128 km (80 mi) to the east, no coach connections but you can take a Yellow train to La tour de Carol and further to l'Hospitalet.\nToulouse\u2013Blagnac (TLS IATA) (France) 196 km (122 mi) to the north. You can pre book a coach or a taxi from Toulouse Airport to all the resorts in Andorra with Sea-Lifts.\nBarcelona El Prat (BCN IATA) (Spain) 202 km (126 mi) to the south.\n\n\nBy helicopter\nTo Andorra la Vella, La Massana or Arinsal heliports, the journey from airports in Toulouse or Barcelona for a maximum of 5 passengers, takes less than an hour and costs \u20ac2500.\nSee the Heliand website for more information (click \"serveis particulars\" when it appears).\n\n\nBy train\nAndorra is the only sovereign non-island state in Europe to have never had a railway.\nWhile there are no train lines or stations in Andorra, stations near the border can be accessed easily from Barcelona, Perpignan and Toulouse. There's also a direct sleeper from Paris.\n\n2 Gare d'Andorre-L'Hospitalet (before 2008: L'Hospitalet-pr\u00e8s-l'Andorre). Despite its name, this station is not on the territory of Andorra, but rather in France, some 3 km (1.9 mi) from the border. Six trains per day run from Toulouse-Matabiau (2\u00bd hr, \u20ac23.40). There are no buses between the railway station and Andorra (June 2024). There are buses between Andorra La Vella and the border (Pas de la Casa) only. For the rest of the trip, you can use a taxi but it is recommended to pre-book it.   (updated Jun 2024)\n Puigcerd\u00e0. lies on the R3 regional line between Barcelona and Latour-de-Carol-Enveitg. Catalan: La Tor de Querol-Enveig).  See the Rodalies timetable. From Puigcerd\u00e0, you can take a bus to La Seu d'Urgell (operated by Alsa). The bus stops directly in front of the station building in Puigcerd\u00e0. From La Seu d'Urgell to Andorra la Vella, there are several companies operating, such as Hife or Camino Bus. The whole trip from Puigcerd\u00e0 to Andorra la Vella costs around \u20ac10 (June 2024) (updated Jun 2024)\n3 Gare de Latour-de-Carol-Enveitg (Catalan: La Tor de Querol-Enveig) (about 20 km (12 mi) from L'Hospitalet). This station is in France but close to the Spanish border. It is the terminus of three rail lines: suburban R3 line from Barcelona-Sants (4 daily, 3 hr, \u20ac11.20); the line from Toulouse (6 daily, 3 hr, \u20ac26.10) which runs via L'Hospitalet (30 min); and a narrow-gauge line from Perpignan (2 M\u2013F, 3 weekends, 4\u20135 hr, \u20ac27.20) (change at Villefranche Vernet les Bains). Buses also connect Latour-de-Carol with L'Hospitalet. From Latour-de-Carol, you need to get to Puigcerd\u00e0 to get to Andorra.   (updated Jun 2024)\nAs of 2024, the French Intercit\u00e9s de Nuit still serves both stations, but the network has been curtailed severely and this service could be axed in the foreseeable future, too. As with most long distance trains, early booking can net you very good deals indeed.\nFrom France, getting to Andorra by train and onward bus costs around the same as the direct bus. It is very cost-effective for holders of SNCF discount cards such as Carte 12-25 or those coming with the sleeper train from Paris. Anyone under 26 years old travelling at off-peak hours with SNCF is entitled a 25% discount (called \"D\u00e9couvert 12-25\").\nFrom Barcelona, the train-bus combination is usually cheaper than the direct bus; however, it requires two changes: one in Puigcerd\u00e0 and one in La Seu d'Urgell. Some bus companies occasionally offer group discounts. For example, a trip for 3 adults from Barcelona to Andorra costed \u20ac38 with Alsa (\u20ac12.6 per person) in May 2024, whereas a single person ticket was about \u20ac28.\nCaution: L'Hospitalet train station is in a deserted area, is often unmanned, and its rooms have restricted open hours, so in winter it's important to match connections well. If you need assistance, you may want to call the Toulouse train station at \u260f +33 8 91 67 76 77.\n\n\nBy car\n\nRoads in Andorra are generally of a good quality. Entering from the Spanish side is a relatively straightforward drive; however entering from France is a more stressful affair involving many hairpin bends. Border control officers at both sides are generally fine. Entering Andorra, you generally do not need to even stop, but you must slow down and be prepared to stop if requested. When leaving Andorra, you must stop and be prepared for delays during busy times. Fuel prices are usually lower in Andorra than France and Spain, so it's a good idea to fill up your tank before leaving the country.\nAlso beware of black ice and snow drifts as the temperature in Andorra can be much colder than at sea level. Be sure your car is in good condition.\nThe approach from the French side passes through the 2.9-km-long Tunel d'Envalira which requires a credit or debit card for payment of the fee. The amounts are: Dec\u2013Mar (Apr\u2013Nov)\n\nCars \u20ac5.60 (\u20ac4.80)\nOthers \u20ac16.70 (\u20ac10.70)\nOccasionally the road through to France can be closed in winter due to heavy snowfall and avalanche risk. Weather and road conditions may be very different on the northern slope of the Pas de la Casa than to the south.\nFrom November to April, it is necessary to have winter tyres or snow chains at hand in the car. In snowy road conditions, cars without winter tyres or snow chains fitted are not allowed to drive. This is often enforced by police checkpoints on access roads to the ski resorts and on mountain passes such as the CS-311 and the road above Pas de la Casa.\n\n\nCar rental\nThe usual car hire companies operate from locations such as 'downtown'; the desks are sometimes quiet and unmanned so it may be a good idea to book in advance on-line, your rates should still be good value.\n\n\nTaxi\nTaxi Josep provides a Mercedes Benz car and speaks many languages \u260f +376 323 111. Taxi Dom\u00e8nec Segura provides a van but does not speak English or French \u260f +34 636 490 685 (Spanish number) (Taxi Josep can arrange the ride). Payment must be in cash.\nAndy runs private transfers from Barcelona city centre and El Prat airport. Price starts at \u20ac230 to Andorra la Vella for a 4-passenger sedan.\n\n\nBy bus\nAn overview of local buses can be found at bus.ad (in Catalan) international destinations are listed at busandorra.com.\nMany coach routes serve Andorra, particularly from Spain, mainly Barcelona but also Girona, Madrid, Malaga, Lleida and Valencia.\nFlixbus stops in the towns Andorra la Vella and Sant Julia de Loria.\n\n\nFrom France\n\nToulouse is the main hub for accessing Andorra.\nAndbus runs from Toulouse's Matabiau bus station and Toulouse\u2013Blagnac airport (both 3 hr, \u20ac35). The stop at Toulouse airport is outside Arrivals, Hall B in front of door B.\n\n\nFrom Spain\nThe trip from Barcelona takes 3 hr 15 min to 4 hr, depending on the number of stops.\nAndbus connects Andorra to Barcelona's airport (\u20ac30); and Girona's bus station and airport (both around 3 hr 30 min, \u20ac32).\nAutocars Nadal also travels between Andorra and Barcelona and its airport.\nAlsina Graells has eight trips a day from Barcelona (\u20ac23 one-way and \u20ac40 round-trip).\nALSA has daily trips between Barcelona and Andorra. Bus leaves from Barcelona Nord. Tickets are (\u20ac29 one-way and \u20ac55 round-trip) but it may be possible to get a group discount (e.g. \u20ac38 for three persons, i.e., \u20ac12.6 per person) when their app offers it (May 2024).\nAs of July 2024, Directbus has 8 daily trips to Andorra from Barcelona Sants train station.  The first is at 6:15, the last at 23:45. Trips take 3 hours and cost \u20ac31.50 one-way, \u20ac52 round-trip (one bag included, additional bags extra). Most of the buses actually start at Barcelona airport T1 or T2, for a total of 3:45 and \u20ac35 one-way from T1.\n\n\nBy bicycle\n\n\nFrom Spain\nFrom La Seu d'Urgell in Spain, a 10-kilometre (6.2 mi) ride with a moderate climb of some 150 m (490 ft) of elevation leads to the border of Andorra. There is no dedicated cycle path to the border. You'd ride on the wide shoulder of a somewhat busy highway with cars passing by at a respectful distance. From the border it's another 10 km (6.2 mi) and another 150 m (490 ft) climb to the capital Andorra La Vella.\n\n\nFrom France\nWhile entering and leaving from Spain should be doable for most, the only connection with France goes across a true mountain pass. From the last village in France, L'Hospitalet pr\u00e8s-l'Andorre (bikes can be brought on the train here from Toulouse) at 1,446 m (4,744 ft) elevation, you get to climb up to Port d'Envalira pass at 2,408 m (7,900 ft) before going back down to Andorra la Vella at 1,023 m (3,356 ft). While the pass seems to be open all year, it naturally can get extremely cold up there. Bicycles do not seem to be permitted on the T\u00fanel d'Envalira which cuts through the mountain under the pass at about 2,000 m (6,600 ft) elevation.\nFor those who don't want to climb the mountain pass, the local L4 bus connects the capital Andorra la Vella and the border town El Pas de la Casa (2,080 m (6,820 ft) elevation) which is 15 km (9.3 mi) from L'Hospitalet pr\u00e8s-l'Andorre. It's usually possible to lay the bikes in the luggage compartment of the bus without a requirement for further wrapping; note that this is not a specialised storage for a bicycle and the drivers naturally take no responsibility for any damages.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nBy bus\nIf you have a few days in Andorra, then you can easily visit most of the main villages by the local bus service operated by Cooperativa Interurbana Andorrana, S.A.\nThere is a journey planner called Mou-te (iOS, Android). Tickets can also be bought directly in the app. However, there is about 30 % discount on return tickets, which can only be purchased at the driver (in cash). The app supports single tickets and passes only.\nThere are 7 main bus lines or 'l\u00ednies', and all of these pass through Andorra La Vella. The fare is between \u20ac1.85 to \u20ac6.10 one-way depending on how far you are going. Drivers provide change. For the towns nearest to Andorra La Vella, the service is very regular, and as frequent as every 10 minutes during the day. If you are travelling to outlying rural places like Canolic, there are only 2 or 3 buses per day.\nThe lines are:\n\nL1 Sant Julia de Loria - Andorra la Vella / Escaldes-Engordany\nL2 Andorra la Vella - Encamp\nLC Circular bus route within Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany\nL4 Andorra la Vella - Encamp - Soldeu - Pas de la Casa\nL5 Andorra la Vella - La Massana - Arinsal\nL6 Andorra la Vella - La Massana - Ordino\nE (express) Sant Julia de Loria - Andorra la Vella/Escaldes-Engordany\nL\u00ednea Verde is a free minibus connecting Caldea in Andorra la Vella/Escaldes-Engordany with Berenador (and Camp del Serrat). This minibus gets you closer to the UNESCO Madriu-Claror-Perafita valley as it takes you from some 1,000 m to 1,500 m above sea level.  This line is not included in the Mou-te journey planner! Instead check the timetable here or download the Ride Pingo  app, where you can also see the current position of the bus in real time.\nThere are also three night bus lines with sparse intervals:\n\nBn1 Andorra la Vella - Sant Julia de Loria (every 60 min)\nBn2 Canillo - Andorra la Vella - Canillo (every 120 min)\nBn3 Ordino - Arsinal - Andorra la Vella - Ordino (every 90 min)\n\n\nBy car\nThe roadways in Andorra are winding, congested, and small. Despite the close distances indicated on the chart, it is worthwhile to take your time. Traffic moves slowly. Many locations have narrow streets. It is crowded, particularly in and around the city. Sometimes it's challenging to locate parking.\nThe 43-km-long main route runs through Andorra. Although the road is generally in good condition, it can get very crowded, particularly near the borders. Although the highway is wide in some areas, driving through Andorra takes a while because of the towns and villages it travels through.\nIn Andorra, the top speed restriction is 90 km/h. These stretches are few and far between, and even those that do occur are not very long. Numerous roundabouts are present. Watch your mirrors because on the inside of the roundabout, locals often past sluggish tourists.\nFor Andorran travelers, rest or picnic places are few and far between. They are lacking even in places where there is room to construct them. Later on in this guide, a number of locations are recommended.\n\n\nBy taxi\nTaxi Barras \u260f +376 323743 provides local service.\n\n\nSee\n\nThreatened by seemingly unchecked development, the country's main draw is still its magnificent mountainous landscapes, offering spectacular vistas in every season. At these heights, summers are cool, making for excellent hiking conditions through the romantic green valleys. Challenging day long hikes can be had on even higher grounds, and will take you through truly memorable scenery. Don't overlook the Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley, Andorra's only UNESCO World Heritage site. Only reachable on foot, this undeveloped area is an important wildlife sanctuary and consists of forest and fields, dotted with the odd shepherd's hut. In winter, snow covers large parts of the country, changing the Alpine character into an equally beautiful stage for various winter sports.\nYet, there is more to this tiny country. There are a number of lovely historic villages, home to centuries old houses and medieval Romanesque churches and shrines along cobblestoned streets. Good places to sample some culture are  Ordino, Santa Coloma d'Andorra (home to the oldest building in the country, a 9th-century church) and Sant Julia de Loria. In between the village of Canillo and Encamp stands the shrine of the country's patroness, Our Lady of Meritxell. A 1972 fire ruined the original statue, but the excellent replica makes a fine stand-in. Les Escaldes is a good place to witness some traditional dance.\nThe country's capital, Andorra la Vella, may seem like a traffic- and shop-heavy place at first \u2013 and indeed it is. Look a little deeper, however, and you'll find the 11th-century Esgl\u00e9sia de Sant Esteve, a Romanesque church dedicated to St. Stephen. A nice piazza and the historic parliament building make for other highlights in your city explorations.\n\n\nDo\n\n\nSki resorts\nMost of these resorts were once small mountain villages which have grown due to skiing. The resorts have joined together so that your ski pass covers neighbouring areas. As a result there are now two large alpine skiing areas known as Vallnord and Grandvalira.\nVallnord covers Arcalis  and the Arinsal-Pal ski area. Arcalis is quite distant away from Arinsal-Pal but the latter have been joined up by a cable car connecting the two ski areas. The Arisnal-Pal ski area is directly accessible from La Massana right from the middle of the town. 93 km (58 mi) of trails.\nGrandvalira covers Soldeu and Pas de la Casa. The Soldeu ski area is also accessible from Encamp and Canillo. This quite cleverly has opened up these areas to cope with the influence of visitors without putting all the strain on Soldeu. It has 193 km of ski slopes between 1710\u20132640 m. The surface of grandvalira is about 1.926 H, and it's divided into 6 different areas:\n\nPas de la Casa\u2014skiing resort right on the French border.\nSoldeu\u2014skiing resort\nArcalis\u2014ski area at the head of the valley from El Serrat\nArinsal\u2014skiing resort part of the Arinsal Pal ski area. Also known as Vallnord which means Valley North in English\nPal\u2014skiing resort part of the Arinsal Pal ski area.\nArinsal-Pal -- which is two skiing areas connected by cable car.  See Arinsal and Pal.\nLa Rabassa is a cross-country (Nordic) skiing area in southern Andorra above the town of Sant Julia de Loria.\n\n\nHiking and trekking\nIf you would like more information on the mountain huts in Andorra, go to this site. Be sure to bring something other than sandals for your feet and a purse for your cellphone.\n\nAndorra is a great place for hiking. The point of departure is the town of Arinsal at the foot of the Coma Pedrosa (2,942 m/9,652 ft) and the Pic de M\u00e9d\u00e9courbe (2,914 m/9,560 ft).\n\nThe 5-day Coronallacs hiking trail starts and finishes in Escaldes-Engordany.\nMadriu-Perafita-Claror Valley - is a UNESCO site in Andorra. You can use the L\u00ednea Verde to get closer to it (see Get around by bus section)\nTreks from Arinsal (1,500 m)   -  Pic de Sanfons (2,888 m/9,475 ft, 4hr 45min, climb 1,310 m/4,298 ft, medium until the hut, difficult on the ridge). View on the Coma Pedrosa, the valley of Tor, the lakes of Baiau in Spain as well as on the Pallars mountains. Mountain hut and lake on the way. Parking at Torrent Ribal 1,580 m (5,184 ft).\nPic de M\u00e9d\u00e9courbe (2,914 m)  (4hr 30min, climb 1,335 m/4,380 ft, medium until the hut increasing to difficult on the ridge).  A classic!  Mountain hut half-way up, lakes and a breathtaking view over the valley of Arinsal, Boet and Vicdessos (France).  Parking at Torrent Ribal 1,580 m (5,184 ft). The peak is the western tripoint international boundary of Andorra, France, and Spain.\nPic de Coma Pedrosa (2,942 m) (4hr 30min, climb 1,370 m, medium until the lake, difficult on the ridge). The highest mountain in Andorra.  Mountain hut half way up, lakes.  Beautiful view of the surrounding summits, the valley of Arinsal and to the West, the Maladeta and Ecantats massifs.  Parking at Torrent Ribal  1580 m.\nMontmantell lakes and the Pic del Pla de l'Estany (2,859 m) (4hr 20min, climb 1,280 m, medium).  Mountain hut half-way up, lakes, magnificent view over the Ari\u00e8ge mountains in France and over Andorra. Parking at Torrent Ribal 1580 m.\nArinsal - Percanela - les Fonts - Pla de l'Estany - Arinsal circuit (2,055 m) (4hr 30min, climb 670 m, medium) 2 mountain huts.  Very pleasant circuit which one can do either way.  Lovely views of Coma Pedrosa via the imposing natural amphitheatre of Les Fonts.  A few bordas (farm houses) on the way, some renovated, some in ruins.  Parking at Arinsal 1,466 m.\nCam\u00ed del coll de les Cases (1,950 m) (1hr 40min, climb 490 m, medium) Panoramic view over the Ordino mountains and la Massana.  Ideal picnic and meditation site.  You can continue along the GR11 to Arans (parking at Mas de Ribafeta 1466 m) but transport back to Arinsal must be provided.\n\n\nSpa\nIn Andorra La Vella there is the famous Caldea to visit which is a spa/swimming pool complex. This is very popular. It is at the top end of Andorra-la-Vella and you cannot miss it because it is the large glass spire structure which is quite an attraction on the skyline. In the case of Caldea, it is about thermal waters that emanate from the interior of the earth at a temperature of 70\u00ba C.\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nMoney\n\nAndorra uses the euro, like several other European countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The official symbol for the euro is \u20ac, and its ISO code is EUR. There is no official symbol for the cent.\nAll banknotes and coins of this common currency are legal tender within all the countries, except that low-denomination coins (one and two cent) are phased out in some of them. The banknotes look the same across countries, while coins have a standard common design on the reverse, expressing the value, and a national country-specific design on the obverse. The obverse is also used for different designs of commemorative coins. The design of the obverse does not affect the coin's acceptability.\n\n\nShopping\nAndorra la Vella is a tax haven and thus typical duty free shopping goods, such as perfumes, cigarettes and alcohol, are popular purchases. On any given day the capital will have lots of people from Spain and France who've driven up for a shopping trip.\n\n\nEat\n\nEscudella De Pages (Catalan peasant soup) or Escudella i Carn d'Ollais is often considered the national dish. It is sometimes made with pilotas (giant spiced meatballs).\nThe Trinxat, consisting of cabbage, potato and bacon or salted pork, is the other typical dish of the country's gastronomy and that can be tasted in most of Andorra's traditional restaurants, many of which are housed in former rustic huts.\n\n\nDrink\nYou will find Estrella Damm, a beer from Barcelona, all over the country.\n\n1 Destil\u00b7leries Andorra (Destil\u00b7leries El Serrat), Urb. Els Camps, AD400, La Massana - Arinsal, \u260f +376 333 189. Producing the country's \"national spirit\", Anis Andorrana, as well as some other liqueurs, this distillery located in Arinsal offers free tours and tastings to walk-in visitors and has a factory store. Its products can also be bought at other supermarkets and liquor stores around the country. (updated Dec 2022)\nWine \u2013 The main Andorran grape varietal is pinot noir.\nAlpha Brewery  \u2013 The country's only brewery that makes a couple different styles of beer is not sold in most stores. Small gift shops and our tourist-centric businesses may have some.\n\n\nSleep\nThere are a few Andorra-based luxury hotel chains and independently operated ones at a four-star level, as classified by the local tourism board \u2013 not as good as what you'd expect from four-star hotels at other destinations.\nThe only hotels of well-known international chains are budget ones: Holiday Inn and Ibis, present in Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany (in the vicinity) respectively.\n\n\nWork\nTo work in Andorra you need to a work permit issued by the government. As Andorra is not part of the EEA, citizens of EU member states are also required to get a work permit to work in Andorra; citizens of France, Spain and Portugal get priority over other foreigners when applying for one.\n\n\nStay safe\nThere is not much threat from other people in Andorra, but keep safe on mountains. Don't go too high without knowing what you are doing. See Altitude sickness for more.\nDrivers are warned to avoid crossing back into France if the Spanish side of the Pyrenees has enjoyed beautiful warm sunshine all day and the road temperatures drop considerably towards the evening \u2013 there is danger of black ice from ice melt. The weather in the French Pyrenees is frequently vastly different than that of Andorra and the Spanish Pyrenees.  Stay overnight if necessary, as cold morning temperatures are more apparent and less treacherous than sudden evening icing. Driving can become dangerous especially in winter if you don't obey the speed limits or traffic signs due to its narrow roads, sharp turns and mountainous terrains. From November 1 to May 15, drivers are legally required to have winter tires or snow chains installed. Otherwise you will be fined \u20ac180 by the police.\n\n\nStay healthy\nThe main hospital in Andorra is the Meritxell (pronounced merichai) Hospital (+376 871 000).\nTap water is drinkable, though if you're coming from far away it's possible the local microbes and minerals may upset your stomach at first. As in many places, bottled water is safest.\n\n\nRespect\nAndorra is not part of Spain or France, and people could be offended if you say that it is.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nCellular service\nAndorra's telecom providers are not part of the EU roaming zone so turn off your cell phone if you want to avoid hefty roaming charges, unless your plan allows you to roam in Andorra. If you wish to purchase a local SIM for use during your time in Andorra, Andorra Telecom sells SIMs for \u20ac15 with \u20ac15 credit preloaded. This is enough to purchase 1.5 GB of data.\n\n\nInternet\nAndorra is a well-connected country and has accepted the Internet with open arms. Almost as many people subscribe to the Internet as landline phones. Free public WiFi is available in parts of major towns, and many restaurants have WiFi as well.\n\n\nPostal services\n\nUniquely, Andorra does not have its own postal service and instead relies on both the Spanish and French postal systems. You'll frequently see buildings with two mailboxes, and if you look closely you'll notice that one is for Correos (Spain) and one for La Poste (France). The main offices for both are in Andorra La Vella.\nHowever, regular French and Spanish postage stamps are not valid for use in Andorra, and both postal services issue special stamps for use in Andorra only. Their stamps are also not interchangeable, so stamps issued by each postal service is not valid for sending mail using the other. Letters to Spain are cheaper if you use the Spanish postal service, while letters to France are cheaper if you use the French postal service. For letters to other countries, compare prices between the two postal services before you decide.\nThe French post office (Correus francesos) is at Carrer de Bonaventura Armengol is usually open M-F 08:30-14:30, Sa 09:00-11:59 Tel: +376 820 408\nThe Spanish post office (Correus espanyols) is open M-F 08:30-14:30, Sa 09:00-12:59 Tel:  +376 820 257.\n\n\nGo next\nLatour-de-Carol - first stop on the scenic descent for Perpignan with the open-top Yellow train (fr: Le train jaune) is reachable with the same TER train line 22 that serves L'Hospitalet-pr\u00e8s-l'Andorre.",
