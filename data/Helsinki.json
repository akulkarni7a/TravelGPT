  "extract": "Helsinki (Swedish: Helsingfors) is Finland's capital and largest city. Helsinki combines modern and historic architectural styles with beautiful open spaces. The city is surrounded by hundreds of tiny islands, and is a cultural bridge between the East and West. The \"Pearl of the Baltic Sea\" is easy to explore on foot or on bike, and it has a laid-back vibe.\n\n\nDistricts\nThe city of Helsinki forms the core of Finland's largest urban area, known in Finnish as the \"capital area\" (p\u00e4\u00e4kaupunkiseutu).  Helsinki is bordered by the Gulf of Finland to the south, while the posh suburban city of Espoo, with the embedded tiny enclave city of Kauniainen, is to the west. The more industrialized city of Vantaa is to the north and east. The Capital Region has a population of about 1.2 million, 650,000 of them living in Helsinki proper. Beyond these, the suburbs rapidly give way to small towns, farms and forests, most notably Nuuksio National Park at the intersection of Espoo, Vihti and Kirkkonummi. On the eastern side, at the tri-point of Helsinki, Vantaa and Sipoo you can find the Sipoonkorpi National Park.\nHelsinki's city centre is on the southern peninsula at the end of the city's main thoroughfare Mannerheimintie (or just Mansku). The central railway station and the main bus terminal are in the city centre.  Shopping streets Aleksanterinkatu (or Aleksi for short) and Esplanadi (or Espa) connect to Senate Square (Senaatintori), the historical centre of the city. See the Helsinki Guide Map for an interactive searchable map of the city.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\nHelsinki was established as a trading town by the Swedish Empire in 1550, but it wasn't until 1812, when the Russian Empire made it the capital city of the country, that it started growing. Today, this hustling and bustling city has more than 658,000 inhabitants (2021), and it is the northernmost capital of an EU member state.\n\n\nHistory\nSee also: Nordic history\nAs Finland became part of the Swedish kingdom in the 13th century with Turku as its regional capital, Helsinki was founded in AD 1550 by King Gustav Vasa of Sweden as a trading post to compete with Tallinn to the south in Estonia, which was Danish at that time. Helsinki was established about 5 km north-east of the current centre in the area today known as Vanhakaupunki (\"the Old Town\"), at the rapids where Vantaa river (at that time known as Helsinge river) flows into the Baltic Sea, which in turn gave the city its Swedish name Helsingfors (ie. Helsinge rapids). Never becoming the trading post Gustav Vasa envisioned and largely bypassed by the King's Road \u2014 the major road along the coast at that time \u2014 the village faced some hard times during its first centuries with fires and diseases; today there is but a few stones left of the original Helsinki. Eventually the city was moved further south to its current location and in the middle of the 18th century the maritime fortress Sveaborg (nowadays Suomenlinna in Finnish) was established in the front of Helsinki. The now world heritage-listed fortress archipelago features some of the oldest standing buildings in the city.\n\nIn 1809, through the Finnish War (a part of the Napoleonic Wars), Finland was annexed by Russia and the capital of Finland moved from Turku to Helsinki in 1812, away from Sweden. The Czar felt the Grand Duchy of Finland needed a capital of grand proportions, and this was a major turning point in the history of Helsinki. The architects Johan Albrecht Ehrenstr\u00f6m, a native Finn, and Carl Ludwig Engel, from Germany, were given the task of rebuilding the city in the Empire style. This can be seen today around the Lutheran Cathedral, which was completed in 1852. The same style, and even architects, is also a part of Saint Petersburg's history.\nGrowing steadily during the 19th century, with the population exceeding 100,000 by the turn of the century, Helsinki established itself as the largest city and the political and cultural capital of the country. The city was a battleground in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, and was bombed by the Soviets in the Second World War. Until the 1950s Finland was largely an agricultural country, but the industrialisation and urbanization that happened during the following decades meant an influx of new inhabitants from the rural parts of the country and Helsinki started becoming the metropolis it is today, with suburbs, superhighways and even a small subway system. Architectonically a young city, many of the monumental buildings erected since the independence have a stark modernist style and the rest of the city's architecture is made up of National Romantic style buildings from the early 20th century and the aforementioned Empire style buildings in Central Helsinki. Though thoroughly a Nordic capital, Helsinki today reflects the influences gained from the Western and Eastern cultures.\n\n\nTourist information\n1 City of Helsinki Tourist Information Office, Corner of Pohjoisesplanadi and Unioninkatu (just off Market Square), \u260f +358 9 3101-3300, helsinki.touristinfo@hel.fi. May\u2013Sep: M\u2013F 09:00\u201320:00, Sa Su 09:00\u201318:00; Oct\u2013Apr: closes 18:00/16:00. A fount of information with helpful, multilingual staff. They also sell tickets to museums and sightseeing tours. \nThere is also another one right in the Central Railway Station.\n\n\nClimate\n\nHelsinki is among the world's northernmost capitals and the lengthy winter is dark and chilly. Winter temperatures average \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F), but the wind chill and humidity makes it feel even colder and the mercury can plunge below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) on a particularly cold day. Days are short. In general snow falls only intermittently and often melts into grey slush. However lake-effect snowfalls dropping copious amounts of snow during a few hours (and messing up the traffic) is not unheard of in the early winter. Since the Helsinki peninsula juts into the sea, there is often a cold sea wind, and the climate is more maritime than inland, with snow and \u22125 \u00b0C (23 \u00b0F) replaced by slush, sleet and 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). This is especially apparent in November and December, but the first months of the year almost always have colder temperatures and clear skies.\nThe spring brings clear skies but the temperature doesn't increase as fast as the sunshine hours; even in April you may experience sub-zero nights, even as the afternoon temperatures raise above 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). The summer is often pleasant. Daytime temperatures are usually around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) and July and August afternoons often see temperatures above 25 \u00b0C, and unlike the rest of the year you don't need a jacket or sweater even in the night. The sun sets late in the night and even then dusk turns into dawn without any real darkness in between. Parks burst into green, sunbathers dot the city's beaches and restaurants and bars deploy their terraces and patios, making the streetscape look more Central European for a couple of months. The autumn slowly develops throughout September with autumn foliage and moderate temperatures; snow and seriously cold weather before early November is very uncommon.\n\n\nTalk\nThe city is officially bilingual, with an 86% Finnish-speaking majority and a visible 6% Swedish-speaking minority. Many in the Finnish-speaking majority only know the basics of Swedish, which they learned in school, while some speak it fluently. \nMost people, especially in the younger generations, speak very good English. Although locals will appreciate an effort to say a few words in Finnish, they know very well how difficult Finnish is and will readily switch to English \u2013 many people also like the chance to practice their language skills.\nStreet signs and most other signs are usually in both Finnish and Swedish. In tourist-oriented areas, English signage is also prevalent. The Finnish and Swedish names of streets and places may differ significantly, for example Suomenlinna/Sveaborg for the fortress and Pasila/B\u00f6le for one of the train stations.\nBeing Finland's most cosmopolitan area by a fair margin, Helsinki also houses people from different parts of the world. While strolling around, you may hear people converse in Estonian, Russian, German, and Somali.\nAuthorities are required to give service in Finnish and Swedish, while many will speak English with foreigners and you may have luck with other languages. In touristy places, some staff will speak four or five languages.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nMain article: Helsinki Airport\n\nAll international and domestic flights land at the compact, modern and airy 1 Helsinki Airport (HEL IATA).   , which is in Vantaa, 20 km to the north of central Helsinki.\nThe airport is well served from across Europe, from East Asia and (in normal times) from neighbouring Russia. There are also flights from some airports elsewhere in Asia and a few airports in the USA.\nComing from across the Baltic Sea, you may also consider flying to some regional airport with budget flights, such as Turku or Tallinn, if their connections happen to suit. You can take a ferry from Tallinn or an intercity bus or train from the other cities, which generally have excellent connections to Helsinki (connecting flights are sparse, and you'd miss the city visit).\nHelsinki Airport is on a commuter train loop, with trains every 10\u201330 minutes from 04:30 until 01:15, taking about 30 min to the centre. There are buses to the centre, to Vantaa, to It\u00e4keskus (with metro connection) in the eastern suburbs, and to other cities. Taxis are available. See Helsinki Airport#Ground transportation for details.\nThere's a grocery store in the airport open 24 hr daily, like one at Elielinaukio at the north-western corner of Helsinki Central Railway Station (next to tracks 13\u201319). Shops under the railway station also have long hours.\n\n\nBy train\n\nBeing the national capital, Helsinki has direct services from all major train stations in Finland. The connections from Russia are suspended because of the Russian war on Ukraine. All long-distance trains to the city terminate at the 2 Central Railway Station.    which provides easy interchange to metro, bus, tram and local train lines. The train station offers bars, currency exchange, kiosks, fast food restaurants, luggage boxes and many other amenities, in addition to a central location. All trains except the Allegro trains to and from St. Petersburg also stop at 3 Pasila station (B\u00f6le station).   (updated Oct 2019), some 4 km north, which might be a good option if you're going elsewhere than central Helsinki. This is also where cars are loaded on trains to Lapland.\n\n\nBy car\nMotorways connect Helsinki to Turku to the west, Tampere and Lahti to the north, and to Porvoo and to Saint Petersburg in the east. The south and west of Finland are mostly surrounded by water, but you can bring your car on ferries from Tallinn (south, many daily connections), Stockholm (west, daily), or even Germany (south-west). See \"By boat\" below. There are ferries from Sweden also to Turku and Vaasa on the west coast of Finland.\n\n\nBy bus\nLong-distance national and international coaches terminate at the new underground 4 Central Bus Station (Linja-autoasema) in the basement of the Kamppi mall (Kampin Keskus). The station is adjacent to Mannerheimintie, directly connected to the Kamppi metro station and within a short walking distance from the Central Railway Station. The main connections are served both by traditional coaches and low-cost Onnibus double-deckers.\nFor travel from St. Petersburg (Russia), there are ordinary buses and minibuses. Ordinary buses are operated by Lux Express, Ecolines and Sovavto. Russian minibuses depart from the Oktyabrskaya Hotel (opposite the Moskovsky train station) around 22:00 and arrive behind Tennispalatsi at Etel\u00e4inen Rautatiekatu 8, one block away from Kamppi, early in the morning.  Departures back start around 10:00 in the morning. The minibus trip costs around \u20ac15, making this by far the cheapest option, but the buses are cramped and uncomfortable and some of them stop at numerous supermarkets on the way so that Russian passengers can go for tax-free shopping. One of the operators is Transgold.\n\n\nBy boat\nSee also: Baltic Sea ferries, Boating in Finland\n\nHelsinki is well connected with ferry services from Tallinn, Estonia, and Stockholm, Sweden, and there are limited services from Travem\u00fcnde and Rostock, Germany. Service from St. Petersburg (Russia) are suspended because of Russia's war on Ukraine. There are occasional cruises from other ports.\nFor those continuing directly from Helsinki, many coaches to elsewhere start from the port and then continue via Kamppi, possibly with a transfer.\nFerries arrive at three harbours with six terminals:\n\n5 West Harbour, Terminal 1 (L\u00e4nsisatama, Terminaali 1), Hietasaarenkuja 8. The old terminal of the western harbour nowadays only serves St. Peter Line from St. Petersburg. The terminal has luggage lockers, caf\u00e9, a trolley rental, kiosk, a restaurant, public transport ticket machine, bank and an ATM. Accessed by tram 7; tram 9 is about 500 m away. (updated Oct 2017)\n6 West Harbour, Terminal 2 (L\u00e4nsisatama, Terminaali 2), Tyynenmerenkatu 14. Opened in early 2017 on reclaimed land south of the older Terminal 1, Tallink's and Ecker\u00f6 Line's ferries from Tallinn dock here. Accessed by trams 7 and 9. (updated Oct 2017)\n7 South Harbour, Olympia Terminal (Etel\u00e4satama, Olympiaterminaali), Olympiaranta 1. West shore of the bay. Tallink Silja's overnight cruise ferries from Stockholm M/S Silja Serenade and M/S Silja Symphony dock at Olympia Terminal. The terminal has a money exchange, an ATM, luggage lockers, a trolley rental, a restaurant, kiosk, and the Silja Line service point. The terminal was built for the 1952 Olympic Games, hence the name. Trams 2 and 3 stop almost right outside the terminal. (updated Oct 2017)\n8 South Harbour, Katajanokka Terminal (Katajanokan terminaali), Katajanokanlaituri 8. East shore of the bay. Viking Line ships (M/S Gabriella, M/S Mariella, M/S Viking XPRS) arrive at Katajanokka Terminal. The terminal has a restaurant, kiosk, an ATM, a currency exchange, luggage lockers, and the Viking Line service point. The terminus of tram 5 (only operates around departures and arrivals of ferries) is in front of the terminal, while tram 4 stops a few blocks towards the centre. (updated Oct 2017)\n9 Vuosaari Harbour, Hansa Terminal (Vuosaaren satama, Hansaterminaali), Provianttikatu 5. Mainly a cargo port, but used also by Finnlines services from Travem\u00fcnde. Take bus 90 to Vuosaari and continue by metro. (updated Oct 2017)\nSee the Port of Helsinki site for the latest details.\n\n\nBy ferry from Tallinn\nThe ferry route from Tallinn, Estonia to Helsinki has upwards of 20 departures daily. Depending on the ferry, journey time is anywhere from 1\u00bd to 3\u00bd hours. Prices average \u20ac16\u201330 one way, depending on operator, season (summer costs more), day of week (Fridays and Saturdays cost more) and time of day (out in the morning and back in the evening is popular and hence more expensive). Particularly popular are day cruises, which can go for as little as \u20ac15 return. All ferries also carry cars, from \u20ac25 one way. Bicycles can be taken for around \u20ac5 one way. Bikes on car ferries must go through vehicle check-in, which closes earlier than passenger check-in, so plan for extra time.\nThe following companies operate ferries between Tallinn and Helsinki:\n\n Ecker\u00f6 Line, \u260f +372 664 6000, info.ee@eckeroline.ee. Operates only one ship, the 2000-passenger Finlandia (three times daily, travel time 2\u00bd hr). Often has cheap fares. (updated Feb 2019)\n Tallink Silja, \u260f +372 640 9808, booking@tallink.ee. Up to 6 departures daily on large Shuttles Star and Superstar (2 hr). Discounts are available to Eurail pass holders. As this company has more departures you will have more flexibility planning your day trip. (updated Mar 2015)\n Viking Line. Large Viking XPRS ferry (2\u00bd hr, 2 sailings a day). Usually cheapest. (updated Feb 2020)\nEcker\u00f6 and Viking usually have the cheaper fares, as they are more geared towards day-trippers and the party crowd who come to have a great time on board and tend to spend more in the bars, restaurants and shops on board.\n\n\nArriving by yacht\nBeware of the very busy ferry traffic, especially the fast ferries from Tallinn. Use boating routes if possible. There are guest harbours in Katajanokka in central Helsinki; Pihlajasaari and Suomenlinna in the southern islands and Iso Vasikkasaari in Espoo. If you need customs clearance you should use the customs route from Helsinki lighthouse past Harmaja to the coast guard station at Katajanokka.\n\n\nGet around\n\nAll public transport within the Capital Region is coordinated by HSL, which is divided into four zones.  Here's a rough description of the zones:\n\nZone A \u2013 Central Helsinki and as far as the tram goes.\nZone B \u2013 The rest of Helsinki minus the far eastern suburbs, and including eastern Espoo and the southern rim of Vantaa.\nZone C \u2013 The rest of Espoo and Vantaa.\nZone D \u2013 Sipoo in the east, Kerava and Tuusula in the north, Kirkkonummi and Siuntio in the west.\nTickets can be purchased from several different places \u2014 by using the preloaded travel card (see below), from R kiosks, sales points or ticket machines or in the HSL app. Tickets are not sold on board of trains, buses, or trams.  Save for trips in the D zone, only tickets for two, three or four zones are sold. The price of the ticket depends on the method of purchase. The following fares are the most common (fares given for adults, children travel for half the fare):\n\nAB, BC or D zones: \u20ac2.80 (travel card, pre-purchased from kiosks, ticket machines or in the HSL app)\nABC: \u20ac4.60 (travel card, pre-purchased from kiosks, ticket machines or in the HSL app)\nABCD: \u20ac6.40 (travel card, pre-purchased from kiosks, ticket machines or in the HSL app)\nAlternatively, you can opt for a HSL Day Ticket or the Helsinki Card (see below), both of which offer unlimited travel within the city.\nAll tickets are valid on all types of transport, and allow unlimited transfers within their validity period (between 80 min and 110 min depending on ticket) and regions. Unlike public transportation tickets in many other cities the ticket is not invalidated if you exit the vehicle before the time has expired. Children under the age of seven travel free, while tickets for children under the age of 17 are half price. \nReaders that support direct tap-and-go credit/debit card payments are set to roll out from the end of 2023.  For time being, likely the most convenient way to buy tickets is the official HSL App, which lets you pay for tickets by card, includes a handy journey planner, and does not require a Finnish phone number for registration.\nAlternatively, the Travel Card (matkakortti) is an RFID card sold at R-kioskis and HSL offices, very similar to London's Oyster card. The Travel Card costs \u20ac5 (non-refundable) and gives a discount on fares. Hold the card on the reader without pressing anything to see the remaining value or to register a transfer. A travel card for non-residents can be bought at most R-kioski stores, and can be cost-effective if you are using many single tickets (including multiple people sharing the card), or are here for 14 days and can get the 14-day season ticket for non-residents instead of weekly day passes. The travel card readers are inside buses, trams and trains, and before the platform areas for metro and Suomenlinna ferry.\nIn addition to a day ticket, you can also opt for a Helsinki Card, that also offers free admission to a number of museums and other attractions. The regular Helsinki City Card is valid for travel within the A and B zones, the more expensive Helsinki Region Card also covers the C zone.\nThe very useful HSL Journey Planner will get you from a street address, place or sight to another by suggesting possible public transport connections, covering the entire metropolitan Helsinki region. Try e.g. \"Airport\" or \"Railway station\" for place names.\nGetting around at night can be a bit tricky (or expensive), as most trains and trams stop before midnight and the buses before 02:00. A limited night bus network, all leaving from either Elielinaukio or Rautatientori next to the railway station, runs on weekends and public holidays after 02:00, at the same price as a normal ticket.\nThere are no ticket checks when getting on the metro, trains, trams or the Suomenlinna ferry, but ticket inspectors perform random checks on board. If you ride without a ticket and get caught by inspectors, you will be fined \u20ac100 plus the price of a ticket. \n\n\nBy tram\n\nFor tourists, the most convenient and scenic means of travel is the extensive tram network, though the last of the practical circular routes 7A and 7B were discontinued in August 2017.  For an up-to-date route map and additional information check out HSL's website.\nThere is also a free Helsinki Sightseeing 3T Tram Audio Guide available for downloading here. It follows the route of now-discontinued tram 3T, that you will be able to replicate by taking trams 2 and 3, transferring at the Olympiaterminaali and in Taka-T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 or on Nordensk\u00f6ldinkatu.\n\n\nBy bus\nSee also Finland#By bus.\nWhile the trams operate in the city center, buses cover the rest of the city. The main stations for northbound and eastbound buses are on the two squares adjacent to the Central Railway Station: Eliel Square (Elielinaukio) and Railway Square (Rautatientori). Westbound buses operate from the underground bus station in the Kamppi Center, adjacent to the Kamppi metro station.\nYou usually need to show you ticket to the driver (or the machine by the driver). Tickets are not sold on HSL buses since the spring of 2020.\n\n\nBy metro\n\nHelsinki's metro holds the minor distinction of being the northernmost subway system in the world with Mellunm\u00e4ki being the northernmost station. The distinct orange metro cars are worth a ride.\nWith the western extension opening in November 2017, and the second phase of it in December 2022, there are now two lines, but for the most part they run next to each other so they can be considered one single line. Both start in Espoo, M1 in Kivenlahti and M2 in Tapiola three stations along the line, proceeding through central Helsinki to the eastern suburbs. At It\u00e4keskus M1 forks south to Vuosaari and M2 north to Mellunm\u00e4ki.\n\n\nBy train\nVR's suburban trains operate north from the Central Railway Station, branching out in three directions. HSL city tickets are valid within city limits, regional tickets on suburban trains to Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen.\nAll carriages on local trains have the electronic readers which allow you to buy a fare with a travel card. Ticket sales on board trains on the HSL network have been discontinued, and you have to buy a ticket before you board the train. Some stations have ticket vending machines, or you can buy a ticket with your phone , from R-kioski kiosks, or HSL service points.\n\n\nBy ferry\nThe HSL ferry to Suomenlinna from the Market Square (Kauppatori) is a cheap and popular summer getaway. Another HSL operated ferry, mostly used only by the island's residents, leaves from the eastern end of Katajanokka. In addition, private operators provide ferries to Suomenlinna and various other islands during the summer; however, schedules can be sparse. HSL's Day Ticket and mobile-phone ticket are both valid also on the Suomenlinna ferry.\n\n\nBy taxi\n\nTaxis in Finland are expensive. As fares were deregulated in 2018, prices have risen significantly, especially in Helsinki. Taxis are now free to set the prices as they like, and at popular taxi ranks (such as the airport and the railway station), inflated prices are common. Still, prices must be told and you have to be warned if the price may turn out to be more than \u20ac100.\nComparing prices is not straight forward, as some companies have higher flag-fall price, some give more weight to time, others to distance, some have minimum prices, and a few do not use taximeters at all, but offer fixed prices. Still, the price logic has to be clearly told, with an example voyage of 10 km and 15 min in the night, which should cost about \u20ac35. If you order per app or web, you usually get a fixed-price offer based on distance and estimated time. \nDuring weekend nights and some popular events or holidays, it can be difficult to find a free taxi. Walk to the nearest taxi stand or try to book one by phone from Taxi Helsinki \u260f 0100-0700 (non-geographic number) or L\u00e4hitaksi \u260f 0100-7300 (non-geographic number) (\u20ac2+1.5/min). If it's a very busy night, try calling Taksione at \u260f +358 50-545-5454 or Kajon at \u260f 0100-7070 (non-geographic number). To pre-order a taxi for a given time, call \u260f 0100-0600 (non-geographic number) (\u20ac2.76/call+0.35/min) for Taxi Helsinki, the normal number for the others. A pre-order for a taxi should be made at least half an hour, preferably a day or two, beforehand. A pre-order fee of \u20ac7\u201314 will be added to the taxi fare with most call centres.\nDrivers are not required to pick up a person hailing them on the street. If their light is on, and they pass a person hailing them, it is usually because there is a taxi stand very near by with available taxis waiting for customers. If you are not near a taxi stand, you will very likely be able to hail a passing taxi with the light on. If the queues at night seem frustratingly long in the city centre and you are willing to walk a bit, try heading towards Hakaniementori or Lauttasaari Bridge, where you can often hail a returning taxi (however, do not bother if the light is not on).\nSome taxis are equipped with child safety seats or other special equipment, ask when booking if you need them. safety seats are legally required also in taxis for children under 3 years.\nThe biggest players are Taxi Helsinki and L\u00e4hitaksi (beware of companies using similar names).\n\n Taxi Helsinki, \u260f +358 100-0700 (extra charge?), +358 100-0600 (pre-order; \u20ac2.76/call+0.35/min).

(updated Jul 2020)\n Uber. Uber has resumed its business in the capital region after the reform. They now use licensed vehicles and drivers like everybody else, although the vehicle standard may differ more than what is otherwise common. Prices vary in unpredictable ways, but you get an offer when ordering. (updated May 2019)\n Yango. Yango is a Russian company which offers cheap fares.

The system offers 4600 bikes spread across 460 stations in Helsinki and the neighboring city of Espoo. Users may buy passes good for one day (\u20ac5), one week (\u20ac10), or the full season (\u20ac35), which provide access to the bikes.  Use of a bike for up to 60 minutes is free, with increasing charges for longer rides. Avoid these charges by returning the bike to a station within the 60-minute window \u2013 and checking it out again if you wish.\nSeveral businesses also offer bicycle rentals.\nIf you bring your own bike, use City Bikes, or rent a bike, you'll find an extensive network of bike routes within the city. Cyclists are required by law to ride on the street next to cars unless a bike lane or integrated pedestrian/cyclist pavement runs next to it, and the police ticket cyclists breaking this rule. Bike lanes are clearly marked by street markings and blue traffic signs. Cycling is also allowed on pedestrian streets.\nDowntown bike lanes are typically on the pavement (instead of next to car lanes on the street) so be aware of pedestrians. Don't be afraid to ring your bell! Review your bike map carefully, as some bike routes will stop and require you to walk your bike or drive next to cars. There is also a journey planner for cycling. Once you get out of the city centre, cycling is less complicated and there are great, well-labelled paths.\nBikes can be taken on the metro and regional trains free of charge, but only if there is enough space. On buses and trams only folding bikes are allowed. Use the lifts and walk your bike on the stations.\nPublic libraries often have free biking maps for the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. If they are not visibly displayed on tables, ask for one from the staff.\nIf an ordinary bike isn't enough for you, you can also rent a cyclerickshaw (riksa) large enough for three from Riksavuokraus  (\u260f +358 50-5582525) in Eiranranta near Kaivopuisto. Prices start at \u20ac9/30 min, driver not included but available on request.\n\n\nBaana\n\nBaana \u2013 Helsinki's new \"Low Line\" (as opposed to NYC's High Line) opened on June 12, 2012, providing pedestrians and cyclists with a 1.3 km long connector from the Western Harbour area to Kamppi and T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Bay. At the Harbour end, you can see all the international cruise ships that stop in Helsinki and visit a free sightseeing terrace with MiG-21BIS fighter jet on display, at the Verkkokauppa.com electronics store. On the Kamppi end, there's bicycle hire centre and cultural activities and sights.\n\n\nBy electric kick scooter\nSee also: Finland#By motorised scooter\nIt is possible to rent Swedish Voi, German Tier, American Lime, Dutch Dott and Norwegian Ryde electric kick scooters for use in the centre.\n\n\nBy foot\n\nDon't forget walking!  The central part of Helsinki is compact and easily walkable. There is no need for public transportation in the main Kamppi\u2013Central railway station area where many attractions are, and even anywhere on the main peninsula (south of the train station) is within 30 minutes at a nice leisurely pace.\n\n\nBy car\nCar is not a particularly good way of getting around central Helsinki. If you have your own, consider not using it more than necessary. If you are going to rent a car, consider postponing it until you are going to leave the town.\nCentral Helsinki is rather difficult to get around by car due to restrictions (one-way streets etc.), and is congested in the morning 06:30\u201308:30 towards the city and in the afternoon 15:00\u201317:00 towards the suburbs \u2013 the ring roads are congested both directions at both times. For instance, if driving from Porvoo to central Helsinki at around 16:00, one can expect to spend half an hour driving 47 km to the end of the motorway and another half an hour to drive 7 km to the Kamppi centre.\nAlso parking is limited and expensive. Most street-side parking in the city centre is in \"Zone 1\" and costs \u20ac4/hour during working hours, although Saturdays (mostly) and Sundays (always) are free. There are also several large underground car parks at the Kamppi and Forum shopping centres.\n\n\nCar rental\nCars can be hired from the usual suspects.\n24Go, OmaGo and AIMO offer web or app based self-service car hire, handy for short drives. Cars can be picked up and dropped off in public car parks. You may need a driving licence recognised by their server. Any service needed (oil etc.) is probably on paid time.\n\n\nSee\nSee #Districts for listings.\nSurrounded by sea and a vast archipelago, Helsinki is at its best in the summer when the dialogue between the city and nature is at its fullest. Classical Helsinki's sights can be divided into an eclectic set of churches and a wide variety of museums.  For a coastal amble past some of Helsinki's minor and major sights, see the itinerary A seaside stroll in Helsinki.\nFor the most part, Helsinki lacks the monumental historic architecture of Copenhagen and Stockholm. However, what sets it apart from other Nordic capitals is the Russian-influenced architecture from the 19th century, which resembles that of Saint Petersburg. \n\n\nMuseums and galleries\nMany of Helsinki's museums are as interesting from the outside as from the inside.  Architecture buffs will get a kick out of Helsinki's Neo-Classical center, centered around Senate Square (Senaatintori), where a statue of the liberal Russian czar Alexander II stands guard.  Aleksanterinkatu and the Railway Station square also have some beautiful neo-classical buildings \u2013 look for the Romantic Kalevala-esque themes \u2013 but unfortunately these areas also have many concrete monstrosities mixed in.\n\n\nIslands\n\nIf you see only one place in Helsinki in the summer, make it Suomenlinna. Entry to the island is free, but you have to pay for the ferry ride.  The HSL ferry from Market Square is the cheapest and most convenient way of getting there at \u20ac9 for a 12-hour tourist return.  The ferry is a part of the Helsinki local transit system, so if you have an HSL Day Ticket it includes ferry travel. The ferry runs approximately every half hour.  On summer weekends the island is a popular picnic destination and you may have to wait for a long time as hundreds of people crowd the ferry terminal.  In this case it may be worth it to use the more expensive private ferry company at the other end of the Market Square.\nSuomenlinna is far from the only island, a beautiful archipelago (saaristo) surrounds the Helsinki city center. The major islands are Korkeasaari with the eponymous zoo, Seurasaari with its open air museum and Pihjalasaari with its beach. In addition to these, there are scheduled services to many smaller islands, and you can also tour them by sightseeing cruise. Most of the cruises depart from the Western corner of the Market Square and last from one to several hours.  Most ferries and cruises operate only in the summer high season.\n\n\nItineraries\nAlong Mannerheimintie, as the name says, what you can see if you travel the main street end to end\nA seaside stroll in Helsinki, an easy half-day walk along Helsinki's west coast\nHelsinki itineraries, several suggested itineraries for different lengths of stay\n\n\nDo\nSee #Districts for listings.\nFootball: The men's national soccer team play home games at Olympic Stadium, capacity 36,000, three km north of city centre. Helsinki has two clubs playing soccer at Bolt Arena two km north of the centre: HJK and IF Gnistan play in the Veikkausliga, the top tier. The domestic playing season is April-Oct. Helsinki Cup, the third largest international youth football tournament in Europe, is held each year in Helsinki during mid-summer.\n\n\nCinema\nThe situation with cinemas in Helsinki has deteriorated as one by one small cinemas have closed their doors.\nForeign films are mostly shown in the original language with Finnish (and usually Swedish) subtitles.\nThere are two large cinema complexes in Helsinki centre: Tennispalatsi at Salomonkatu 15, Kamppi and Kinopalatsi at Kaisaniemenkatu 2, Kaisaniemi, both run by Finnkino, the dominating cinema chain in Finland. Prices vary between \u20ac6.50 and \u20ac17.50 depending on location, time and 2D/3D.\nCinemas concentrating on classic and art house films are few and far between in Helsinki today. The cinema Orion, Eerikinkatu 15, run by the Finnish National Audiovisual Archive, displays a wide variety of films, including classics. Tickets \u20ac6 for non-members and \u20ac4.50 with a membership card. Kino Engel, Sofiankatu 4 near Senaatintori, concentrates on European and world cinema. Tickets \u20ac9. In Summers, Kes\u00e4kino (Summer Cinema) is held in the inner court of Caf\u00e9 Engel, Aleksanterinkatu 26. Tickets (\u20ac12) can be bought from the Kino Engel counter and for the same night also from the Kes\u00e4kino door 45 minutes before the screening.\nThere are also some (small) independent movie theatres in neighbouring Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen showing mainly the bigger blockbusters. Many of them have a matin\u00e9e series of cheaper, more art house screenings supported by the local culture board.\nLuckily, several film festivals enrich the cinema culture in Helsinki region. The biggest is the Helsinki International Film Festival - Love and Anarchy held annually in September. Espoo has its own international film festival Espoo Cin\u00e9 held every August in Tapiola and Lepp\u00e4vaara. In January, Helsinki Documentary Film Festival Docpoint takes over. Some of the smaller film festivals include (to name few) Lens Politica showing political films and art, and Night Visions focusing on horror, fantasy, science fiction, action and cult cinema. The Cinemania website collects at least some of the festivals together and also sells passes of 5 or 10 screenings that may be used in several festivals. However, check the site for the most up-to-date information as the ticket policy varies from festival to festival.\n\n\nConcerts\n\nHelsinki has an active cultural life and tickets are generally inexpensive.\nImportant performing groups include:\n\n Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra (Kaupunginorkesteri). Performances have moved to the Music House, a brand new visually questionable but acoustically excellent concert hall. Tickets \u20ac20. On selected Wednesdays you can go see dress rehearsals for as little as \u20ac3 per person. The rehearsals start 09:30. Check availability on the site before showing up at the Music House! \n UMO Jazz Orchestra. An important part of Finnish jazz life, known for performing new Finnish music alongside interesting shows, such as with new circus. Various venues. \n\n\nAt sea\nHelsinki is on the Finnish Gulf, and several cruise liners arrange trips out to the archipelago ranging from short hops lasting only an hour or two to trips ranging a full day.\n\n S\u00f6dersk\u00e4r Lighthouse (m/s S\u00f6dersk\u00e4r from Kauppatori or Nordsj\u00f6), \u260f +358 400-502-771, majakka@soderskar.fi.

Lux Helsinki can also be enjoyed as part of a guided walking tour. Free of charge. \n\n\nApril\n\n Vappu (Walpurgis Night). April 30-May 1. Vappu began as a north European pagan carnival, and is now an excuse for students to wear brightly colored overalls and for everybody to drink vast amounts of alcohol. At 18:00 on April 30, the statue of Havis Amanda at the Market Square is crowned with a student's cap and the revelry begins in the streets. Things can get a little ugly outside as the night wears on, so it's wiser to head indoors to the bars, clubs and restaurants, all of which have massive Vappu parties. The following morning, the party heads to the Kaivopuisto and Kaisaniemi parks for a champagne picnic, regardless of the weather. If the weather is good, up to 70,000 people will show up. Left-wing parties hold rallies and speeches, but the event is increasingly non-political. \n\n\nMay\n World Village Festival (in Finnish Maailma Kyl\u00e4ss\u00e4). An annual multicultural weekend festival in late May. The event is free to all and a meeting place offering tastes of different cultures and surprises from all over the world, music, dance, food, art, market, information.

Friday between 19 and 25 June. Although a large bonfire is lit in Seurasaari, the celebration is low key as the tradition is to celebrate \"the nightless night\" at summer cottages in the countryside. Although some celebrate Juhannus in Helsinki as well, the streets are often eerily empty and the doors of the shops closed, making it the most quiet time of year in Helsinki. \n\n\nJuly\n Teurastamo Jazz:  \u2013  July.  A jazz happening in the Teurastamo area in Helsinki with free outdoors concerts every Wednesday from June to August. (date needs fixing)\n Hori Smoku Summer Bugaloo: July.

Multi-week annual arts festival in the latter half of August. The peak of the festival is Taiteiden Y\u00f6, \"Night of the Arts\" called \"little vappu\" by many as the streets are full of revelers. The official event is marked by performing arts through the night. The Night of the Arts was first organized by local bookstores in the 1990s. It's now organized by the city. During the last few years, the event has slightly returned to its origin as an arts and culture event. \n\n\nSeptember\n Helsinki International Film Festival. Also known as Rakkautta & Anarkiaa (Love & Anarchy) and held annually in September, HIFF features a wide selection of films from all over the world. Asian films have been a special focus in the history of the festival that began in 1987.   \n\n\nNovember\n3 Lautapelaamaan, Tallberginkatu 1. 10:00-18:00 mostly.

Finns are known for their taste for liquorice flavoured with the salt ammonium chloride, popularly known as salmiak or salmiakki in Finnish, even if many foreigners may find the taste strange and even repulsive at first. Wanha Satama in Katajanokka holds an entire festival for salty liquorice candy on a weekend in middle November. More liquorice candy than you can shake a stick at, with salmiak and without. Several vendors offer their candy for sale and give you free samples. \u20ac12. \n Slush. Mid-November or early December. Big event where start-ups meet possible investors from all over the world, arranged mostly by volunteer students. Expect hotels to be sold out, and paying a premium if booking early. (updated Oct 2021)\n\n\nDecember\n\n Joulu (Christmas). In the weeks before Christmas, Aleksanterinkatu is festively lit up, the Christmas lights of the street are ceremonially lit on the last Sunday in November. The open-air Christmas market formerly held in the Esplanadi Park is nowadays held at the Senaatintori (Senate Square). The Stockmann department store sets up a Christmas themed exhibition with mechanic dolls and animals in their windows at the corner of Keskuskatu and Aleksanterinkatu. Christmas is a family event, so on the 24th, everything shuts down and stays closed until December 26. \n New Year's Eve. Dec 31\u2013Jan 1. Like in many other major cities, thousands of Helsinkians gather at Senaatintori next to the Cathedral to welcome the New Year. The event is shown on live television and there is a free outdoor concert as well. \n\n\nLearn\n\nMost of Finland's exchange students end up in Helsinki's universities.\n\n University of Helsinki (Helsingin Yliopisto). With over 40,000 students, this is Finland's largest university and the only bilingual one (Finnish/Swedish). Its alumni include Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. \n Aalto University (Aalto-yliopisto). Formed from three leading universities in their respective areas: Helsinki University of Technology (Teknillinen korkeakoulu) \u2014 Considered \"Finland's MIT\", this university is in Otaniemi, Espoo, just across the municipality border, University of Art and Design Helsinki (Taideteollinen korkeakoulu)\u2014The biggest art university in Scandinavia with the highest rate of exchange students of all Finnish universities and Helsinki School of Economics (Helsingin kauppakorkeakoulu) \u2014 The country's largest institution for university level business education. The Aalto University was named after architect and designer Alvar Aalto. \n Hanken, Swedish School of Economics and Business Administration. \n Sibelius Academy. The only music university in Finland and one of the largest in Europe. \nAs the Alexander University, now the University of Helsinki, was a legal deposit repository also during the Russian time, Helsinki has the largest collection of Russian printed material from the 19th century outside Russia. For many people, studying it here is far easier than the alternative.\n\n\nFinnish\nThe University of Helsinki offers a highly popular Finnish for Foreigners program at six different skill levels, ranging from absolute beginner to advanced courses ending with language certification. Spring and Fall classes are offered in standard 1 unit (3 hr/wk, \u20ac135) and intensive 2 unit (8 hr/wk, \u20ac310) versions.\nSummer courses on Finnish language and culture are available at the major universities including Helsinki Summer University.\n\n\nWork\nSee also: Finland#Work\n\n\nBuy\n\nSee #Districts for listings.\nShopping in Helsinki is not cheap, but fans of Finnish and Nordic design will find plenty of things of interest.  The frugal shopper can find some good bargains, particularly during the sale seasons in January and July.  If you live outside the EU and spend more than \u20ac40 on a single receipt at any participating store, you can save a pretty penny by getting a refund for the hefty 24% VAT (ALV).\nSince 2016, opening hours have been fully liberalized, but most large shops and department stores still have the normal hours: M\u2013F 09:00\u201321:00, Sa 09:00\u201318:00, Su 12:00\u201318:00. A notable exception is the Asematunneli complex, underground adjacent to the Central Railway Station, most shops here are open daily until 22:00, except on a few holidays.\nAll S-markets are open until 22:00 daily. At least the major supermarkets K-Supermarket and Lidl in the Kamppi Center (see below) are open until 22:00, and the S-Market supermarket below Sokos, next to the railway station, is open around the clock. Small grocery stores and the R-Kioski convenience store chain are open until 22:00 or 23:00 (or later). A handful of small Alepa grocery stores are open 24 hours daily. In the centre you will also find small Delish and Pick A Deli convenience stores, open 24 hours daily, but more expensive than regular grocery stores.  On holidays, many stores are closed, but at least the central S-supermarket (Sokos) and K-supermarket (Kamppi) are historically barely affected by holidays. Other centrally located small grocery stores and R-kioskis are open some hours in holidays, too.\nIn the neighbouring cities of Vantaa and Espoo you can also find big shopping malls. Vantaa has Jumbo (including Flamingo) and Myyrmanni, while Espoo has the centres of  Sello and Iso Omena.  All of these are easily accessible by public transport or by car (free parking).\n\n\nDesign\n\nThere are high-end design stores around Aleksanterinkatu and Etel\u00e4-Esplanadi.  The Design District Helsinki area around Uudenmaankatu and Iso Roobertinkatu is full of design and antique shops, fashion stores, museums, art galleries, restaurants and showrooms. Here you can find the most interesting names, classics, and trend-setters. Visit Design Forum Finland at Erottajankatu 7 to get a map of shops and galleries.\n\n\nMarkets\nMost outdoor markets in Helsinki are open only in summer, but the market halls are open all year round. They are great places to taste Finnish delicacies. The three major market halls are the Old Market Hall, Hietaniemi and Hakaniemi.\n\n\nRecords\nHelsinki has a selection of great \"underground\" record stores with a greatly varying selection of both Finnish and international music. Most of them also sell vinyl (12, 10 or 7 inch). Prices aren't cheap, but the selection may be worth it. Some of the more collectible stuff may even be cheaper than elsewhere. Price range is vinyl \u20ac20 \u00b1\u20ac5 and CD \u20ac10 \u00b1\u20ac5.\nIf you have only a limited amount of time, check out the record stores around Viisikulma, a brisk walk from the city centre.\n\n\nClothing\nIn addition to Aleksanterinkatu, various fashion boutiques can be found along Fredrikinkatu, a 10- to 15-minute walk south from the railway station. Of course you can also head to department stores and malls like Stockmann, Kamppi and Forum.\n\n\nEat\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nHelsinki has by far the most cosmopolitan eating options in Finland, with eight Michelin-starred restaurants (Palace on Etel\u00e4ranta got a second one in 2022), and is a good place to enjoy a good meal \u2013 if you can foot the bill, that is. As usual in Finland the best time to eat out if you are on a budget is lunch, when most restaurants offer lunch sets for \u20ac8\u201321. Lunch sets are typically served 10:30\u201314:00 or 11:00\u201315:00, but the times vary between venues. In the evening, only budget places are less than \u20ac10, while splurges cost well over \u20ac30 per head.  Almost every place will have at least one vegetarian option.\nA surprisingly large number of restaurants close down for a month or more in summer (July\u2013August) to give their employees vacation, so call ahead to avoid disappointment.\nBudget choices other than the lunch offers are largely limited to fast food, although there are a couple of workaday Finnish eateries in the mix.  In addition to McDonald's and its Finnish imitators Hesburger/Carrols, Helsinki is also full of pizza and kebab places, where a meal typically costs around \u20ac7\u20138 (sometimes as low as \u20ac4, especially in Kallio). \nFor lunch, a good budget option is Unicafe, a chain of restaurants owned by the Helsinki University student union, which has around 10 outlets in central Helsinki and offers full meals from \u20ac5.70, including vegetarian options (some with longer hours). There are also many other lunch restaurants for students that serve affordable food also for non-students. A good active listing of Helsinki's student restaurants and their menus as well as opening hours can be found at lunchmenu.fi. Another list of lunch restaurants in Helsinki can be found at lounaat.info.\nIn Helsinki, fine dining represents mainly pure Nordic touch with some unusual and surprising exceptions. A so called \"pure Nordic touch\" is usually represented with local products like local fresh seafood or some local vegetation. There are also other classes of fine dining that are pretty popular. For example a mixture of traditional Finnish or Nordic and something else is getting more and more attention nowadays. You can find a nice touch of French, German, Slavic and even Asian cuisine in your fine dining menu. For example a very fancy restaurant Demo is where French and Finnish cuisines are merging together, creating a \"Nordic-French\" touch. For something more different in Helsinki, try Vorschmack, an unusual but surprisingly tasty mix of minced lamb and herring, served with chopped pickles and sour cream (smetana); variants of this dish have survived also in some Eastern European countries and among Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n\nDrink\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\n\nCaf\u00e9s\n\nFinland is the largest coffee consuming nation per capita and coffee breaks are written into law. However, in Finland most coffee is filter-brewed from a light, more caffeinated, roast that is quite different to what the rest of the world drinks. Finns often enjoy a bun (pulla) or cinnamon bun (korvapuusti) with their coffee.\nIn Finland commonly espressos and lattes are called \"special coffees\" and a large number of establishments that make such coffees have popped up all over town ever since the 1990s when they arrived. One which will give any Italian cafeteria a go for their money is La Torrefazione next to Stockmann. In the more common cafeterias the normal light brew coffee is sold by self-service at the counter even at some more expensive cafeterias (there is only a handful of cafeterias serving to the table in Helsinki - this shows how commonplace coffee drinking is considered).\n\n\nBars and pubs\nHelsinki has plenty of hip places for a drink.  The main nightlife districts, all in the city center within crawling distance of each other, are around Iso-Roobertinkatu, the Central Railway Station and Kamppi. Helsinki's busy gay nightlife is centered mostly around Iso-Roobertinkatu and Eerikinkatu and surrounding streets.\nGoing out is not cheap, and complaining about the prices is a popular Finnish pastime, but compared to (say) London or New York City the prices aren't that bad. If you are on a budget and intent on getting plastered, follow the Finns and drink up a good \"base\" at home or hotel before going out on town. Alternatively, you can start the night outside the city centre area and head to the district of Kallio where bar prices are significantly lower and you can find a plethora of drinking places.\nWhile entry to bars and clubs is often (but not always) free, in club-type places and proper restaurants you must use and pay for the coat check (narikka), usually around \u20ac2, if you're wearing anything more than a T-shirt. In some places you must pay even if you don't leave anything at the cloakroom. The bouncer will be very strict with this as the much of the narikka-money goes into his pocket. If a ticket price is advertised, it usually does not cover the coat check.\nThe drinking age is 18, and this is rather strictly enforced, so bring along ID. Underaged drinking is still a huge problem, and many bars and clubs apply house limits of 20\u201324 years, but these are enforced less strictly and a patron of younger age will some times be let in if one fits the clientele, especially women.\nInformation on clubs and live performances can be found in free, Finnish-language tabloids such as City, which can be picked up at many bars, cafes and shops.\n\n\nNightclubs\nIn Helsinki, the most popular nightclubs have long queues starting to form around 23:30. Get in early to avoid standing, although it can be a nice way to meet people. After around 01:00-02:00 it might be impossible to get in anymore. You may try to just walk past the queue looking important, but a more efficient strategy is to discreetly tip the bouncer (\u20ac10-20).  The larger group you are, the more difficult things get. Look smart!\n\n\nSleep\nSee #Districts for listings.\n\nAccommodation is generally quite expensive, but of a high standard. Hotels are usually cheaper on weekends, when business travellers are away.\n\n\nBudget\nThere are quite a few budget hotels in Helsinki, the cheapest being youth hostels. Many student dormitories turn into youth hostels during the July\u2013August school break, which happily coincides with peak season for tourists. The Finnish Youth Hostel Association can provide further information.\nIn a real pinch, the (by far) cheapest option can actually be to book a \"last-minute\" or \"red-ticket\" return cabin (from around \u20ac20) on an overnight cruise to Tallinn, and spend the night (and part of the next day) on the boat, rather than sleep in the city.\n\n\nMid-range\nHotels of national and international chains usually fall in this segment. Prices are usually above \u20ac100 per night. In addition, many apartments are rented for about \u20ac90\u2013100 per night.\n\n\nSplurge\nThe upscale hotels are in the city centre and in the western parts of the city. Hotel K\u00e4mp right at the Esplanade park is definitely the most luxurious choice, and usually the place where actors, pop stars and other celebrities stay when they come to Helsinki.\n\n\nStay safe\n\nHelsinki is a safe city for its size.\nHelsinki has problems with drug trafficking and use, although this seldom affects visitors. Violent crime targeting strangers seems to be on a rise, but severe incidents are few enough to often reach the headlines.\nOn weekend nights, intoxicated people wandering around city streets may be an annoyance, especially during summer festivals and on New Year's Eve and April 30, the eve of May Day, which is the most important beer-drinking festival in the Finnish calendar. Warm summer nights always gather a drunken crowd in the centre. Intoxicated Finns tend to be rather noisy (in stark contrast to sober Finns) and admittedly sometimes picking a fight with just about anyone. Just use your common sense, and steer clear of overly loud groups of young men.\nThere are rare health hazards, although the winter weather should be borne in mind by visitors, especially those planning outdoor activities (or being out late). In midwinter the temperature can even drop to \u221225\u00b0C (\u221213\u00b0F), though this is increasingly rare. If you forget to bring winter clothing, you may want to visit local shops for appropriate apparel. Also, watch out for slippery pavements; thousands of people slip and injure themselves every winter! There are slip preventers for sale in the shoe repair shops and elsewhere.\n\n2 Yliopiston Apteekki pharmacy, Mannerheimintie 96 (Taka-T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 district), \u260f +358 300-20200. 24 hr daily.

Emergency Social Services can also be contacted by calling the emergency number 112.\n\n\nCrime\nThe crime rate in Helsinki is generally low \u2013 Helsinki being maybe one of the safest capitals in Europe \u2013 although locals grumble that things have gotten worse since the EU removed restrictions on movement, and even more so since the mid-2010s. Pickpockets target crowds and bicycles are prone to petty theft. Walking in the streets after dark is generally safe and the city centre is indeed quite lively until the early hours of the morning. However, it's best to steer clear of obviously drunk people looking to pick a fight, the traditional trouble spots being the frustratingly long queues for late night snack food or taxis. Getting mugged for money in the streets of central Helsinki is almost unheard of. Traditionally violent crime mostly takes place between people who know each other; strangers are rarely targeted. However, in the 2020s, there have been several incidents of robbery by youth gangs, which have got much publicity.\nCrimes in city centre concentrate around the central railway station and Kamppi shopping centre. The Kaisaniemi park behind the main Railway Station is possibly best avoided at night, and the area of Kalasatama, Kallio and S\u00f6rn\u00e4inen (north-east from the Pitk\u00e4silta bridge) may be somewhat rougher than other parts of the centre. There's a somewhat higher likelihood of running into people high on drugs or alcohol and intimidating and anti-social behaviour here than elsewhere in the inner city, even in broad daylight. Relatively high-crime neighbourhoods are found in the 1970s concrete-built suburbs of Eastern Helsinki, Northwestern Helsinki and Northern Helsinki, mainly in the extreme reaches of the metro and local train, such as Kontula, It\u00e4keskus, Mellunm\u00e4ki, Vuosaari along metro; Pukinm\u00e4ki, Malmi, Puistola and Kannelm\u00e4ki along local train.\n\nEspecially in the summer you will encounter Roma beggars from Eastern Europe sitting on the streets in the city centre. Most locals would prefer your not encouraging them by giving money, and donating to a charity instead.\n\n\nPedestrian safety\nIn winter, try to keep a steady footing: despite the use of vast quantities of gravel and salt, pavements can be quite slippery when the temperature hovers around zero and near-invisible black ice forms.\n\n\nExcavations\nHelsinki's bedrock is close to the surface, so new building works invariably involve some dynamite to build foundations, and it's thus quite common to hear explosions around the centre.  Blasting is often preceded by a loud sequence of warning beeps, which speed up as they count down. There is no danger to anyone, as the builders are experts (and the solid granite bedrock is very, very strong), but now you know where that \"BOOM!\" came from.\n\n\nVisa agencies\nIf you are just passing through and choose Helsinki to apply for a Russian visa, be careful when choosing a travel agency: some may charge a lot extra for \"express service\" (although applying for one yourself at the consulate will take weeks).\n\n\nRespect\n\nWhen using escalators, people in Helsinki usually reserve the right side of the moving staircase for standing and the left side for people walking up or down the stairs. Standing still on the left side will certainly make people irritated and flag you as a tourist or a fool.\nIt would be wise to use common sense when entering the metro car: do not block people when the doors open, but take one step back and let people get off first. Also, it is often customary to enter a tram from the right side of the doors while people exiting use their right side.\nAvoid walking in the cycle lane. Dedicated cycle paths are clearly marked, but sometimes run directly next to the sidewalk. Helsinki cyclists are subject to a comparatively hilly landscape and are unwilling to slow down and lose momentum. However, they are usually careful, signal clearly and use their bells, meaning that straying tourists most often are just sworn at.\nWhen waiting in lines, be patient and polite. Finns rarely cross queues but make sure you actually stand in the line. If you are not sure whether there is a queue, ask others.\nFinns usually do not address people who are doing things (in their opinion) wrong. They will just look at your foolish behavior and swear silently to themselves. You might embarrass yourself but addressing it will make an even bigger scene.\nDo not feed seagulls or pigeons (especially in the city center). Seagulls taking people's ice creams or sandwiches is a real problem in some areas, and feeding them is encouraging that behaviour. Feeding birds is also officially prohibited in many areas.\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nInternet access\nMuch of Helsinki is blanketed with Wi-Fi hotspots, and the City of Helsinki maintains a handy map. Caf\u00e9s and restaurants also often have Wi-Fi hotspots, but these are intended for paying customers.\nThere are a large number of locations in Helsinki that offer free public Wi-Fi for those needing to connect to the office while outside of the country. Many public libraries, including the Oodi central library, have computers and Wi-Fi networks so you can get online for free. If you are staying in a hotel, they usually have free Wi-Fi in the rooms and a computer in the reception for the guests.\n\n\nCope\n\n\nEmbassies\n\n  Argentina, Bulevardi 5 A 11, \u260f +358 9 4242 8700, fax: +358 9 4242 8701, embajada_efinl@mrecic.gov.ar. \n  Austria, Unioninkatu 22, \u260f +358 9 68 18 600, fax: +358 9 66 50 84, helsinki-ob@bmeia.gv.at. \n  Belarus, Unioninkatu 18, 00130, \u260f +358 9 4247 2056, finland@mfa.gov.by. \n  Belgium, Kalliolinnantie 5, 00140, \u260f +358 9 170 412, fax: +358 9 628 842, belgia@elisanet.fi. \n  Brazil, It\u00e4inen Puistotie 4 B 1 , 00140, \u260f +358 9 6841500, fax: +358 9 650084, brasemb@brazil.fi. \n  Bulgaria, Kuusisaarentie 2 B , 00340, \u260f +358 9 458 40 35, +358 9 458 40 55, fax: +358 9 458 45 50, embassy.helsinki@mfa.bg. \n  Canada, Pohjoisesplanadi 25 B , 00100, \u260f +358 9 228 530, fax: +358 9 2285 3385, hsnki@international.gc.ca. \n  Chile, Erottajankatu 11 A 17 , 00130, \u260f +358 9 612 67 80, fax: +358 9 612 67 825, info@embachile.fi. \n  China, Vanha Kelkkam\u00e4ki 9-11 , 00570, \u260f +358 9 228 90 110, +358 9 228 90 167, +358 9 228 90 129, fax: +358 9 228 90 168,  +358 9 228 90 155, consulate_fin@chinemb.fi. \n Colombia, Unioninkatu 18, 2nd fl, 00130, \u260f +358 9 615 00 172.

Accessible by bus from the city.\nPorvoo, the second oldest town in Finland is just 60 km away. It has a charming old town of wooden houses. Much more lively in the summer.\nTampere, the second largest city region in Finland, and the birthplace of Finnish industry, boasting one of the last Lenin museums left in the world as well as a spy museum. 180 km north of Helsinki, one and a half to two hours by train.\nH\u00e4meenlinna, 100 km to north is famous for the H\u00e4me castle, a large medieval castle, and the beautiful park area Aulanko. One hour by train.\nTurku, the oldest town in Finland, the main one into the 19th century, now third largest city region. The cathedral and the medieval castle are well worth visiting. Two hours by train.\nHanko, the southernmost spot in Finland, 140 km west of Helsinki. This town of less than 10,000 people is famous for its summer activities, including sandy beaches, sailing, tennis, art, theatre, etc.\nOulu, the biggest city in Northern Finland (as well as the whole Northern part of the Nordics). Known as the biking and IT capital of Finland and easily accessible from Helsinki, only an hour's flight away. Flights start from \u20ac30 if bought months in advance. The fastest day train takes 6 hours, from \u20ac25 if bought in advance, sleepers available in the overnight trains.\nAs a coastal city, Helsinki has good connections to some fine international destinations nearby:\n\nIn Russia, Saint Petersburg, \"the Venice of the North\", is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Accessible by St. Peter Line's overnight cruise ferry departing a few times a week \u2013 or by train (service suspended since 2022)\nStockholm, the Swedish capital, is somewhat like Helsinki but more Scandinavian and bigger. Accessible by Viking Line's and Silja Line's overnight cruise ferries departing late in the afternoon around the year.\nTallinn in Estonia is known for its medieval city centre and is easily accessible even as a day trip.",
