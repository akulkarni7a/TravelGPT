  "extract": "Exeter is the county town of Devon and historically the administrative capital of the south-west peninsula.  A historic mid-sized cathedral city with a good blend of arts, education, retail and history.\n\n\nUnderstand\nIn AD 50 a Roman military base was built at a strategic crossing point on the banks of the river Exe, seven years after the Roman invasion of Britain. The settlement quickly gained in importance as the administrative centre for the Dumnonii tribe once the legionnaires left. Indeed, its Roman name, Isca Dumnomiorum, means \"town of the Dumnonii (Devonian) tribe\". Parts of the original Roman walls can still be seen today. The city continued to hold regional significance through the turbulent Dark Ages, being twice captured by the invading Vikings. Following the Norman Conquest, the inhabitants rebelled against William the Conqueror, who laid siege and subsequently built Rougemount Castle to ensure future compliance. During the renaissance period it developed into an economically powerful city through the wool industry, and a period of rapid growth commenced. Later, at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, industry was driven by water power from the River Exe. It remained a significant seaport (courtesy of its Ship Canal) until the age of steam, but there was no major industrialisation in the later 19th century. The city was badly damaged in an incendiary bombing raid on the High Street and surrounding areas in 1942, and although post-war reconstruction has been limited, a number of interesting buildings remain.\nNow Exeter is the commercial and service centre for a largely agricultural hinterland, with a population of around 110,000. Good facilities for tourists exist, but tourism does not dominate; regularly voted among the top 3 cities in the UK for quality of life.\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\n1 Exeter Airport (EXT  IATA), Clyst Honiton EX5 2BD (5 miles east of town off A30), \u260f +44 1392 367433.

Loganair, a Scottish regional airline, operates from Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Newcastle upon Tyne. Ryanair and TUI Airways operate flights from the Mediterranean.\nSkybus flies from St Mary's on the Isles of Scilly (ISC IATA) March-October, Monday to Saturday.\nThe bus to the airport is Stagecoach Bus 56 between Exeter St David's railway station and Exmouth. Buses run hourly till about 10PM and take 20 min, single fare \u00a33. A taxi costs \u00a310-20.\n\n\nBy train\nExeter is on the London Paddington to Penzance line, with a train roughly every hour from Paddington to Exeter through most of the day. Alternatively, all Exeter stations (except St James's Park) are on the Riviera Line serving Starcross, Dawlish, Teignmouth, Newton Abbot, Torre, Torquay and Paignton.\nTrains run daily every two hours to Exeter from Okehampton, taking 45 min via Crediton. This \"Dartmoor Line\" closed to passenger services in 1972, remaining in use for freight and as a summer heritage railway, but in Nov 2021 it re-opened for regular trains. It's expected the service will increase to hourly early in 2022.\n\n2 Exeter St. Davids station, Bonhay Rd, EX4 4NT (a 15-minute walk or bus journey to the city centre). The main train station.
