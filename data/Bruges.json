  "extract": "Bruges (Dutch: Brugge) is a picturesque city in Flanders, the northern part of Belgium. Once Europe's richest city, it is now both cosmopolitan and bourgeois in its compact size. It is mainly known for its exceptionally well-preserved historical centre (especially by Belgian standards), which draws over 400,000 tourists annually.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nHistory\nIn the 2nd century AD there was a Gallo-Roman settlement, but the city got its foundations in the 9th century when the Vikings landed. The name Brugge indeed likely comes from the Old Norse \"bryggja\", translating to harbor or jetty, and was first mentioned between 850 and 875. During the following centuries there were strong connections to the north, and Bruges became one of the trading points of the Hanseatic League. Interestingly, the historical Hanseatic harbour of Bergen is also known as Bryggen.\nBruges became the capital of Flanders in 1089, and an 1134 storm created the tidal canal Zwin, improving the connection to the sea. As such the city developed into the economic capital of northwestern Europe in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, and this was the golden age of the city. This age saw the construction of many of the city's impressive old buildings, and its second city wall. The world's first stock exchange was formed, the Waterhalle was a lively trading place, and the city of 46,000 inhabitants was a home to painters, architects and other artists and the Duke of Burgundy set up one of his courts here.\nThe death of Mary of Burgundy in 1482 marked the beginning of the end of the golden days. The royal family soon left, nearby Antwerp became a more important trading point, silting eventually made the Zwin unusable, and the Spanish rule from 1592 to 1713 during which several wars were fought in the region all made the city one of the poorest, rather than richest cities in the region. The city changed hands between the Austrians, French and Dutch before becoming part of the independent Belgium in 1830.\nThe Industrial Revolution didn't bring much industry to Bruges. Ironically, the poverty that characterized Bruges in the 19th century is one reason the town's historic architecture is so well-preserved: there was usually simply no budget to modify the town on a large scale. However, in the 1890s two events revived interest in the city; on the cultural side the novel Bruges-la-Morte by Georges Rodenbach and on the economic side the construction of the Port of Zeebrugge, one of Western Europe's most important freight ports today. A canal from Zeebrugge to Bruges, the 12-km-long Boudewijnkanaal, was finished in 1905. Also, the 1902 art exhibition of Flemish Primitives (Early Netherlandish painting) helped re-establish Bruges as a cultural center.\nHowever, of much greater significance in shaping the town's highly touristic character, is of course the historical architecture found in virtually the entire historic city centre. Although many monuments and other buildings in the town centre have medieval origins, referring to Bruges as a 'medieval' town is inaccurate, considering most of the architecture in the historic centre dates to the 17th century and later, with many buildings (such as the old Town Hall at Burg square) having undergone serious neogothic-style renovations, chiefly under the influence of the architect Louis Delacenserie (1838-1909). Surviving both world wars mostly intact, the old town was listed as a World Heritage Site in 2000 and two years later it held the title as the European Cultural Capital.\n\n\nClimate\nEven by Belgian standards, Bruges has a poor reputation for its weather. Compared to other western European cities like London and Paris, the weather in Bruges is colder and damper. Even in July and August, average daily maximum temperatures struggle to exceed 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) and rainfall averages 203 mm (8 in) a month. In autumn, temperatures drop off quite rapidly and winter months are damp and chilly.\nThe summer visitor should always be prepared for rain in Bruges, as warm and sunny weather is not constant during that season. The daily and monthly temperature variations are quite small; average highs and average lows don't exceed a range of 9\u00b0C (or 16\u00b0F).\n\n\nTourist information\nVisit Bruges website\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy plane\nBruges shares its airport with Ostend (OST IATA). The Ostend-Bruges International Airport has a long runway and a seaside location providing for a picturesque approach, but its passenger traffic is pretty much limited to seasonal flights to holiday destinations. It is also a major hub for cargo airlines, so planespotters may find it of interest.\nMore viable as a point of entry is the Brussels National Airport (BRU IATA), Belgium's largest, as well as Charleroi (CRL IATA Brussels South) and Lille (LIL IATA), so getting to Bruges by train is by far the easiest way. Only one change at one of the three main stations is needed and the entire connection takes about 1\u00bd hr.\n\n\nBy train\n\n\nFrom Brussels\nTravelling to Bruges on Belgium's excellent rail system is a natural choice.  Trains to and from Brussels leave every 30min to 1 Brugge station  during the day. The journey from Brussel-Zuid (Dutch) or Bruxelles-Midi (French) to Bruges takes about an hour. You can also travel from Brussels-Central or Brussels-North on the same line, and trains travelling to Bruges are travelling in the direction of any coastal station except De Panne (so any train to Ostend / Oostende, Knokke or Blankenberge is fine). If you're travelling on the Eurostar that same day, this cost may be included in your ticket if it shows \"Any Belgian Station\". Otherwise, buy a ticket when you get to the station. Luggage lockers are available 06:00-22:00. For more information on schedules, prices, and services visit the website of the NMBS/SNCB. Note that there are first and second class seats. To identify them, look for a number next to a \"no smoking\" sign somewhere in the wagon. For groups of travellers under 25, a 10-ride card might be the cheapest, that offers 10 pre-paid rides between any Belgian train stations.\nBe aware that trains are often full to and from Bruges, especially during rush hours, so if you or your travel companions have any problems with mobility you could be standing the whole trip or at best sitting in the entry area of the carriage. There isn't really any solution to this during the tourist season when Bruges is wall to wall people.\n\n\nFrom Lille (France)\nFrom the train station of Lille Flanders, there are hourly trains to Bruges, but these will entail a change of train at  Cortrai/Kortrijk. One leg will be French railways (SNCF) and the other Belgian railways making it difficult to book the journeys.\nThis route will not show up on many planners but is possible.\n\n\nGeneral info\nFrom the railway station, all hotels are easily reachable on foot, it can also be done with a backpack. However, if you have a suitcase consider taking a taxi because the cobbled streets make the use of wheeled suitcases or carry-on bags very difficult. Also be sure to wear comfortable shoes, because of the cobblestones.\n\n\nBy car\nBuses and camping vehicles are not allowed within the city centre. There is a perfect parking place for them on the south side of the city with a newly designed gangway bringing you directly into the heart of the town.  It is in general a bad idea to venture inside with a car, as parking is limited and finding your way difficult. There are multi-storey car parks a five-minute walk from the city centre. Nice city mini-buses cruise the town with high frequency, and in any case, the historical centre must be traversed on foot, by bicycle, by horse-drawn carriage or by boat to enjoy it.\n\n\nBy ferry\n\nDFDS Seaways operates ferries from Dover to Dunkirk every 2 hr. From Dunkirk, Bruges is 75 km away. This can only be done by driving as they do not take foot passengers. A DFDS ferry to Amsterdam, Netherlands from Newcastle sails daily. From its port in IJmuiden, Amsterdam you can reach Bruges is less than 3 hr by car.\nStena Line Operate twice a day from Harwich to Hoek van Holland rear Rotterdam, Netherlands, foot passengers can get to/from Central Rotterdam on line B of the metro change at Beurs for main railway station on lines D & E for Rotterdam CS. Depending on the train connection you will need to change at least once and possibly up to three times! You can check the options here\nThe ferry from Kingston upon Hull to Zeebrugge was axed in 2021.\n\n\nBy cruise ship\nVirtually all dock at the major harbour of Zeebrugge.  In addition to ship's tours, most offer shuttles to Blankenberge, a nearby town offering economical, hourly train service to Bruges, which is 20 minutes or so away.\n\n\nGet around\nThe historical centre is not so big and thus quite walkable (be sure to wear comfortable shoes). The only mode of public transport inside the city is bus. They are operated by the Flemish public transport company De Lijn. They frequent nearly all major points of interest plus the train station.  Taxis on the market place and station cost about \u20ac10. Bicycles are easy to rent and make getting around the city very speedy, although the cobblestoned paths can make rides a little bumpy and uncomfortable.\n\n\nSee\nBruges was known as a \"dead city\" for centuries. The sanding of the harbour and the difficulties of digging canals in the sand caused heavy economic burdens on the city between the Middle Ages and the 20th century. The population managed to survive but did not grow as there was no new industrial activity during that period.\nAs a result, once over the encircling canal and inside the city walls, Bruges closes in around you with street after street of charming historic houses and a canal always nearby. The newly cleaned houses and the small canals should however not confuse you; they are truly centuries old. And if you can get away from the chocolate shops, you can visit some more quiet areas such as St. Anna, and imagine what life in the late Middle Ages must have been like. The historic centre of Bruges and its belfry are  UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nSeveral youth hostels, and probably the train station and tourist information offer a useful map with some very interesting, 'non-tourist' places to see during the day and some unique places to visit at night. It provides a good way of getting an authentic feel for the town whilst avoiding the tourist hotspots and allows you to find some hidden gems.\nSome highlights:\n\n1 Grote Markt. The market square is the heart of the old town. It covers an area of 1 ha, and on its southern edge is the city belfry (Halletoren/Belfort), which is one of the city's best known landmarks. There are nice views from the tower (see Do below) (updated Jul 2020)\n2 Groeninge Museum, Dijver 12. Daily 09:30-17:00.

It houses a relic: a vial of blood that is said to be that of Jesus - and was built in the Gothic style. Try and get there early so you can view the chapel when it is quiet and not filled with tourists. And don't forget to visit the chapel underneath, in heavy Romanesque style - a contrast to the lovely light Gothic above. Free.

A history of the brewery is provided, as well as an overview of the city from its tower. The tour lasts for 45 min and is a good way to get a feel for Belgian beer making. The tours start at the exact turn of the hour, be at least 15 minutes early as there is a maximum number of people that can join. The entrance price includes one drink of Brugse Zot or Straffe Hendrik and is served after the tour at the outside terrace or indoor bar. There is a longer version of the tour available at weekends. \u20ac16 including 1 beer booked on-line. (updated Sep 2024)\n5 2-be Beer Wall and Bar, Wollestraat 53. On the court of a former major's house, \"all Belgian beers\" are exposed permanently. At the back of the wall, it's also possible to drink a lot of those beers. \n\n6 Onze Lieve Vrouwkerk, Mariastraat. A fascinating church with architecture from the Romanesque and Gothic periods. In the east end of the church are very fine tombs of Charles the Bold and his daughter Mary of Burgundy, in contrasting Gothic and Renaissance styles, despite their superficial similarity. The church also houses one of the few Michelangelo sculptures outside of Italy, the \"Madonna with child\". To see the \"Madonna with Child\" an entrance fee of \u20ac5 for 18-26, \u20ac6 for 26-64, \u20ac5 for over 65, and under 17 is free.

A house, an open studio where thoughts and ideas are born, a place where Beelprez can mix these thoughts and feelings in a symbolic language of forms, her soul, her calligraphy, her world, her language.

M-Sa 10:00 - 17:00. In a quiet area of the city, a highly unusual church with octagonal tower built by the Adornes brothers, merchants of Italian extraction. It includes a fine black Tournai marble tomb, late Gothic stained glass, and a tiny and rather spooky chapel containing an effigy of the dead Christ. The entrance fee also covers the Lace Museum in the former Adornes mansion, where you can see local women and girls learning this traditional craft. Adult \u20ac8. \n\n9 The Beguinage (Begijnhof). In the history, many women couldn't find a man, as men were more likely to die in accidents or in a war. Those women could \"marry God\" and become a beguine. The beguinage, also known as the convent, offered protection for those single ladies. It lies between the centre of the city and the station, with white painted small houses and fine plane trees, is a quiet place to walk; groups are discouraged.   \n10 The Hospital of St John, Mariastraat 38. Tu-Su 09:30-17:00.

This museum is a must-see for chocolate enthusiasts as it describes chocolate's transition from cocoa into chocolate. Its low-cost tasty exhibits make it well worth the time (and Belcolade's gently overt marketing). Be sure to stay for the chocolate making exhibition to get some excellent samplers. Recommend buying tickets online ahead of time. On a Sunday in October 2022 they didn't have room for walk ins, you needed to buy tickets a few hours ahead of time. \u20ac14.   (updated Sep 2024)\n12 Diamond Museum (Diamantmuseum), Katelijnestraat 43, \u260f +32 50 336326. 10:30-17:30. Diamond museum has a large range of exhibits ranging from mining all the way to polishing and all the history in between. Everyday at 12:15 there is a live polishing demonstration. Adult \u20ac12, student \u20ac10.50. (updated Sep 2024)\nBruges is visited by a huge number of tourists and it sometimes becomes quite annoying, especially around the Markt and Burg squares. Very few tourists venture far away from the main shopping area, so if you want some peace and quiet you should explore the many small cobbled streets away from the main squares.\n\n13 Lucifernum (Retsin's lucifernum), Twijnstraat 6-8 (city centre). Su 18:00-21:00. An amazing (private) art gallery with a Gothic cemetery in a subtropical garden located in the old Freemasons temple (1756-1882). 1,000 m\u00b2 of art and mystery in Bruges' old city centre. \u20ac6. \n\n\nCity gates\n\n14 Kruispoort (Cross Gate), Langestraat. Part of the second city ramparts of 1297. The current gate dates back to the beginning of the 15th century.  \n15 Smedenpoort (Blacksmith's Gate), Smedenstraat. The first gate was built in 1297-1299 but was rebuilt in 1376-1378. After that there were several changes to the building. The gate is completely surrounded by water. A renovation in 2009 made the gate look shining again.  \n16 Ezelpoort (Donkey Gate), Ezelstraat. Just like the Smedenpoort, this gate is completely surrounded by water. Nowadays the gate is only used by pedestrians and cyclists. The gate previously also was called the Oostendsche Poort (Ostend Gate) since the road through the gate lead to Ostend.  \n17 Gentpoort (Ghent Gate), Gentpoortstraat. One of the four remaining city gates of the second city ramparts of 1297.

No old-fashioned tour focussing solely on historical details, but engaging stories to bring the history to life. Reservations advised. Tell Me About Bruges | The Original Free Walking Tour, daily at (10:00), 11:00, 14:00 & (17:00) (operated in English and Spanish). Bruges at Night: Untold Stories & (Haunted) History | Alternative Free Tour, selected days at 20:00. Pay-what-you-want. (updated Oct 2023)\n2 Bruges Ballooning, Markt, \u260f +32 47 597 2887.

You can also rent right at the train station and get to the city centre quickly; remember to return them by 19:30. Cycle 5 km to Damme, a picturesque village on the river with a windmill and excellent pancakes, and optionally follow on to the coast (another 15 km). \u20ac8 for 4 hr at most places, \u20ac12 for the day. \n Running. If you are a runner, try running the 7-km circle around the old centre. Walk along the canal and see all of the medieval gates that used to control the traffic in and out of Bruges. Simply stunning! \nCompare the real Bruges to the one depicted in the movie In Bruges.\nFootball at 3 Jan Breydel stadium. The city has two teams playing soccer in First Division A, the Belgian top tier: Club Brugge KV and Cercle Brugge KSV. They share the Jan Breydel stadium, capacity 29,000, in Sint-Andries district 2 km west of the centre. (updated Jun 2022)\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nChocolate\nChocolate shops are plentiful and the standard is always high. Word on the street is, that you can get anything covered in chocolate and moulded. A few chocolate shops also let you have a seat an order a homemade chocolate milk or other drink. There is a particularly vast number of chocolate shops at the Katelijnestraat.\n\n1 Stef's, Breidelstraat 18 (between Markt and Burg). A fairly cheap option. (updated Aug 2020)\n2 Chocolatier Van Oost, Wollestraat 11. If you are willing to spend a little more, Chocolatier Van Oost on Wollestraat is a must for high-quality artisanal chocolate. (updated Aug 2020)\n3 Dumon, Eiermarkt 6, \u260f +32 50 34 62 82. Excellent, very high-end chocolate creations. They also make chocolate drinks. \n4 Het Chocoladehuisje, Wollestraat 15, \u260f +32 50 34 02 50. Artisan chocolates. Place where you can buy the original chocolate breasts. Has a nice piece in their window on special occasions. \n5 The Chocolate Line, Simon Stevinplein 19, \u260f +32 50 34 10 90. Almost always has original and funny chocolate-art in their window. Run by a (locally) famous chocolatier, Dominique Persoone. Fame comes with a price: The Chocolate Line is quite expensive compared to the many other chocolate stores in Bruges. (updated Jun 2017)\nFor those who do not wish to buy chocolate in the chocolate shops, the local supermarkets also sell a good variety of mass-produced chocolate at fairly low prices. For the frugal, you can buy 100-200 g gourmet bars of chocolate for about \u20ac1 each. Good brands to buy are C\u00f4te-d'Or and Jacques, both are Belgian.\n\n\nBeer\nIf you don't want anything more than a sampling of the most famous Belgian beers, supermarkets (not night shops!) are probably your best choice. They even have gift packs with glasses. There are also many boutique-style beer shops that sell high-quality gift packs of Belgian beer, as well as beer-focused caf\u00e9s (such as 't Brugs Beertje which has over 300 different types of beer to offer).\n\n\nArt\nThere are plenty of arts and crafts shops too, with some excellent local artists. The lacework is risky: if everything sold was produced locally, the entire town would be working in the lace industry! There is a school for lace though, where you can still get \"the real thing\".\nMost European tourists come for the weekend, so shops are open Tuesday through Sunday, but many shops and museums are closed on Mondays. Be sure to plan ahead.\n\n\nMusic\n6 Rombaux, Mallebergplaats 13, \u260f +32 50 33 25 75. A record, guitar and piano store, run by a friendly family in a landmark building, incredible atmosphere with a huge collection of jazz, classical but also modern records. They further have a guitar and piano instrument department and a good collection of sheet music. (updated Sep 2021)\n\n\nEat\n\nIf you are looking for a great place to eat in Bruges, avoid all of the restaurants in the central market square (\"Grote Markt\"). No matter how pleasant the view from there may look, they will offer you low-quality, overpriced food, served to you by waiters who are as rude and as slow as they are underpaid. One tactic used by such tourist trap restaurants at the central market is to present items (e.g. bread) as if they were free with your meal, then charge you for them. Even water may be charged at an exorbitant \u20ac6 or more for a small bottle. Another scheme to bilk the traveller is to quote absurdly-high prices (such as \u20ac7 for a single serving of fries), then claim to be offering \"a 10% discount for locals\".\nYou will, however, find great food if you wander off the beaten track. The historical centre of Bruges does have many pleasant and cozy restaurants with affordable and high-quality food to offer if you know the right addresses! Find a street with more locals than tourists and ask somebody about a good place to eat at. The locals will be glad to help (English proficiency in Dutch-speaking Belgium is generally quite good).\n\n\nBudget\n1 Books & Brunch, Garenmarkt 30, \u260f +32 50 70 90 79. Tu-F 08:30-18:00, Sa 09:00-18:00. An ideal combo of second hand book store and a brunch/dessert-eatery (but you can just have a cup of coffee or a tea too). (updated Aug 2022)\n2 The Olive Street Food, Wollestraat 12, \u260f +32 50 41 50 96. W-M 12:00-20:30. An authentic Greek takeaway place just a minute of walking away from the Belfry/Grote Markt. They offer food that is not only well-seasoned and extraordinarily savoury, but also very affordable, especially compared to other places to eat at in the Bruges' historical centre. \u20ac6.5 for a medium-sized wrap, \u20ac11 for a larger box of food (Sept 2021). (updated Aug 2022)\n3 Brasserie Medard, Sint-Amandsstraat 18, \u260f +32 50 34 86 84. Huge deal for low budget just near the centre: a mountain of (tasty) spaghetti with tomato sauce, cheese, and mushrooms for \u20ac3. Two options on the menu: vegetarian, non-vegetarian - both at the same price. Double its size for just \u20ac2 extra. Very cheap beer too (kriek at \u20ac1.50) (all prices as of July 2010). Most tables order the spaghetti. Tourists aren't welcome until they sit: be sure to sit down and impose your presence to be served. If you wait to be seated, you are likely to be sent away for no reason. (updated Aug 2022)\n4 Le Pain Quotidien, Simon Stevinplein 15, \u260f +32 50 34 29 21. A sandwich chain founded in Brussels but now found in the US, France and a number of other countries. Most of the food is organic, and the sandwiches (in particular the Tartine Bouef Basilic) are delicious. Somewhat expensive. (updated Aug 2022)\n5 The Potato Bar, Sint-Amandsstraat 31, \u260f +32 50 33 91 19. One of the better fries shops (frietkoten/frituren) Bruges has to offer. Both classic fries with mayonnaise as well as burgers and fries with a variety of toppings available. Vegetarian options. \u20ac3-4.5 for fries with toppings, \u20ac8-11 for a burger (Sept 2021). (updated Aug 2022)\n6 Cropains, Geldmuntstraat 21. Not much indoor seating, but delicious \"croque monsieurs\" (grilled sandwiches) and wraps, with vegetarian options. \u20ac6-\u20ac8 for a grilled sandwich or wrap. (updated Aug 2022)\n\n\nMid-range\n7 Brasserie Foresti\u00e8re, Academiestraat 11. Nice and calm restaurant, good food, not too expensive. Good menu for vegetarians. Meal of the day (soup, main dish, dessert or coffee/tea) costs \u20ac14 (May 2019) although this is the cheapest menu it has little choice. (updated Aug 2022)\n8 L'Estaminet, Park 5, cafelestaminet@telenet.be. Good food, nice terrace, cool bartender. Try the renowned spaghetti for \u20ac13, or the delicious croque monsieur for \u20ac10. \n9 De Bottelier, Sint-Jakobsstraat 63. A favourite restaurant of many of Bruges' residents. Very reasonable prices and excellent food. Closed Sunday and Monday nights. (updated Aug 2022)\n10 Tom's Diner, West Gistelhof 23. Fantastic upmarket take on satisfying, home cooked food. Prices are reasonable, as well. (updated Aug 2022)\n11 Petite Aneth, Maria van Bourgondi\u00eblaan 1, \u260f +32 50 31 11 89. With only 7 tables, small and cosy, with a personal touch. (updated Aug 2022)\n12 Cambrinus, Philipstockstraat 19 (near the market place), \u260f +32 5033 2328. 11:00-23:00 daily. This is a very popular place, and for a reason. They have some of the best selection of Belgian beers, more than 440 in total. Some beers have really odd names like Satan, Lucifer, Nostradamus, or the Brunette. It's primarily a restaurant though, as all their hearty food are prepared with a special kind of beer. It's really delicious. Mains go for \u20ac17-19, but they also have the \u20ac26 prix fixe \"Menu van de Brouwer\", which features several Trappist beers. Make a reservation in advance, as else they might not have any seats available. \u20ac25-30. \n13 Grand Cafe Passage, Dweersstraat 26, \u260f +32 5034 0232.

A seasonal riverboat goes there on a cruise of 35 minutes each way. It's a very scenic trip, the landscapes are picturesque, and the village of Damme even more so. You can also go there by bike (special route). Local bus service to Damme is very limited and a trip from the Bruges railway station takes 24 minutes.\nSluis is a charming small historic city just across the Netherlands border, where the Damse Vaart (Damme Canal) terminates. Very popular among Belgians to go shopping on Sundays, as the shops are all open there then. A direct bus (line 42) connects Bruges to Sluis, or you could go there by bicycle on the bike path along the Damse Vaart (17 km).\nYpres (Ieper) is an important site of Great War battles, cemeteries, monuments and traditions such as the Last Post (every evening). Very popular among old veterans and young boys interested in wars. Sadly the public-transport connection between Ypres and Bruges isn't great, a train ride takes 1 hr 30 min, and a combination of train and bus still takes at least 1 hr. So trips to Ypres are only advisable when you have a car available.\nOstend (Oostende) is the monumental beach resort, called queen of the coastal cities resort. King Leopold II (1865-1909) built before his attention turned to inner-city Brussels to build his new capital. The quintessential cosmopolitan 19th-century beach resort, full of endearing villas that have been classified as official monuments. Less than 15 minutes by train. Close by, about 10 min by tram towards Raversijde, you can find the Atlantic Wall, two kilometres of trenches and galleries dating from both World Wars.\nDe Haan is a beach resort with many fanciful buildings in the belle \u00e9poque style. Residential streets are lined by many quaint houses. De Haan is an easy side-trip from Bruges by train to Ostend and then by the coastal tram (Kusttram) to the station De Haan aan Zee.\nGhent, Brussels and Antwerp are great tourist destinations in their own right, and very easy to reach by train (30 minutes to Ghent, 1 hr to Brussels and Antwerp).",
