Bathrooms are clean and free, but usually have no toilet paper.\n\n\nGoing to Uruguaiana\nCompany Crucero del Norte operates a regular urban service that goes all the way to Uruguaiana, for 8 reais or similar price in pesos. \nStopping at the 1 Argentine customs is mandatory for all: the bus driver will collect passengers' documents and handle the procedures. However, if you are traveling on documents other than Argentine or Brazilian, you should also stop at the Brazilian border post to get stamped \u2014 you might need to reminder the driver about it as most people traveling this route are locals who do not need it.\n\nTimetable from Paso de los Libres to Uruguaiana\n\nThe bus calls at the 2 bus stop across the road from the bus station about 20 minutes after the times listed above.\nIt later calls on a 3 bus stop after the bridge, on another one in \n4 Uruguaiana downtown, and later on the 5 bus stop closest to Uruguaiana bus station, from where it's a 5-block walk eastwards.\nShould you prefer not to wait for the bus, merely standing at the bus stop near the bus station will already attract offers of transport to Uruguaiana from not-so-official taxis. As of Jun 2018, the going rate was 50 pesos per person. Renting a full car (remise) would set you 300 pesos as of January 2019. Or you can catch a city bus to the Argentinian migration for 15 pesos and then hitch a ride to cross the bridge.\n\n\nGet around\n\n\nSee\n\n\nDo\n\n\nBuy\n\n\nEat\n\n\nDrink\n\n\nSleep\n\n\nConnect\n\n\nGo next\nUruguaiana\nPosadas",
