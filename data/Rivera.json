  "extract": "Rivera is a city in the northern interior of Uruguay. It's the capital of Rivera Department, located on the border with Brazil, right across from the Brazilian city of Santana do Livramento. Full of large hills and cheap shopping, Rivera's main attraction is its location on the border. Uruguayans come for the inexpensive goods on the Brazilian side, and Brazilians come for the duty-free shops on the Uruguayan side. Travellers from other countries can take advantage of both. Rivera also gives you the chance to stand with a foot in each country\u2014a cool photo opportunity.\nTo a large extent, Rivera and Santana function as one city: you can easily take a day trip from one to the other without even bringing your passport. You may not even notice you're crossing the border, which is marked by inconspicuous white border markers. If you decide to venture further into the other country, though, make sure to stop at immigration (located next to Si\u00f1eriz Shopping) to get your passport stamped out of one country and into the other.\nThat being said, they are two different cities, with separate bus systems and administration and somewhat different vibes. Being in Uruguay, Rivera tends to be a bit more expensive than Santana, serves more Uruguayan foods like chivitos and milanesas, and has more Spanish than Portuguese. On both sides of the border, though, it's not uncommon to have a conversation where one side is speaking Spanish and the other Portuguese, or where both sides are speaking Portu\u00f1ol, a mixture of the two languages.\n\n\nUnderstand\n\n\nTourist information\n1 Divisi\u00f3n Turismo de la Intendencia de Rivera (Tourism Office of the Municipality of Rivera), Agraciada 570 floor -1, \u260f +598 4623 1900 (int. 177), turismo@rivera.gub.uy. (updated Mar 2017)\n2 Information kiosk, Sarand\u00ed between Francisco Acu\u00f1a de Figueroa and Faustino Car\u00e1mbula streets, turismo@rivera.gub.uy. (updated Mar 2017)\n\n\nGet in\n\n\nBy car\nRivera is on Uruguay Route 5 from Montevideo and Route 27 from Vichadero.\nFrom Brazil, take BR-158 to Santana do Livramento and cross the Uruguayan border to enter Rivera.\n\n\nBy bus\nIntercity buses from nearby cities and from Montevideo arrive at the 1 Rivera Bus Terminal in central Rivera.\n\n\nBy train\nFrom Tacuaremb\u00f3 there's twice weekly (Monday and Friday) a train. The train leaves at 7:00 in Tacuarembo and arrives at 9:10 at the 2 Rivera Train Station. For the return trip, leaving Rivera at 18:00 and arriving in Tacuarembo at 20:10 (Monday and Friday).\n\n\nBy plane\nRivera International Airport (RVY  IATA) no longer has regular commercial flights. The nearest commercial airport is Rubem Berta International Airport (URG IATA), in the Brazilian city of Uruguaiana, by 233 km from Rivera. On the Uruguayan side of the border, the nearest airport to Rivera is Carrasco International Airport (MVD IATA) in Montevideo, 511 km away.\n\n\nGet around\nRivera is small enough to get around by walking. The main street is called Sarand\u00ed.\nThere are also local bus lines and taxis.\n\n\nSee\n1 Plaza Internacional (Parque Internacional de la Amistad). Put one foot in Brazil and one foot in Uruguay. Has some mom-and-pop shops with crafts that make nice souvenirs.  (updated May 2017)\n2 Plaza Artigas, Artigas and Sarand\u00ed. The city's main plaza, which includes a large fountain for kids to play in and a sculpture of national hero Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas. (updated Aug 2017)\n3 Parque Gran Breta\u00f1a. Attractive park with an artificial lake, walking trails, and a waterfall tucked in the woods. Be aware, the area does have some snakes.  (updated May 2017)\n4 Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n (Church of the Immaculate Conception), Monse\u00f1or Jacinto Vera between Agraciada and Sarand\u00ed (in front of Plaza Artigas).

Be careful here at night...the summit happens to be a popular place to smoke marijuana. (updated Aug 2017)\n\n\nDo\n Kite flying. In most of Uruguay kite flying is a September activity, but Riverenses (along with residents of Salto and Tacuaremb\u00f3) traditionally do it during Holy Week, the week before Easter. (updated May 2017)\n\n\nBuy\nLots of shopping, including duty-free shops chiefly catering to Brazilians, on Sarand\u00ed, the main street, especially near the border. Uruguayans aren't allowed to shop at the duty-free shops\u2014you have to show a foreign ID such as a passport to make purchases at them. Santana also has lots of stores on its side of the border, where Uruguayans go to buy cheap goods.\nPrices tend to be listed in pesos in Rivera and in reais in Santana, but stores on both sides are happy to accept either currency. Currency exchange places, as well as lots of stands selling contraband, can be found on the border near the Plaza Internacional. The unlicensed currency exchange stands right on the border offer very good rates, better than the official exchange places nearby. They accept US dollars as well as pesos and reais.\nBeyond the wide selection of duty-free shops, small stands, and cheap stores near the border, there are a couple of larger malls:\n\n1 Si\u00f1eriz Shopping, Sep\u00e9 51, \u260f +598 4624 1000, sineriz@sineriz.com.uy. Mall including duty-free shops and the only movie theater in town.  (updated May 2017)\n2 Melanc\u00eda, \u260f +598 4624 3000. Mall including some duty-free shops. (updated May 2017)\n\n\nEat\nA Riverense specialty is xis, a sort of cheeseburger-like sandwich. You can also find standard Uruguayan fare like milanesas, chivitos, and pizza, as well as Brazilian-style restaurants like pay-by-the-kilo buffets. Naturally, Brazilian restaurants are more plentiful on their side of the border.\nRivera is one of the few places in the world that once had a McDonald's but no longer does\u2014the large McDonald's that was built near the border couldn't attract enough business and finally had to close.\n\n1 El Rey de las Empanadas, Sarand\u00ed 799 (corner of Sarand\u00ed and Lavalleja), \u260f +598 462 36149.
