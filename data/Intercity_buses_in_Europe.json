  "title": "Intercity buses in Europe",
  "extract": "While Europe has had buses for well over a century, and intercity lines had their share in some countries, on the continent as a whole, intercity buses were long overshadowed by railways. This started to change in the 2010s, when several intercity bus companies expanded services across the continent.\nToday, bus travel is often the cheapest mode of transportation between cities. Comfort has improved greatly since the 1980s, with air conditioning and Wi-Fi on board. However, buses mostly compete on price as they can't even hope to begin to compete on speed with high-speed rail or air travel, and legroom is usually rather limited compared to trains. Thus far, no operator has tried for the \"luxury bus\" segment that can be seen for example in Mexico.\n\n\nUnderstand\nFor a long time buses in Europe were subject mostly to national regulation and an international market didn't exist or only as a small niche. Apart from local and city buses run by or on behalf of local government, there were \"railway buses\" or \"rail replacement\" bus in many places that duplicated former rail lines. Postal services also ran some buses, and in the Nordic countries there are still places that get their mail on the same vehicle that serves as the bus link to the outside world. Spain, the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries and the former Yugoslavia have had extensive intercity coach networks for decades, but the situation was different across much of the rest of the continent. For logical reasons there was no desire for those state-run enterprises who held a monopoly or something close to it on bus travel to compete with the \u2013 similarly state run \u2013 railways along lines where rail service existed. Thus only secondary routes \u2013 if that \u2013 were served in many countries. However, in the 2010s, France, Germany, Italy and the EU deregulated the market, allowing private entrants to compete with railways on international routes. Other countries have similarly taken first steps in this direction or have announced plans to that effect.\n\n\nRoute planners\nBusradar is a handy timetable and price searching website offering information from some different bus companies. It is in no way complete.\nRome2Rio includes intercity and international bus route information.\n\n\nInternational carriers\nAlsa International is a company centred on Spain with services to fourteen other European countries and Morocco.\nBlablaCar Bus operates in France and to most of France's neighbours.\nEurolines operates in some countries.\nFlixbus is a German company which dominates domestic routes in some countries and international routes in many countries of Europe.\nRegiojet, also operating under the name Student Agency, is a Czech company that operates an extensive network of buses and some trains in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and is expanding its bus service into most of Europe.\nThere are also many regional companies.\n\n\nCountries and regions\nThe market looks quite different in different parts of the continent. While intercity services were nearly non-existent in France and Germany until 2010, due to the regulation, coaches were and still are the main mode of transport e.g. in the Balkans and in much of the Nordic countries.\n\n\nBalkans\nBus travel in former Yugoslavia\n\n\nFrance\nSee also: France#By bus 2\nThe French intercity bus market was only opened after the German market. Big players are German FlixBus and French BlaBlaCar Bus. Do compare train and bus prices and travel times as sometimes the TGV is considerably faster while only costing marginally more.\n\n\nGermany\nSee also: Intercity buses in Germany\nThe Long Distance Bus (German: Fernbus) market in Germany was tightly regulated and in effect limited to a handful of routes to and from Berlin dating to the period of German partition prior to the 2010s. There were a few international lines serving the Yugoslav and Turkish diaspora as well as some operators to countries east of the former Iron Curtain, but overall buses played a niche role at best and were clearly subservient to the railways. A change in laws dramatically changed this situation and while initially several domestic and foreign bus companies, some of them with potent parent companies like the German railways or postal service or the British operators Megabus (Stagecoach) and National Express vied for the new market, a fierce competition on price and a few mergers soon whittled down the market to one where Flixbus offers well north of 90% of the route km. The \"pioneers\" of DeinBus who started out as a bus-based ride sharing service before the law was changed are still around, but other than that the only competition Flixbus faces is on international routes (and sometimes domestic parts of international routes) where foreign operators exist.\nBus stations in general were overwhelmed by the rapid growth of the market and even major cities still have buses departing from little more than a curbside with all the traffic problems that entails. Berlin, Hamburg and Munich have dedicated bus stations and more cities are in the process of building them, but overall you shouldn't expect too much.\nDespite buses often stopping at or near train stations, there is no cooperation between bus and train operators. Flixbus also integrated the trains it runs into its bus ticketing system.\n\n\nNordic countries\nSee also: Rail and bus travel in Sweden\nIntercity coaches in the Nordic countries are comfortable and reliable (although cheap alternatives, such as Onnibus, may use older buses and offer little legroom). Coaches and buses have a long history, also on intercity routes, even on some very long ones with or without train competition. Deregulation in the 2000s caused changes on the market and brought some important new players, especially between big cities in Denmark, Finland and southern Norway and Sweden, and some old companies, big and small, have left the market. In some parts of the countries the changes have been small from the travellers' perspective. The systems vary somewhat between the countries.\nBus stations are usually centrally located, sometimes in connection with the railway station. In Finland many bus stations offices have been abandoned even in big cities, with what is left of the service moved to a nearby shop or caf\u00e9.\nIn Denmark long distance services between Jutland and Copenhagen used to be a matter of preference rather than cost, but a number of low cost bus lines have begun crossing the country at much lower prices, albeit also at a much more limited schedule. Abildskou is the established long distance operator with up to 9 departures each day to various cities in Jutland. R\u00f8d Billet is a cheaper player, with departures limited to 1\u20134 per day. There are also coach connections to Oslo and Stockholm, and to and through Germany.\nIn Finland there are many companies, large and small, mostly on routes coordinated by the public sector. Although there is regulation, such as maximum prices, the companies are independent. The intercity coaches are mostly express services. There is a private company, Matkahuolto, with offices (or cooperating businesses) at most bus stations, providing centralized services such as timetables, ticket sale and freight, although the individual companies may offer services also at their own terms (such as discounts for advance bookings on the net). There is one budget intercity company, Onnibus, which has become the dominant player on the intercity market (book well in advance on the net to get the bargains), while less trafficked routes remain in the hands of the traditional companies. These latter still have some services also along the main intercity routes, especially catering to towns along the way. Onnibus has some problematic restrictions on children, pets, bikes and luggage, and offers little legroom (unless you pay extra). Despite buses often stopping at or near train stations, there is little cooperation between bus and train operators.\nAs the Gulf of Bothnia separates Finland from the rest of the countries, there are no intercity coaches across the borders, except in the far north (there are routes e.g. from Rovaniemi to Troms\u00f8, Alta and Tana, by Eskelisen Lapin linjat), and some services at Haparanda/Tornio extend slightly across the border. There are also a few intercity services to Russia, mostly by Russian companies, some of them with minibuses instead of coaches.\nIceland has no railways, so intercity travel is mostly by bus, car or plane.\nThere is an extensive network of express buses in Norway, with NOR-WAY Bussekspress and Boreal Transport being the biggest operators. Vy buss also runs some express routes. Lavprisekspressen aims at providing a cheap alternative on some routes. Schedules and frequencies vary greatly, and seating may be limited. Rutebok.no offers a centralized connection search. There are international connections in the far north to Finland and Russia, from some cities to Sweden and to several destinations from Oslo.\nIn Sweden traffic operated by the counties (l\u00e4n) dominate in most of the country, but in the busy southern third there are also independent actors. Some of these routes cross the borders to Denmark (including lines going much farther) and Norway.\n\n\nSwitzerland\nAfter a similar ban on bus routes was lifted in the 2010s, Flixbus and the Swiss partner company Eurobus tried regular and scheduled long-distance bus routes within Switzerland. After a single year, the experiment was stopped, and there is no such bus service anymore - except some alpine postal lines that mainly cater to tourists. One famous example is the eight-hour bus line over four alpine passes, starting and ending in Meiringen; with +/- 20 minutes long breaks on the alpine passes (Grimsel, Nufenen, Gotthard and Susten), and a longer noon break in Airolo, or the route Zernez - Pass Umbrail (2501 meters) - Tirano - Sondrio - Lugano (9 hours 20). These services run during the summer months only.\nOther than that, Flixbus, Eurolines and other companies offer many international connections - mainly to Germany, southern France, Italy, Poland and the Balkan countries.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSee also: Bus travel in the United Kingdom\nThe intercity bus market in the United Kingdom was one of the first in Europe to be deregulated, which \u2013 in addition to the \"Beeching Axe\" of railways in the 1960s, which greatly reduced the available route miles in the motherland of rail travel \u2013 created one of the most competitive markets for intercity buses (known as coaches) in the world. While new entrants to certain markets still try to undercut the established players through loss-leading prices, the market has mostly consolidated with a handful of players controlling most routes. Stations are often somewhat at the outskirts of town to enable faster publicised travel times, but correspondingly longer journeys for passengers wanting to reach a city centre. Operators include:\n\nNational Express\nMegabus\nCitylink\nFlixbus\n\n\nBorder crossing\nWhile many European countries are within the Schengen area, some borders are subject to passport checks. In many cases, the bus company is liable for passengers without proper documentation. Therefore, the carrier might request papers at boarding. Without passport or ID, passengers might be refused, even with a valid ticket. In some countries international buses may be stopped on the road by police for spot-checks of identity or luggage.\n\n\nSee also\nCycling in Europe\nDriving in Europe\nIntercity buses in the United States",
